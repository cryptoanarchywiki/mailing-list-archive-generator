We're not talking about giving up on names.

You have lots of names for things -- some of them are even nicknames, known
only to you.

For any certification scheme, you also need a unique name.

If you happen to use the public key as that unique name, you have the
proposal we're talking about.  It has an advantage -- that you don't
have to certifiy the binding between the unique name and the key.
That's built in.
