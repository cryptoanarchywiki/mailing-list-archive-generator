your request worked. Use the password you sent to them to decrypt the msg 
you received... I spent alot of days waiting for something to happen when 
I first registered, I think the name or password I was trying to use had 
already been used. If that is the case, alpha.c2.org dosn't respond at 
all. It took me awhile to figure that out. Once I selected a name and 
password that no one else was using... It worked...
