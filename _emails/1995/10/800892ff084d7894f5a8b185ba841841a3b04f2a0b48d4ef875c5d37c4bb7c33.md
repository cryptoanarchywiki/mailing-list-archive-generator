	Account cancellations are automated. The account holder is
notified if pending deactivation 14, 7, and 3 days before the account
is deactivated. It is the remailer-operator's responsibility to notify
the world that the remailer will be going down. It is not my
responsibility to keep track of which remailers are running on c2.org
and which aren't.
