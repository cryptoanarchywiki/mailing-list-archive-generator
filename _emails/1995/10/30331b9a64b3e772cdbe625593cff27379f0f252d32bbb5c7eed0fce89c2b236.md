The two big drawbacks for me in this offer are:

	*  The contract gives them the right to demand that I pay for
	   anything that they spend investigating their "rights,
	   remedies, and security interests".  Not if I sue them.  Not
	   if they win.  ANYTIME.  I could send them email, and get
	   back a bill for the employee time spent answering it.  And
	   I've agreed to pay such bills, if I sign their contract.

	* You pay 4% -- in the BEST deal -- on every transaction.  The
	   high-initial-fee merchant account still charges you 2% on
	   the way in, and 2% on the way out.  You don't even have to
	   spend any of it, you pay for just moving money among your
	   accounts.  If both payer and payee are using one of the
	   low-initial-fee accounts, the total loss could be as much as
	   10%.

There's lots of little drawbacks too.
I sure hope the competition arrives soon.

	John
