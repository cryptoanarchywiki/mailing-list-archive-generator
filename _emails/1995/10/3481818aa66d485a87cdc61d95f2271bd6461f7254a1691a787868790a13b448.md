This doesn't work for you? Please get back to me if you figure it out. 
I'd like to document the problem accurately.

I can confirm that the complete(floppy) version of Windows 95 
STILL has the ../ bug ;-( The ... bug has been fixed correctly 
returning the following message
chkpath: ERRDOS - ERRbadpath (Directory invalid.)
But cd ../ WILL put you in the root directory of the share
with the rights you had in the intial directory. Very bad...
I've had to share all my drives read-only until the problem 
gets fixed.
