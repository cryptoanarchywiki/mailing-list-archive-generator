Hi all.

Just a warning to steer clear of Netscape 2.0 on Linux. It can't
resolve FQDNs, its distributed as a staticly linked a.out binary
*AGAIN*, and I'm hearing lots of reports sitting here on IRC that it
locks up R6 versions of XFree solid on a random basis. Not to mention
that there is no java support yet for Linux, and the Java support in
the Sun/Windows version of netscape is based on the new (and
imcompatible with earlier versions) beta version of Java which sun
pimped out to Netscape and won't release the source code too.

The part about not resolving FQDNs might be an undocumented
feature. The most secure transaction is one that doesn't take place at
all. ;)

Have fun,
Christopher
