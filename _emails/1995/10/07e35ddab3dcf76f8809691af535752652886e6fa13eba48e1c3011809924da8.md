	Our wonderful house at Bryant's Bend in Palo Alto, is 
celebrating (our new housemate) Joyce Fortune's tenth anniversary of 
coming out as a lesbian. She has since become bi and celebrates bi'ness 
with the rest of us here at our veggie co-op.

	Join us in the wonderful celebrations, gaming and frolic.
Come in costume as butch or fem (lingerie is most desired). All uncostumed 
guests will be bounced by our tall african-american femmi bouncer (Go Frankie!). 

The particulars:


	When:   Saturday Night (October 14, 1995)
	Time:   7:00 to late
	Where:	130 Bryant St.
		Palo Alto CA

	What to bring:  Yourselves, a costume, gay music in cd or 
		tape cassette medium, and any erotic foods and drinks
                you might desire...	        

		We will be providing the atmosphere and some 
		non-alcoholic drinks and munchies.... 


	Directions:

	From 101:  
	
		Take the University Exit that heads West. Follow
