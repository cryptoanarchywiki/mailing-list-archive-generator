  I think the old idea of a certificate just binding a name and
a key is turning out to not be very useful.  That is why Netscape
Navigator 2.0 will support x509 version 3 certificates.  They allow
arbitrary attributes to be signed into a certificate.  In this new
world, you can think of a certificate as a way of binding a key with
various arbitrary attributes, one of which may be(but is not
required to be) a name.
