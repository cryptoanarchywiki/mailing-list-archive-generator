I have heard a lot about the Elementrix POTP encryption algorithm.  I remain
skeptical of this algorithm until the source code is released.

I don't believe this is an error caused by the author's ignorance of 
encryption.  I remember hearing the same exact thing about POTP "not using an
encryption algorithm" from one of the Elementrix spokespeople.

I downloaded the secure email client for windoze and it seemed to make sense.
I might have misunderstood the documentation but it says that it has to
establish a "secure channel" with the other person by reciprocating emails with
what I would guess to be key synchronization data.  FYI, this client is  
available from the Elementrix FTP site at ftp.elementrix.com.
