Well, I was definitely oversimplifying things.

I'm sure that one could be done on one page, but I doubt it would have
the expressive power of a natural language *and* the lack of ambiguity
of Lojban.

And there's feedback between MEX and the non-MEX grammar since there
are cmavo which covert MEX into sumti and selbri and vice versa.

To achieve the goal of the cryptosystem it may not be necessary to
encode the cmavo, since they have no real meaning on their own, just
the gismu and rafsi.  The goal is to hide the *meaning*, not the
structure.

The selma'o that only have one member are especially meaning-free, as
they're typically elidable terminators and such.

In a natural language this might be true, but in Lojban the grammar's
regularity eliminates much of this information.  In English it's
"strange" to say "the red big dog", while "the big red dog" is fine.
Lojban doesn't have these features.  Lojban bridi are essentially
the same as function calls in a programming language, from a grammatical
perspective.  The only distinguishing feature of a selbri is the number
of sumti that it takes, and it's unusual for all of them to be specified,
and extra ones may be added using the BAI selma'o.

Irregularities make this nearly impossible for computers, though.

There are also problems due to ambiguity.

The even bigger inconvenience with natural laguages comes in defining
the codebook.  The limited forms of Lojban gismu and rafsi makes the
whole dictionary a well-defined list, permitting the codebook to be
specified as a single number that anyone could use --- even without
prior exchange of the wordlist.
