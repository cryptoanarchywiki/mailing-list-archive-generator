Hell, to be honest, I don't even fathom 1/2 of what is said around here.. 
but I understand the need to encrypt, have trained myself to use PGP, and 
am polically active.. I mainly use the list for a who's who of crypto and 
a referance guide to whats going on in the field.. <g>

Trust me on this one.. I was the newbie a couple of months ago and 
stepped into it pretty big for my first time out.. Afterwards (of course)
I read the Faq's, and have lurked a lot since.. take this list slow, as 
it will eventually pay out in the info you are looking for..
