I'm not an expert here, but I understand the "well-known methods" to
essentially use some formula that "tends" to generate prime numbers from
uniformly distributed numbers, feed it a "good" random number, and then
check to see if it's really prime.  If it's not, pick another "good"
random number and try again.  The entropy in the prime is the same
as in the random number generator.
