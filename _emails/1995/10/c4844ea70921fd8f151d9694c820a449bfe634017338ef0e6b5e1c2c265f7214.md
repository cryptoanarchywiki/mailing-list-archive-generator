It depends on what is meant by "outside the country." The law forbidding
travel to Cuba, for example, is not enforced by U.S. cops outside the
country, but upon reentry to the U.S. Ditto for other laws, such as those
affecting aid and support of countries we don't like, and the laws about
trading with the enemy.

For the purposes of crypto laws (and many other laws, truth be told),
Canada is treated as a smallish northern state in the U.S.
