  INFOSEC TRAINING AND SECURITY PRODUCTS (TSP) DEPARTMENT
  
   
   
   The INFOSEC Training and Security Products Department is 
responsible
   for developing, coordinating and executing a DoD-wide 
INFOWAR
   education, training and awareness program; creating an 
INFOWAR Career
   Management Program for DoD; and developing, coordinating, 
documenting
   and executing DoD-wide procedures to identify and 
disseminate INFOSEC
   products to meet DoD-wide INFOWAR requirements.
   
   This department of CISS is also responsible for the update 
and
   distribution of the Multilevel Information Systems Security 
Initiative
   (MISSI) Implementation Guide. The MISSI Guide is a planning 
tool,
   enabling DoD and other agencies to determine resource 
requirements to
   implement various MISSI services into their infrastructure.

   [Insert Multilevel Security (MLS) excerpt]

   The MLS Program is partnered with NSA's Multilevel 
Information Systems
   Security Initiative (MISSI). The MISSI Program is intended 
to provide
   a set of MLS technologies that comply with the DoD Goal 
Security
   Architecture. These technologies, when developed over the 
next five
   years, will be implemented in operational environments by 
the MLS
   Program. In the meantime, the MLS Program will continue to 
identify,
   assess, and implement commercially available MLS 
technologies to
   satisfy immediate MLS requirements throughout DoD.

   [End insert]
   
   The DISSPATCH newsletter, an INFOSEC publication is 
published 4 times
   per year by TSP. Electronic copies will be loaded here soon.
   
   The Security Products Database is a stand-alone database 
containing
   information on over 400 security products, to include their 
technical
   characteristics and points of contact.
   
   TSP is also building an INFOSEC Training Facility (ITF) at 
our Falls
   Church, Virginia location. The ITF will provide state of the 
art
   information systems security training to include the suite 
MISSI
   educational offerings.
