  That's true, but it is also true that Netscape should also be
performing some sanity checking on input rather than relying on 
the supporting libraries to be secure. Remember, a hole is a hole.
The last sendmail bug was a buffer overflow in syslog, however,
sendmail still got patched to do bounds checking on the strings
it was passing to syslog. 

  It looks like this is only bug on BSDI2.0/XAccel, and NT3.5/NS1.1. But
is it wise for netscape to be sending 10,000 character strings to GUI
functions anyway?
