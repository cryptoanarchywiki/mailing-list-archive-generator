Boy, if I were you I would want to fix the inadequacy in C'nomicon in
order to protect my positive rep...

You mean Real Life(tm) security a.k.a. force, but this isn't 
necessarily so.  We could just as well debit the double-spender's 
rep and lower the limit on how much e-cash he will be issued.

I hesitate to pipe up in such august company, but one of us is
confused.  The attack that we have been discussing is possible because
Chaumian Ecash allows the payer to identify the payee.  This would be
true whether or not there were any protocols related to
double-spending.  (i.e., because the payer knows the actual ID number
of the bill, she can choose to relate it to the bank and then the bank
can identify who turns in that bill.  Has nothing to do with
double-spending.  If the protocol provided for re-blinding before
depositing the bill then this would not be possible, I think, and 
would still have nothing to do with double-spending.)


> and it's INELEGANT.


I personally think it is beautiful, because it allows for off-line
transactions at a cost of a relatively small risk of double-spending.
Perhaps we could modify the protocol and have the best of both worlds?
I think I'll write a separate post on this subject now...


Regards,

Bryce
