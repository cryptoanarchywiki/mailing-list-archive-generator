I am informed by the webmaster of the page holding the guidelines that 
the Section leadership has authorized him to make the text downloadable 
and that he will make it available in various formats very soon.

This desirable result was, however, in no way helped by what I am also 
informed was juvenile and in at lest one instance threatening email sent 
to the parties involved.   That the mail identified itself as originating 
from members of this list -- and in response to my message announcing the 
site existed -- can only have the result of devaluing any comment I and 
other people on this list may make.

Not a pretty sight.
