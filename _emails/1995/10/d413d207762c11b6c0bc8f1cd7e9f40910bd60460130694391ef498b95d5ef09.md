This has been chatted about for years.  Under California law, failure to
identify yourself is a minor violation.  They always dismiss the next day at
your hearing.  You don't have to carry ID, you just have to identify
yourself (there's a difference).  "my name Jose Jimenez."  You still don't
need ID unless you are operating a motor vehicle on public streets and roads
(or maybe catching a plane).
