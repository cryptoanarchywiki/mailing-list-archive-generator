	Perhaps someone with more semiconductor physics background
can correct me, but my understanding is that some kinds of nuclear
radiation can be used to erase OTP EPROMS.   I suppose this might damage
the crystal lattice badly enough to render the device useless in
some bit positions or reduce data retention time a lot, but I sure
wouldn't bet any security on devices out there not being 
arbitrarily reprogrammable (thus using bits to represent digital
coins in a wallet that get reset when they are spent is not a
good idea).
