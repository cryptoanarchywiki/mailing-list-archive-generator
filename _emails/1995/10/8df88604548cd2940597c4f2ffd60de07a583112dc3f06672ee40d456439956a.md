That wouldn't quite work since the host would notice the parasite in the
middle and could then work out countermeasures.  An important part of a
MITM attack is escaping notice.
 
What if one night the man in the middle drugged you, kidnapped you, placed
you inside a virtual reality machine, replaced your body with a clone, and
established a link between the VR machine and the clone so that you
experience everything the clone experiences and the clone does everything
you intend to do?  Can you prove this has not already happened?
