[me]> Can you elaborate WITH FACTS on the supposed weakness of MD5 ?
                        **********
I wonder what is your definition of facts...

On the contrary real things should be the issue... not random thoughts

The fact that you obviously didn't take the time to do any
search/reading on the subject does not allow you to go on with mad
assumptions...

FYI,  ( false => false ) is a true expression... starting from false
assumption you can demonstrate *anything*
{ if 1+1!=2, lots of things "fall"}

AGAIN, the limit is 2^128 computer operations (as I quoted from the rfc
days ago), which is imo certainly NOT the weakest part of the security
chain...

Do you actually read anything people are mailing or writing ?
</grrrrrrr>

sorry again, I feel tested...
