Canada has a tax treaty with the States. Quebec wants to US permission 
to stay within NAFTA (and the States have already stated this will not be 
automatic). Similarly the PQ also wants to stay within other Canadian 
international treaties. 

I really don't see a separate Quebec becoming even a semblance of a tax 
haven or being  a hint less friendly to US interests than it is now.
We also have very high tax rates (and a bigger debt per cap) up here, 
Quebec's being the worst of all. I do remind you that Canada (french or 
english) is practically a political extension of the States.
