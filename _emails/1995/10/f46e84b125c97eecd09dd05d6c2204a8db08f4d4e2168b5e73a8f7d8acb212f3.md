## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}From: rivaud@rain.org
Date: Sun, 1 Oct 95 05:50:42 PDT
Subject: WHERE did this come from?
Message-ID: <44kgtb$88i@news.rain.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Attatched to this is, (I hope), the header text from a unsolicited e-mail 
message I received.  The return address does not work.  WHY? How can I 
inform the sender that I hope to never receive there material again?

I tried "reply-all" through Eudora, but my reply got bounced back to me 
as undeliverable.

I have removed the content of the original message. I don't know why it 
was sent to me, but it contained material that I found offensive.

Any help, or words of wisdom and enlightenment would be appreciated. 
Information would be nice too.  

Thanks.

-------------header should be below here-------------- i hope...--------
