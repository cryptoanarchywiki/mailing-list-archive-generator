It seems PGP has been too successful.  I downloaded the entire keyring
from keys.pgp.net; it's almost 9Mb of ASCII armour.  However, I can't
get PGP for DOS to process the files.  It, understandably, gives me an
Out Of Memory error.  Is there any sneaky way of getting around this,
barring the obvious switch to PGP for Linux?  It seems PGP is constrained
to the basic DOS 640Kb, or 704Kb if I remove my VGA card.
