Since nobody seemed to mention it: I suspect that most of them also
fail to wipe already reallocated space.

Think about it: some of that space was only overwritten once...

So to be safe I guess make a backup (with a backup utility that doesn't
copy slackspace), wipe the disk, then restore. Also beware programs that
do not properly zero their files when allocating them.

The cliche answer to the original question, I believe, is:
  yes, go to the hardware store and ask for a 'sledgehammer'.


Hope that makes sense...

Jiri
