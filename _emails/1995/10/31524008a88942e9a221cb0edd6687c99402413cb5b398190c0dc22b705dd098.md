Not really, you can use the raw bitstream as OTP. (Which is probably not

Well, you could claim that what they are using is not an algorithm since
it won't run on a Turing machine. At that stage you probably toss the
Church-Turing thesis out the window and get yourself a proper definition
of "algorithm".

Gives a new meaning to the phrase "subliminal channels" :-)
