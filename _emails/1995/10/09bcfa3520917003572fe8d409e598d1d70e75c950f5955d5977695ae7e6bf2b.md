That's true.  You really want to make sure that the merchant you are
giving your money to is the one who has the goods you are interested in.
Perhaps the only way to solve this problem is with some sort of trusted
escrow agency.  The agency would be well known and its reputation could
be verified fairly easily.  Of course there's still the existential
problem of how do you know your connection to the rest of the world
isn't controlled by someone else, but there's really no solution to
that.
