Here's the relevant headers for the bounceback to me, which took an hour:

Translating:

Sent by thunk.process.com                         
12:14 EDT 

Received by alcor.process.com 	
12:10 EDT     -4 minutes (thunk's clock is off)

Received by toad			
  9:10   PDT     0 minutes

Received by uunet			
12:51 EDT     41 minutes

Received by alcor			
13:10 EDT     19 minutes

It looks like there's a considerable delay entering and leaving uunet. I'm not sure which 
machine gets the blame, but it's either toad&uunet, or uunet&alcor.
