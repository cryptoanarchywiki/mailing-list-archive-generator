I suspect that I could easily hack this into Mixmaster in a day or two,
but wouldn't it open you to attacks where Anonymous Fed, say, sends
terrorist kiddy-porn through your remailer and busts your ISP during those
60 days for possession ? I'm not sure if it would be better or worse than
current setups from that point of view. 

I might do it anyway, and set it up to only forward PGP-encrypted 
messages, but I certainly wouldn't be able to keep messages for 60 days 
with only a MB or so to spare.
