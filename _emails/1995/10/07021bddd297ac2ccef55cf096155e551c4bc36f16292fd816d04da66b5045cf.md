I have to admit I'm a little surprised. I think there are a couple conflicting
dynamics here.

On the one hand, many people here see strengthening security and encryption
in use as a no-holds benefit. The more that is out there, the better it is,
and the more its in use, the better off things will be.

On the other hand, Netscape is a hot stock company. Its ok to work for
recognition, and to donate time for the betterment of the community even if
it profits others. (Eventually such things come around, which is the
classic value of a net reputation.) However, when sudden, large profits
hinge on your work, it is harder to take the philosophical route.

Its a tough thing. I can certainly see both sides.
