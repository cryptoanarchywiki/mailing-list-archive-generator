   Another WSJ report is on Lockheed Martin's proposal for a
   new communications satellite system.

   John Markoff writes in The NYT on AT&T's proposed new 12-
   satellites system. $ for Qualcomm.

   Another NYT piece is about "naysayers" of satellite
   services.

   And, Financial Times has a bountiful insert on Information
   Technology, with a lead story on Internet security, black-
   hearted hacking and, to the rescue, princely encryption and
   authentication. Or is the blanco prince a negro hacker?
