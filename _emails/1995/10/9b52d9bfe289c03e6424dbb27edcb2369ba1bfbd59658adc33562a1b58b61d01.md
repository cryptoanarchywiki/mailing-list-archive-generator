	Since there has been a lot of talk about the "man in the middle" 
attack on the secure web servers, has anyone actually considered the 
processing time required to fake a certificate from scratch?
	I haven't really familiarized myself with how the certificates 
are generated, etc, but it's my understanding that they are signed with RSA.

	The few recent factorings of RSA keys have shown that brute force 
attacks are feasable with distributed processing.  Since these projects 
were done "just for the fun of it", wouldn't it seem likley that someone 
(or some people) would take the time and effort to factor the certificate 
signing key?  After all, it would actually be worth something.
