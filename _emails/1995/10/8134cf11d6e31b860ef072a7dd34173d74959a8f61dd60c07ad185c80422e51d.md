I would agree that they know about many catastrophic bugs, perhapse
even most, perhapse not.  That doesn't mean they have been fixed.

I have been involved in a fair number of beta test programs (as a
tester for the compony relasing the product, as a programmer for
the compony relasing the product, and as a user recieveing the
product to be tested).  Most had catastrophic bugs (varying from
crashing for programs written in C, to kicking you out of the run
time enviroment for programs witten in APL) that were known about
when the product was shipped to testers.  The others we had absoultly
no doubt that such bugs would be found by testers.

Perhapse Netscape is diffrent, but I don't see why they would be.
Certinally I can make Netscape 2.0b1 crash, and I doubt people at
Netscape were foolish enough to think that it wouldn't.

Yes the principal reason for having a Beta is to find bugs you don't
know about.  That does *not* mean you need to remove all known bugs
before you start the Beta ('tho it does cut down on the number of
duplicate reports - many testers fail to read the known bug list).

There are also some less noble reasons to have a Beta (like the
PERT chart says the Beta starts October 8th or the project will
start to slip, and many more).  There is no real evidence that
this applys to Netscape so I won't go into them.

Yes, and this would be diffrent from my point of view in what way?
(i.e. I agree and wonder why you botherd to mention it)

Well a number of people on this list seem to be pooh-pooing the reward
program.  Rightfully or not that could gennerate bad press.  Also
reporters have their own set of thought processes and may decide this
is bad for some reason.  Or not.

(I'm not sure they have ever gone out and said the Beta software isn't
secure.  Hopefully people realise that beta code doesn't allways do
everything it hopes to, and will not assume it is secure just because
it has a goal of being secure.)

Again I agree.  In fact I think the $0 they were paying before the
reward program was enough that I sent in reports on anything I could
reproduce.

You havn't done a very effictave job of disagreeing with me.  I
said Netscape offers you X in exchange for Y, and if X isn't enough
for you do want to do Y, then don't do Y.  You said X is a very
good offer for Y, and you intend to take them up on it.  The two
are not mutually exclusave (in fact the two views are somewhat
supportave of each other).  

Which ones of us doesn't understand the other?
