Except that the list would _have_ to have been subscribed to itself
_before_ that particular Welcome message would have gone out.

Sort of a binding issue. I would prefer the Welcome message to always say
the command is:

     unsubscribe cypherpunks yournamehere

and

     subscribe cypherpunks yournamehere



But this is presumably a Majordomo feature. In any case, let's hope
subscribing the list to itself is not a trend.
