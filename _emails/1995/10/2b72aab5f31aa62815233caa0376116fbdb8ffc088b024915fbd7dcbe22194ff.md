Not a new problem BTW as in the old joke:  "The Iliad wasn't written by
Homer but by another guy of the same name."

For the non-classically inclined, this is a joke because we don't really
know anything about Homer anyway.  Maybe he was a blind poet.  Maybe he
never existed.

"Who wonders why his local B&N StuporStore has 1/2 of one section of one
shelf unit dedicated to classics and shelf unit upon shelf unit dedicated to
the gender-disabled, to women, to native americans, to new age mysticism,
and other garbage.  Particularly since those interest areas represent the
losers.  Who's interested in losers?  (We know they're losers BTW because
we're *reading* about them in a capitalist store.  If they'd won there'd be
no reading and no store."
