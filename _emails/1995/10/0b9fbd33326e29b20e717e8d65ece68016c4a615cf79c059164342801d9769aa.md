Especially since you didn't want anyone to know that you had that
coin in the first place.  This makes it somewhat more difficult to
announce to the world "Hey!  He just stole my coin!".

Careful here.  A given nym's transactions are known only if the
person that they were dealing with chooses to collude with the bank
and reveal it.  Hopefully this would not be the status quo!  (If the
status quo is going to be non-privacy, then we will be using a
different scheme in the first place...)


I mean: it is always true that a person who gave you money can say
"yeah, that's the guy I gave it to."  The only way that this is 
different from tangible cash is that the payer can *prove* to the 
bank that you are the recipient of their money.  And probably the 
bank and the payer together can prove it to the rest of the world.  
(Hm.  Would they be able to prove it?  Perhaps the only way they 
would be able to prove that would be to time-stamp all their 
coins!...)


 "'Hal'":

Again I see an opportunity for "polymorphism".  A bank can use the
very same, or at least a very similar protocol to service both
account-holders and "check-in/check-out" customers.  (Perhaps the
only differences would be the speed with which the bank services the
requests, and the rate at which the bank charges for the service.)


I am excited about polymorphism (such as 
<a href="http://www.communities.com/paper/agnostic.html> Douglas
Barne's "identity-agnostic" idea </a>) because of
social-engineering, evolutionary reasons.  Flexible protocols will
encourage institutions to compete by offering as much privacy,
security, off-line capability, efficiency, etc. as the customers
want, rather than dictating their own terms and trying to define the
market that way.  To the degree to which each capability is
economically beneficial, that capability will become the market
standard.
