Several people have asked me about Internet Security Review. As far as I
can tell I must have registered for a free copy sometime in the recent
past. I think it was on firewalls that I saw it first mentioned. At any
rate, there is a little fold out thingy in the back with some questions
on it to register for a free copy or pass it on to a friend. This appears
to be the introductory issue.

Here's what it looks like:
