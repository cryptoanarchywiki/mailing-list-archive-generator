I agree.  The whole of the post to which you responded was directed to
the point that MITM is virtually impossible in the real world.  Since
as little as one successful communication can reveal his presence,
Mitch must cover *all* avenues his victims may use.

Once again.  That's what I said.  "Going around Mitch" is another way
of saying "using (yet) another channel", one which you haven't tried
before, meaning more diversity in the channels.

This goes back to the issue of why you care about the identity of the
key owner.  Presumably you have some knowledge of Alice which may be
verified by physical presence, or Alice carries some credentials which
are sufficiently difficult to forge.  Barring something like this,
though, you *can't* know whether there's a MITM --- but barring prior
knowledge of Alice, you don't care who's behind the key.
