Indeed, this is not an effective MITM attack. The spoofer certainly cannot
read messages encrypted to my public key (though he can read messages
encrypted to the public key offered above in his message...not a new
situation). And he cannot sign messages that others can match to the keys I
gave them, or that got put into the web of trust.

So, what is it? Is it a "denial of service" attack? Not really.

It's a "denial of clueless service" attack, in that anyone who tries to use
that key and then send me stuff gets to have their stuff _thrown away_,
which is always helpful in the war against cluelessness. Good riddance.
