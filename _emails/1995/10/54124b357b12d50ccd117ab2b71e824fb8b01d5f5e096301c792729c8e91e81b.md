One way to deflect this attack is to encrypt the message for storage
using a symmetric-key algorithm with a randomly generated session key,
and send the session key to the recipient with the notification.
You still have 300 MB of planted kiddy-terrorist narcopornography on your
machine,
but it's encrypted and you can happily tell the judge that you _can't_
decrypt it because you don't have the key.  The Feds _could_ get the
keys by eavesdropping on your outgoing correspondence or using
your system to send the material to themselves (or a conveniently employed
child), but at least you're not storing it in plaintext.

More of a problem with this system is that it's only useful for terminal
remailers; to use it in the middle of a chain, the next remailer would
need to be configured to auto-accept such messages, or else your remailer
would need to have a list of known remailers and use direct delivery
for all mail sent to them.
