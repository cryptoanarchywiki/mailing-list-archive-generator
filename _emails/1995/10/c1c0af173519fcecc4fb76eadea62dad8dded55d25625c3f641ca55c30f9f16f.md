Well I tried the next obvious place and it is actually there. Look at:

 Voila, your pre-schooler is playing with MacPGP. Actually you're not quite home free yet. Right now I'm trying to use Anarchie to hunt down FaceSpan Extension v2.0.1. The specific URL given in the docs points to a rather unresponsive host.
