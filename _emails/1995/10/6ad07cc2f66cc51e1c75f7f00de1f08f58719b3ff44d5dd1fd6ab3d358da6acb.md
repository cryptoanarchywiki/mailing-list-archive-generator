This doesn't really help.  The only information that's different in
this approach is in fields that are removed by the remailer before it
goes to the folks who get upset.  I suppose it might improve the
traffic analysis situation somewhat, though, by making it harder
for the analyst to collect all the data.

Why bother?  It means all the remailers need to share the same key,
making it impossible to add a new remailer without verifying that it
isn't a CoS/NSA/FBI/whatever tentacle.

A vastly simpler solution would be to have all the remailers scanning
all the time, and only forwarding those messages encrypted with its
key.

This also significantly overestimates the efficiency of news propagation.
Two remailers at distant parts of the net see news messages arrive
in different orders --- often a message received at one point won't
reach the other for up to a day.
