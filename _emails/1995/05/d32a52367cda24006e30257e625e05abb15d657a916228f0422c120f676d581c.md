Birds of a Feather Session on the
Intelligence Community Initiative in
Massive Digital  Data Systems

Held in Conjunction with the 1995 ACM  SIGMOD International Conference on 
Management of Data

in the Crystal Room at The Fairmont Hotel, San Jose, California
on Tuesday, 23 May 1995 from 7:30 pm to 9:30 pm

*******************************

Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS) will require effective management,
retrieval, and integration of databases that may be heterogeneous.  Achieving
this concept of massive intelligence information systems will require new
technologies and novel approaches for data management.  While several advances
have been made in database management technology, the complexity and the size
of the database coupled with the unique needs of the Intelligence Community
(IC) require the development of novel approaches.  The MDDS Initiative has
been started by the  Community Management Staff (CMS) of the IC to identify
the data management issues and challenges as well as to develop possible
solutions for  managing massive databases.,

The purpose of the Birds of a Feather Session is to provide an overview of the
MDDS program, solicit input toward developing a testbed /framework for the 
initiative, and to have  technical discussions  on novel methods for managing
massive databases.  Tentative agenda for the  session is as follows:

1. Overview of MDDS  Initiative 
2. Overview of MDDS  Research Projects 
3.  Discussion on testbed/framework 
4.  Discussion on techniques for massive database management 

Information on the MDDS Initiative can be obtained from :
