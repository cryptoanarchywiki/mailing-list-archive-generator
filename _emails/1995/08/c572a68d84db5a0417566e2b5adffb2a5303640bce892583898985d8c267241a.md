Crapola. They fear the unknown, and read their own personal prejudices 
and beliefs into something they don't understand. Maybe I'll start going 
to church <shudder> and explain to the believers about the benefits of 
crypto *against* such Revalationary measures. I'm sure they would be 
interested in the work Chaum has done regarding truly anonymous 
transactions.
