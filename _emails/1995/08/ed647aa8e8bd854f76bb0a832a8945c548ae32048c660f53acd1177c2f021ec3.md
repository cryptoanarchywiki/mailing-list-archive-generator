   ANNOUNCING: The "MIND YOUR 0WN BUSINESS" audiotext program. 
          1 - 9 0 0 - C A N - M Y 0 B  (1-900-226-6902)
            Notice the zero digit, not the letter "O."

       The Feds say you can't have privacy, but we say you 
                  CAN "Mind Your 0wn Business!" 

And now we have a 900 number to reveal new methods to defend your privacy 
from criminals and tyrants. Sponsored by The Agorist Institute.

The cost of each call is just 99 cents per minute, average cost $2.97, 
average length 3 minutes (August 1995 only. Future messages will be longer.)
You must be at least 18 to call or have parental permission. This is a much 
better deal than you'll get from most psychic or sex lines ;^)

The line will be updated by the 1st of each month. By September 1, 1995, 
our message will be recorded by a professional audio producer, but for now, 
you get to hear me read the first script. Don't be surprised if we update 
it during August.

	Kent
