  Perhaps I wasn't clear... by real-world retaliation, I'm
referring to being sued, thrown in jail, belabored about the
head with blunt objects, etc.  The three basic defenses I have
are: (a) not getting people angry, (b) not letting them know who
to be angry at, or (c) the threat of counter-retaliation.  The
"random" method is of type (b).

  I think you are focusing a bit too much on theoretical
efficiency and not enough on bottom-line practicality.  A 37%
waste factor is better than staying in bed and wasting it all.

Yes, this is currently true, but there was a suggestion of
witholding part of the challenge in order to keep people honest,
or something like that.  I didn't quite understand it, but I
didn't like it.
