Okay, a quick email conversation with Mark Grant as to how one goes
about doing shops via cgi/www, and a brief bit of fiddling, and here
we are:

	http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/sslprize.html

Just click on amount to donate to the pot.  Pay in parts if the amount
you want isn't there (ie 15 c$ = 5 c$ + 10 c$).

cpunks + ecm folks + digicash enthousiasts, accepting your c$
donations now!
