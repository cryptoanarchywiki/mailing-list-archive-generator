That doesn't work under SunOS 4.1.x, but this does:

   date "+%S %M 60 * + %H 3600 * + %j 86400 * + %y 31536000 * + p" | dc

This assumes 365 days/year, so if you jump from a leap year to a non-leap
year it won't work right.  Hey - a 1/1460 failure rate is better
than most Windoze programs I've used ;-)

It also isn't the "absolute" time, (as given by time()), but
gives a number of seconds that constantly increases.
 
With a little more work you should be able to adjust this to be close
to time() functionality.
