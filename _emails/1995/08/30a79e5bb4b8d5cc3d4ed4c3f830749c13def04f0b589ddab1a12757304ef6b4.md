NEWS RELEASE

CHIEF MOOSE TO OPEN 6TH ANNUAL  IACIS TRAINING CONFERENCE

	Chief Charles Moose will deliver the opening remarks at the 6th 
Annual IACIS Training Conference at the Hilton Hotel  in Portland on 
Monday, August 21, 1995 at 10,00 a.m. IACIS is the acronym for the 
International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists, 
headquartered here in Oregon.
	IACIS was founded by Sgt. Tom Seipert of the Portland Police 
Bureau, and specializes in training law enforcement officers in the 
proper methods of seizing computers from criminals, and then extracting 
items of evidence. Computers are the crime scenes of the future, and 
require special training to seize and examine.  The conference will begin 
with a series of mock computer raids on August 21, 1995, and end on 
September 1, 1995, with information on the latest technological changes 
the investigators need to worry about.
	Approximately 150 students will be attending the conference, some 
from as far away as Australia, and the major agencies such as the FBI, 
DEA, Secret Service, IRS Internal Security, and the Georgia Bureau of 
Investigation will be represented.
	For additional information about this conference, and questions 
regarding computer crime investigations, contact Sgt. Tom Seipert at the 
Hilton hotel, 274-4087. He will be at this number Friday August 18th as 
well as Saturday and Sunday, August 19th and 20th.
