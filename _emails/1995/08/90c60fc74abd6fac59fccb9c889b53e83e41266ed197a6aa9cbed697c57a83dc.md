Unfortunatly, this is a wetware being; I did have the pleasure of meeting 
him at a speech given by him and Dave Mandl a few years back.  He did an 
excellent speech, and was very informative.  At the time, being a 
neophite cypherpunk, I found the info enlightening.  But alas, his human 
interaction skills rate below what one would find in a kindergarten.

He's not a bad guy really, just vicious when it comes to manners.  At 
times, he takes the net.cop attitude.  And we all know how well that 
works in an anarchistic organization/group/entity such as the cypherpunks.
He's a great cryptographer/programmer too from what I've seen.

At times, I do respect his skills, but his attitudes belong in /dev/nul.
