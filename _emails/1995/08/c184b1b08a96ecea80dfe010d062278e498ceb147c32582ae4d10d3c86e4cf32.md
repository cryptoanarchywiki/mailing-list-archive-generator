This is old news.  Julius spied, but didn't provide any useful
information. The FBI framed Ethel to try to get Julius to cop a plea
("Sing, or we fry her!")  Julius stuck to his principles, and both Ethel
and Julius were convicted in a rigged trial with a trained seal of J.
Edgar Hoover's as judge.

The Soviets had quality knowledge about the atomic bomb well before
Julius Rosenberg was in a position to pass any information along.  Klaus
Fuchs, the German refugee scientist who was a self-acknowledged
Communist from day one, was in on the most important atomic secret, that
a U235 bomb was practical, from the earliest days of the MAUD Committee,
the wartime British group of physicists that performed the first
calculations and that was the seed of talent around which the Americans'
Manhattan Project coalesced.
