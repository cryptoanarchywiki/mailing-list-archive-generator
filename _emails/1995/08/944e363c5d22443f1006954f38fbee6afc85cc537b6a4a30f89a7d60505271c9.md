In regard to both messages, I think that with sequentially allocated
keyspace an attacker who knows the real key would have trouble getting the
right segment unless s/he grabbed a big enough piece. If the search is
restarted, we know something's up. Ensuring that nobody gets to search
keyspace they searched before would be one improvement. A random (instead
of sequential) allocation _by the keyserver_ (out of unallocated 
piecemeal segments) would also take some work to implement.

If the search wraps around to catch the UNACK'ed pieces, this type of
oversight will only slow down the actual discovery of the key. Failure
to report a found key, though, is a bit different. I would not be opposed
to having my program report possible hits, with the server being what
discovers if I've found it or not.

Why not have a random backup-mode, in case someone does mount a denial of
service attack. Or imploy a combination of the two modes. The machines
running brloop can search sequentially (out of the middle 50%?) and the
machines not connected search randomly (out of the outside 50%?). Or,
venturing further into the I-wonder-who's-gonna-code-this world, log the
random searches for possible conversion to an exhaustive search later. 

It would be nice to be able to hit the emergency button and switch to
random mode, but currently I don't think there's a need to actually
use it.
