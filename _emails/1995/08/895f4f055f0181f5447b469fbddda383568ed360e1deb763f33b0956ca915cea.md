Okay.

The strips that you see in books and on those fake UPC stickers on 
merchandise are NOT magnetic.  They are simply antennas that are tuned
to a particular frequency.

What happens is that when you go near one of the readers/recievers, an 
elecromagnetic (RF) wave is transmitted.  The antenna/sticker is tuned to
this particular frequency and resonates with it.  The result is that there
is a RE-RADIATION of that particular wave and the receiver detects that
out-of-phase retransmitted wave and sets of the alarm.

The deactivator simply raditates a stronger wave (tuned to the same 
frequency) that burns a small fuse on the sticker and changes the length
of the antenna and hence its resonant frequency.

I'm not sure how the book strips work but they are similar.  There has
to be a mechanism in there for resetting some sort of small microelectric
circuit that can be reset and change the length of the antenna.
