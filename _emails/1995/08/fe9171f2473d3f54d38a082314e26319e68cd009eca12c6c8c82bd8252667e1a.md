The "abstract protocol" that works in many economic transactions is simple:
_spot checks_. That is, random samples. You don't have to do all the work
yourself.

"Quality Control" (QC) is based on this. The "Inspected By: Foobar" tags on
manufactured items provided traceability/feedback to a manufacturer--a
reputation system, if you will. Lot numbers, seals, etc.

Yes, this is an obvious point, but it's interesting because the "spot
check" is a kind of protocol that is almost like "cut and choose" in its
crypto connotations.

>Assuming everyone is honest, I am sure many people in businesses

As the Great Leader once said, "Trust, but verify."

There is no reason to make assumptions about honesty: just spot check the
work and downgrade the reputation of anyone who slacks off or is deceitful.

(This "web of distrust," in terms of black marks in reputations, is as
important as the web of trust. The same, really. And yet another reason why
one doesn't want government=root, as they would undoubtedly frown on
anything that was "discriminatory" or "hurtful to the differently abled.")
