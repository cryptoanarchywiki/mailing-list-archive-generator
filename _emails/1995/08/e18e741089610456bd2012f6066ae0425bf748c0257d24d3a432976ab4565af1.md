Just a minor technical comment:
Based on my rather limited experience lurking on the firewalls list, I
believe the preferred security-conscious method of running such daemons
involves _not_ giving them su/root privileges.  Dr. FBC's thttp, for example,
runs as a user named, e.g., "www" with pretty ordinary privileges. They are
also often run in a chroot()ed "jail", so that the process can't see any
directories outside the tree artifically rooted in its home directory. You'd
then need some mechanism for the `rents to submit configuration updates to
the imprisoned daemon, I suppose.  Perhaps digitally-signed email....
