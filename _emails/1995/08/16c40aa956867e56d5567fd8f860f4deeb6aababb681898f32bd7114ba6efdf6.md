He made an announce on the netstuff mailing list a couple of weeks
ago, and also made a statement about the reasons for delays on the
group alt.fan.joel-furr, here's what he said ... (darn it's expired
from news spool), what he said was that he hoped to get the all of the
shirts shipped by the end of this month I think.  Don't quote me on
that cos it's from memory.  But basically his printer moved, causing
1.5 months delay, and he got more orders than anticipated 1500 would
you believe!

Ah... there's more on his current netstuff page:

Should answer your question, A: RSN.
