  That's too low-level to deal with the proliferation of PC sound systems,
especially since even non-intel workstations are adopting PCi buses.
If I recall, /dev/audio relies on u-law/a-law encoding. That's only one
component of a higher level audio system. That's like having a
/dev/svga but no Motif library. Furthermore, a /dev/audio like
interface doesn't admit good hardware acceleration, such as if you
had to play an MPEG layerIII audio, but your sound card had a DSP.
