   "Russian 'in $2.8m Citibank computer fraud'."

      Citibank New York fell victim to a $2.8m fraud after a
      Russian computer hacker penetrated the bank's security
      system in Wall Street and removed the money from the
      accounts of corporate clients, it was claimed in a
      London court yesterday. The alleged fraud was carried
      out by a 24 year-old mathematics graduate using a
      computer in his office in St Petersburg, claim the US
      authorities, which are seeking his extradition from the
      UK.
