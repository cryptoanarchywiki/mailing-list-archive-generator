Has anyone worked out the VCRPLUS code?

The TVGuide has a litsing  which can be used to set up a VCR by
employing a series of numbers which encode date/timestart/timefinish/channel
in a minimized sequence which I believe is a Huffman code(David Huffman-MIT MS
thesis 1954) I am interested in if anyone has taken the time to figure out
the algorithm?
please respond to me directly so as not to clutter the list if you don't mind.
