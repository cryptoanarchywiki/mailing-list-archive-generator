Let us call "sequential search" an algorithm that remembers which keys were
tried and avoids trying them again, and "random search" an algorithm that
just tries keys at random without bothering to check.
 
The sequential search has the following problems:
 
1. The server is badly overloaded.
It is vulnerable to a variety of active attacks:
2. "result hoarding" attacks: finding the result and reporting it "not found".
3. "dilution" attack: allocating some search space and not sweeping it.
4. plain old "denial of service" attack: deliberately overloading the server
   with bogus communications.
5. And of course all of the above in their "buggy software or hardware"
   versions.
 
The random search has none of them:
attacks 1 and 4: there is no server to overload
attacks 2 and 3 are no worse than simply refusing to participate in the search,
because the rest of the computation is independent of what any one party is
doing.
 
The main drawback of the random search is that the expected running "time" is
the size of the key space instead of half the size for the sequential search
("time" here is the number of keys to try before finding the right one).
 
In practice, because of server overload, our machines don't seem to be working
more than half the time, so the random search could be actually faster than
the sequential search.  Even if it isn't, I think doing twice as much work
is a good trade-off for protection against all attacks, and no more network
or server problems, and no more allocation hassles for off-line users.
 
Four more remarks:
* I get the factor of two by assuming that the algorithm is "pick a segment at
  random, look for the key in it, pick a new segment at random, and so on".
  I suspect that sequential searching from a random starting point would be
  much worse in the case of many independent searchers.
* I hope there's no bug in my math.
* Another drawback is that the worst-case running time is infinite (but it is
  infinitely unlikely).
* Of course, we need a good PRNG, but that's essentially what RC4 is.

In conclusion, I think random searching is the way to go.  It's even better
than Monty's pre-allocation with quad-coverage.
