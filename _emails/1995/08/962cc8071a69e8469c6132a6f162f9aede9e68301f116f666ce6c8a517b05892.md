They would not have to include an entire thumbprint.  The actual code used
to verify fingerprints is not very large.  All that would be needed is
enough information to ID into the "official" records and enough checksum
type information to prevent alteration/counterfitting.  Using magnetic media
for this is a bit foolish as it can be changed/destroyed with the stroke of
a magnet.  I will not say by what means I would think should suit as a
better encoding scheme because: 1) They are not using it and 2) I do not
want to give them any ideas.
