This may be the wrong place to pose this question but...
Does anyone have any experience of using the nascent Microsoft Network ? Early 
reports from beta testers say it could be a hackers delight due to the use it 
makes of objects and such like.
Any opinions or does anyone know of any hacks or cracks circulating yet ?
Thanks in advance.
