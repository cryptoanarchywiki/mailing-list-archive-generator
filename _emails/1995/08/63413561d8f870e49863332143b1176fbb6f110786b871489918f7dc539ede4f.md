Problem is, though, if *each* segment is shuffled, or shuffled in groups
of 10 or 25 or 50 or what? brutessl is designed for sequential search
through a block of segments. I was pulling down blocks of up to 40 segments 
each, for each machine I was running. Of course, with brloop running I
won't be in such a bind (I have yet to see that it really works though..)
but still it also represents a coding problem as to handing out sequential
segments within shuffled blocks.

Hey, by the way Piete, is there gonna be a ego list (rankings) like there
was with the RC4?
