Well, lets put it this way, an MP-2 with 16K processors could attack a 56 bit
key about as fast as a 486 could attack a 40 bit key.   The next generation
MP will be less than an order of magnitude faster, although able to use
more processors.

An MP2 with 1K processors can do 220K crypt(3)/sec.  Now, if it weren't so
darned hard to program one for performance...

One tends to wonder if there are analytical methods to reduce the search
space.
