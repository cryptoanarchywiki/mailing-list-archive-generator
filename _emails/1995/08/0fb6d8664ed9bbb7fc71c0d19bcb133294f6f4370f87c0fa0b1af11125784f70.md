Notice how the "over a trillion times more" has devolved into simply "a
trillion times more" -- and we all know that the former statement was a
gross underestimate, reminiscent of the claim of "over 3 billion
combinations" on Ideal's packaging for Rubik's cube.

Of course the real reason the media have standardized on trillian for
this is that they know it is the biggest number the bulk of their
audience is familiar with, and that if they said 3e26 or even "three
times ten to the twenty-sixth power" they would snow most of their
readers/viewers.  (To be fair, I think the WSJ did say 10^26, with a
brief explanation of what that meant.  I congratulate them for not
"talking down" to their readers.)
