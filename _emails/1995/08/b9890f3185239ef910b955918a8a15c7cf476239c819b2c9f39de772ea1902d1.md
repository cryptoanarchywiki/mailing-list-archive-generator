Do you advise using the unabridged Archimedian Sieve to determine if a 
number is prime?

Just feed it ~X as well.

Now we hit an impasse.  I thought the 4-color theorem was considered done 
as well, until a professor of mine contradicted me on this point.  It 
sounds like you might have more current info.  (Mine is 2-3 years old.)

Very restricted, I would think.  Most cases of universalizing would, I'ld 
guess.

That depends on my trust of the human and of the checker.  Frankly, I'ld 
be leary of either.  (And I was told in Algebra that it was 10k+, but the 
point is basically the same.)

This is one of the points that I have pushed on this issue.  Our intution 
on many of these matters is _way_ off until you train it.  And still, 
there are famous cases of failure by trained people.

That's why we go to school.


Okay, on the subject of verifying theorem checkers:

First, you mention some distance into your post, that the theorems being 
checked must be "primitively recursive".  That rather limits you away 
from interesting theorems, wouldn't you say?  In particular, you couldn't 
dream of touching those earlier mentioned biggies.  But that's not all.  
Try the Galois theorems.  Fermat's little theorem?   Barre' catagory 
theorem?  Chinese Remainder Theorem?  Fundamental Theorem of Algebra?  
(In topology, in complex anal, in algebra...)

So I assume that the theorem checkers being deployed aren't limited to 
handling primitively recursive systems.  You now are dealing with a 
rather extensive program.  And proving that a general theorem prover 
works is _not_ something to just sit & do.
