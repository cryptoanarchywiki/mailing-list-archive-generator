Sorry, yet another correction: the G1 box, G[1][i], is parity(i&0x17),
not parity(i) as I said, where parity is 0 or 1 depending on whether its
argument has an even or odd number of 1 bits.  I have checked via a
small program that this is correct and that the earlier formula I
posted for G0 is correct.
