Yes.

I've been told the same thing.  Moreover, I believe the quotation, not 
because of the source of confirmation, but because it fits right into the 
direction most of the intelligence agencies have been taking since the 
revelation that the French had won out a multi-billion $ contract for air 
traffic control because the French service had, through various espionage 
methods, determined the U.S. bidding position and such.

Sorry I can't give attributation for the confirmation.
