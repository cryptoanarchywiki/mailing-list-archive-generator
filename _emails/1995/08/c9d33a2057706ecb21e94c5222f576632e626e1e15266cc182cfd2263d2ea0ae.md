Since various intellectual property debates and questions come up
("plague") periodically, it seemed like it'd be a good idea to post the
following URL:

        http://www.patents.com/

Its run by a small patent law firm and has a series of well-linked, snappy
FAQs on issues pertaining to intellectual property, patents (including some
on "I had a really clever idea--what should[n't] I do?"), relevant links,
etc. etc
