I'm afraid I don't follow. Are you saying that the NSA is assuming a more 
public role because (apparently) stong crypto is now widely available to 
the public? I don't see the connection between A and B if this is what 
you are claiming.

Unless they're gearing up for a PR campaign... I wonder how the NSA has 
been portrayed in Hollywood in the past. I've just seen them mentioned in 
one movie I can think about ("Crimson Tide"). Anyone else know of references?
