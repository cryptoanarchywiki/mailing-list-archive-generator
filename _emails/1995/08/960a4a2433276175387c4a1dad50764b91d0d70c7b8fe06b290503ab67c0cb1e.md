I think the spook-test, to be fair, needs to be based on something
objective, like equipment carried or used. Guns are an easy "yes,"
as are certain listening devices, etc. Others can probably add to
this equipment list, and some of us, considering Mena, might include
drugs or large chunks of cash. I certainly would. <g>

Amen. CIA office locations are much less "secret" in other countries
than they are in the US. Often, a taxi driver knows exactly where the
CIA "safehouses" are in many Latin-American countries.

Yes, but these locations are no-doubt easy for motivated nuts to find.

AGREED!
If it's not, it will fail. "War is the health of the state." [I forget
who said that.] Contra the many raving media accounts, the vast majority 
in the libertarian/"anarchist" movement were and are quite opposed to
the idea of vigilante-murder through bombing Federal buildings full
of mere working stiffs, especially those of us who just happened to
be working in a Federal Building.
