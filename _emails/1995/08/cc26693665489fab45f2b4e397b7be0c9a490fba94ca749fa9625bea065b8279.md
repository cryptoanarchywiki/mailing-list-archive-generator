Joan Feigenbaum, then of Stanford and now of Bell Labs, has worked for many
years on what she calls "computing with encrypted instances."

The canonical example is one where one wishes to send a problem, e.g., a
routing problems a la the Travelling Salesman Problem, to a service for
solving. But one doesn't wish to reveal the cities being considered,
perhaps for business reasons. (The extension of this concern to crypto
should be clear.)

So, one transforms the data set, sends it to the compute services, gets
back and answer, and reverses the transformation.

I've always thought of her work as a kissing cousing to zero knowledge
interactive proof systems, but it evolved along a different path.

A check of her published papers should reveal several summaries. I know
some of her stuff got published in "Crypto Proceedings."
