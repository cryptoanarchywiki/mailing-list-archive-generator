Presumably it's just an error, never attribute to malice what can be
explained by simple error (as the saying goes).

You could falsely ACK keyspace, but it's designed so that it would be
hard to do this by accident, one of the nos is a checksum, which is
trivial to calculate (for a malicious user who cared to read the
source), but 1/65536 of getting it right by accident.

It'll sort itself out tho', because the way Piete Brooks has written
it, when keyspace reaches FFFF, it starts re-assigning the ones which
aren't acked yet, so the 50000 keys will start getting assigned again.
