Why not, she had the right 'assets' for that scene, no? 8-D

Makes sense, too many geeks without a real-world-life out there.

The security was laughable.  But consider that most of corporate Amerika 
is this way.  Very few care about security.  Here at work I have to fight 
extra hard with idiots who log in and leave their machines -- users with 
Supervisory access!  All sorts of shit like that...

Re: ip #'s: Yeah, it's like all the phone numbers in every movie are 
555-xxxx.  Probably they didn't want to get sued by posting a real net 
address and get sued.

That was after she got the milnet address though nice email address that 
can be telnetted into.  But the voice synths are possible.  Apple does 
provide that capability.  You'd have to get the irc client to use it.  
Don't know of any that do off the top of my head but I haven't looked for 
it either.  It wasn't much of a "hot" chat.  It could have been much 
steamier.  The sex content of this movie was pretty lame though...

> (If they all exchange so much e-mail, why do they bother FedExing diskettes?)

More secure to fedex a disk.  Nobody on the net can read what's not on 
the net. ;-)  Now if the author of this movie knew about pgp... totally 
different story.

Yeah, that was quite bad.

That was my impression too.

Yeah, death to MS-Bob...  >:-)

Not unlikely.  A lot of trade shows do provide machines with net access 
as demos of the internet.  Though it's usually manned by the ISP and not 
out in the open.
