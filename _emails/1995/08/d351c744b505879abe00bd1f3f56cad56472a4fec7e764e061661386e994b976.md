I think there are many people who might be willing to use an
"anon CA" should it exist:
	Whistleblowers, perhaps Deep Throat would have used email
	People writing letters to the editor who don't want to trust
		the editor to withhold their info
	People who desire anonymyity yet don't want to trust the gov't
		to certify their communications as authentic/forged
		(Unabomber, Om Shin-rkyo)
	Any number of writers who have used psuedonyms and now want to
		get paid in ecash; Mark Twain?
