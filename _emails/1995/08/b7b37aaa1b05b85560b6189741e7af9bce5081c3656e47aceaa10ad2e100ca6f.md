Unquestionably, it is not possible to block this hole entirely.  However, 
that does not mean that this proposal is not still superior, at least on 
two points.

First, by moving the monitoring software to the ISP, the instalation & 
configuration becomes much easier and more secure for the parent.  The 
monitoring software itself becomes at least as difficult to hack as the 
rest of unix, and the "Hot Babes Watch" hacks at least are prevented.

Secondly, as we move to challenge-response systems, the ability of Jr. to 
forge parental access drops considerably.  The "Last access on" 
information could clue a parent in.  (Jr. could reset the clock before 
modifying programs at home.)


No one on this list is going to claim that a 17-year old who has been 
hacking since he was ten can be stopped.  That doesn't make these efforts 
doomed from the outset, however.  In particular, I want to avoid 
non-custom "solutions" for minors attempting access.
