What I do in Curve Encrypt for the Mac is use the MD5 of the pass phrase,
a 128-bit random salt (overkill is cheap here) and a one-byte counter field
passed repeatedly through MD5, like this:

<bare key> = MD5[<pass phrase>]
<salt> = 128 bits of randoms
<counter> = 0

MD5Init()
for (a tenth of a second)
	MD5Update[<counter><key><salt><key><salt>]
	<counter> = <counter> + 1

<key> = MD5Final()

At startup, the program determines how many iterations of MD5Update can be
accomplished in a tenth of a second on the current CPU, and the loop is run
that many times. The number of iterations and the salt are stored with the
encrypted file, in the clear. The point to the <counter><key><salt><key><salt>
concatenation is that this buffer is 65 bytes long, and MD5 works on 64-bit
blocks, so that the buffer is shifted by one byte in the MD5 block each
iteration, making precomputation of the MD5 addition steps more of a pain.
Also note that the buffer is _not_ repeatedly MD5-hashed, but repeatedly sent
to MD5Update() instead. This is out of fear that there might be fixed-points
in the hash algorithm.
