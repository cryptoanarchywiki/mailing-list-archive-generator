More likely this is a matter of someone assigning a host name to a system
without realizing it has already been taken. Yes it can be a security breech but
as you experienced the connection is broken easily. If someone wanted to grab
your identity they would more likely busy your system (by flooding you with ping
requests or something similar) and then grab you IP address.

The lookup typically goes the other way around, from host--->IP address.
Dependant on the cache hits either address could be returned.
