I think so.  From my understanding, it basically says that, in the
general system, you can write a legitimate expression that expresses its
own illegitimacy, or in other words that the general system is
incomplete "...in the sense that it fails to provide a proof for every
formula which is true under the interpretation..." (quoted from
"Introduction to Metamathematics" by S.C.  Kleene 1952,...,1980)

But I think you misinterpret this.  This does not mean that no program
can be proven to meet any properties.  It means that, among other
things, there are an infinite number of infinite expressions that cannot
be proven, but it does not mean that a finite expression (e.g., a
typical modern program) cannot be proven to meet all sorts of
properties.

In particular, for certain classes of programs, proofs about the flow of
information are not exceedingly complex to establish.  In general (as
was proven in the early 1980s), tracking information flow in a program
is NP-complete, however, in a program designed to limit information flow
this can be very straight forward (in fact I think it may be linear time
and space).  By proving that information doesn't flow from place to
place, we can essentially prove that information in one place does not
affect information in another place (by information thoeory), and
therefore greatly reduce the complexity of demonstrating various things
of particular interest to information security - to wit - that item A
doesn't corrupt item B, and that information in item A is not leaked to
item B.

In the case of the http daemon, it is a relatively small program of less
than 80 lines designed to be secure in various ways.  In the case of PGP
it is a relatively larger program that it not designed to be secure.

How is it fraudulent to accurately state the facts?
