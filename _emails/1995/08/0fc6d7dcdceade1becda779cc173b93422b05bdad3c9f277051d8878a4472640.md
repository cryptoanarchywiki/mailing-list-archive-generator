Sorry about this!  The Windows NT client asked "how many keys" I wanted to
check, not how many key segments.  50,000 sounded like a few seconds' work
on my P120.  I've attempted to return the keys using the "reject" button
(again on the Win32 client), but I don't think it took.  If anyone can tell
me what the quickest way to return these keys is, I'd really appreciate it.

Sorry, all,
Joe Thomas
