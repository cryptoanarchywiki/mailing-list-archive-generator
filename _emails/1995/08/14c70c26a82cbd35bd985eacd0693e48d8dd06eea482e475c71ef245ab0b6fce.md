If a statement is vacuous, it needs refining :-).  If I were to state 
that "Program X is not a Turing Machine", I would be stating that program 
X does not model all Turing machines throught its input.  It is the ability 
of some Turing machines to model all Turing machines through their input 
that makes them undecidable.

The problem here is that it is the interesting cases with which we are 
concerned.  If someone wants to write a computer program to "verify" my 
proof of the RSA algorithm, fine.  But I have to be convinced that there 
program does what they claim before I care.  And since their program 
takes mathematical theorems as input, it is already demonstrating 
near-Turing ( :-P) behavior.

I'll buy that.
