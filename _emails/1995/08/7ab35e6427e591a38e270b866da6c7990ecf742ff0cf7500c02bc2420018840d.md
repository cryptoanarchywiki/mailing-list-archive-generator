I'd prefer to keep the number of segments "lost" if a brloop ceases.

I have written a "local CPU farm" caching server which runs on a robust
machine and grabs chunks from the root server and farms them out to local
machines (running as the same "ID").
This logs all the client transactions so that you can work out if any keys were
allocated to machines which failed to ask for another segment -- you should
assume that that segment was not searched.

With the Big Boys using that, and better code, I hope that server congestion
will not be a problem.

That means that if it crashes, 8 segments are left unACKed :-(
