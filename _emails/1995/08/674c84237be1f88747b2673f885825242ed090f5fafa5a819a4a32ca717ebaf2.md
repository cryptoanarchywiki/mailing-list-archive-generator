After all your griping over PGP, you spout this?  Have you ever heard of 
Godel's theorem?  I have a phrase for people who peddle their mark of 
approval that a given large program will work: "Snake oil salesman".  In 
the messages which you have scrawled between this and the last on my 
system when I caught up this evening, you have demonstrated the 
fraudulent nature of your business by first claiming that certain 
propositions were "demonstrated", then stating that a graduate student 
was working on "proving" them.

I repeat: Snake Oil Salesman
