Today's surf of Netscape's home page yielded an interesting question. Is
Netscape trying to licence links to their products? To me
http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/netscape_now_program.html seems to
suggest tha you can only display certain logos and info if you are
licensed by Netscape. You could for example not put up a link to their
"Download Netscape NOW" page without prior approval by Netscape.

This seems to be a new development on the web. Since when does one need a
license to include certain URLs in one's home page?

Comments?
