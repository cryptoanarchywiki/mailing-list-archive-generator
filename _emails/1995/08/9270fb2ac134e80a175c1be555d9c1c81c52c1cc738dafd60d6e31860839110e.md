   "Esoteric Wedge of Academia Is Roiled by Hunt for Bomber."

      Last October an agent from the Federal Bureau of
      Investigation showed up in New Orleans and subpoenaed
      the History of Science Society's membership records and
      questioned scholars for clues to the identity of the the
      Unabomber. That subpoena, and the disclosure that the
      F.B.I. believes that the bomber is immersed in the most
      radical interpretations of the history of science, has
      roiled the usually placid waters of the discipline. And
      across the country, professors have begun reconsidering
      old suspicions, acquaintances and tracts to help solve
      the crimes.                                    ROL_aid


   "Obscure Global Bank Moves Into the Light."

      In a small Swiss city sits an international organization
      so obscure and secretive that for many years visitors
      got lost looking for a small plaque next to an otherwise
      undistinguished doorway. Control of the institution, the
      Bank for International Settlements, lies with some of
      the world's most powerful and least visible men: the
      heads of 32 central banks, officials able to shift
      billions of dollars and alter the course of economies at
      the stroke of a pen. Now, however, the bank is stepping
      out of the shadows a bit. Last September, the Federal
      Reserve, the United States' central bank, officially
      joined -- quietly and discreetly, of course.   DON_ask
