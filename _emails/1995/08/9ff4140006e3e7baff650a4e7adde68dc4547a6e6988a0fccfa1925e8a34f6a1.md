Believe it or not, something like this is being used (or is being prepared
for use) in breast implants.  An article in the Houston (silicone city)
Chronicle about a month ago (sorry, I can't produce a more exact reference)
stated that new soybean oil breast implants are being manufactured to
accept an identification device to track information on the patient and the
implanting doctor.

It's not exactly big brother (bigger sister?) but it's the first
human-implanted ID device that I've heard of.  I don't know if any have
actually been implanted.
