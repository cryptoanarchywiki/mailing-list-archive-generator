... and maybe based on a false premis ?

Correct.

NO.

The load was very *LOW*.
The problem was that the single threaded server was spending most of its time
talking to clients which failed to complete their interactions, and timed out.
The earlier client "ACK" code didn't hang around long enough, and gave up.
Later code kept trying ....

Nope -- basic fault here !! TCP not UDP !!

Not the case.
It uses a reliable bytestream, and the client does not consider a keyspace
ACKed until it get back the "OK" response from the server.
This makes it "at least once", but that isn't a problem.

It does, in the reliable bytestream ...

As above -- "at least once" -- it just retries.

brclient waits a bit and tries again, before asking for the next.

Nah.
