I am not saying it is so I am just speculating

Windows ?

Microcode of big host systems like the one from IBM?

Each mainframe comes with a line attached. Customer
typically don't have the faintest idea what is going on 
that line. I know one customer who stuck a printer 
there and though - now we will see ... well he ended
up with printouts he did not have the faintest idea
of their context.

Now does anyone has real evidence of possible
backdoors?

Best Regards
