Well, imagine my suprise  ....  [[ reference to ISIRTA ]]

One of the things that the latest brloop does is make a call to the master
server asking for a list of servers to contact :-))

Note that it is a list, and it tries them in order (all A RRs).

Currently just all the "allocate" transactions -- I haven't written my
ACK reflector yet, so all ACKs go direct th the ACK master.

> The slaves would each be delegated large chunks of the keyspace,

No -- the slaves will not "be delegated" (as in pre-assigned address space),
they will just ask the master for it as they need it.
Sure, the'll do it in reasonable sized chunks, but not (2**16)/16 ....

Nah - results still go direct pro tem.

Sure.

You got it !

Yup -- code sharing !

Well, not even that !

The slaves don't have the config file with the key info in it ...

Indeed.

BUT ....

These cache servers are asking for non trivial amounts of keyspace.
As such there should not be *too* many, and then need to be "managed" ...
If one crashes, the logs need to be scanned to see how to restart it (so that
it starts by doling out the segments that it had no sub-doled to its clients).

> A slave doesn't care whether a slave or a brute talks to it.

Indeed -- that's how it was designed ...

However, note that with big cache servers (as opposed to Local CPU Farm servers
where all clients are the same "ID") reports of sub-allocation have to be
passed back to the root :-(

Indeed -- the Local CPU Farm cache server is just about ready for ALPHA testers

Done ...

Yeah -- but being based on C, C++ didn't stand much chance ...

... but better than C++ -- sure.


PS1: PERL gurus: Anyone know how to test whether there is input waiting on a
     file handle ? I know about seeing if there is data waiting for the next
     sysread type read, but not on the next <SERVE> type read. Ideas ?

PS2: PERL gurus: I fixed the SGI Challenge problem by HACKing it -- as I
     thought it was a probleb with stdio in and out on the same socket.
     The perl mand page warns:
	If  your  stdio  requires an seek or eof between reads and
	writes on  a  particular  stream,  so  does  perl.   (This
	doesn't apply to sysread() and syswrite().)
     so I change the one "print SERVE" line to a "syswrite(SERVE" and that
     fixed it. However, does anyone know the "correct" way to use stdio for I/O?

PS3: I'd like to get the raw date in brloop (a sh script). In perl I'd just
     use "time", and I can't see a way to get "date +" to yield the raw time.
     I could use "date=`perl -e 'print time'`" but that seems OTT, and perl
     may not be on teh users PATH. Any suggestions ?
