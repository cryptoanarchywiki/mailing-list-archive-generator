You wouldn't want them to get *dusty*, Tim. Why not embed them in something
like epoxy, better, Lexan, to protect them from the elements? Say about a
foot thick in all directions... Should make sure the media itself is
sufficiently coated too. Don't want the little electrons getting hurt, you
know...

I see a market opportunity here. Time to buy DuPont stock. I hear it's been
depressed lately.
