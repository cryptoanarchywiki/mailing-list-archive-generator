> other organisations allowed to use strong crypto. 
> 
> Centralising the wiretap capability with the AG is represented as a useful

> Centralisation will enable the AG to acquire the capability to use ``more

> Curiously enough, he quotes a `Review of long Term Cost Effectiveness

> as a problem for TI at present in Australia'' and goes on to say that
> ``there has been comparatively little market for voice encryption 
> products, although they have been readily available''.

> He even produces some good arguments for the EFF, such as that much of
> the intelligence comes from the call log data and from calls to third 
> parties such as airlines and hotels which are not encrypted.

> He also says that the OECD countries will hold a meeting on National 
> Cryptography Policies later this year. While at the conference, I found

> Australia and South Africa, at which the assembled spooks agreed to
