You hit the nail right on the head when you said:
	"or they are extremely limited in what they can do"

That's exactly the point.  We cannot prove programs with general purpose
functionality to be secure, becasue they are not.  But we may well be
able to prove a lot of security properties about programs that are not
general purpose.  For example, a Web server that only does GET and a
gopher server (not gopher plus) and a mail server may all fit the bill. 
An by coincidence, these are exactly the sorts of programs we want to be
able to prove security properties about.

I think in the case of simple (i.e.  short and written for the purpose)
programs these proofs could reasonably be done by hand.  In fact, I
think we could create a theorum verifier that we could prove to only
verify true theorums as true.  Some theorums would never be proven one
way or the other, and others might be proven false, but some things,
particularly the ones we need to bootstrap the theorum proof technology
and things like the properties of a secure W3 server, could fit intop this
schema.

Not in the case of programs like the secure W3 and Gopher servers.  They
are under 100 lines long.  They are also designed to allow easy proof of
the desired properties.

But this is only true for certain classes of systems.  By designing other
classes of systems explicitly designed to not have those properties, we can
build up substantial systems with demonstrable protection properties.

I thionk you should reopen your thinking.
