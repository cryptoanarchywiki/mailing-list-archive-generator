Keep down, I guess you meant.

I agree that is the best policy -- it fails safe -- but I still think the
prefetching of some more segments would be useful.  The goal is to suck up
as many idle cycles as is practical.

And if it had grabbed 8 segments to begin with and crashed, it still
would have been 8 segments left unACKed.

Plus, it's only 8 segments unACKed if it crashes before it finished that
last segment, since it will start trying to ACK the first four segments
when it finishes the fourth -- at the same time starting on the next
four segments.

Would you see it any differently if I had said, "For instance, if it has
two segments allocated and it is halfway through the second segment, it
should request two more segments *while* it is scanning the last segment"?

Keeping in mind that it will still ACK the first bunch of segments when
it finishes them.
