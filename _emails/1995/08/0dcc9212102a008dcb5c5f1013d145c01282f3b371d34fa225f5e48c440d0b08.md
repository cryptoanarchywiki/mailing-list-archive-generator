The computer which controls the engine checks whether there is a transponder
in the ignition key. The key sends a 32 bit ID number. If this number was
registered in the computer, the engine works, otherwise not. You can't start
the engine just by shortcutting some wires.

[ This should have been "than having him...". I was very tired yesterday
 evening. It's embarrassing to see how many typos I made :-( ]

No, the theft detectors don't. But they are big and unsuspicious enough to
hide specific detectors for big brothers...

Why implausible? Stores cooperate. I know about a big department store in 
Germany (but I don't tell you which one) which has a large secret military
hospital and a medical stock below it's basement. None of the employees
knows about. If they cooperate in having a complete hospital inside, why
shouldn't they cooperate in having some antennas and some wires?
