It may have "opened" at $28, but the first bid was $71 and now it's trading  
at $50something.  Not quite so spectacular as at first glance...  So unless  
you shorted it or were an insider it wasn't such a hot thing (so far).   
Quarterdeck is probably a better buy.

ob crypto:  the "top secret" source just posted looks interesting... 64-bit  
blocks, 80-bit keys, 32 rounds hmmmm....
