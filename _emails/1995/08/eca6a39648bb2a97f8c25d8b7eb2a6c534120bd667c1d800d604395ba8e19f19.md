I use PGP on every outgoing message and about 20% of incoming messages.  And
I send/receive a *lot* of messages.  No way I would be able to do a process 
like the above on my mail.


In a few weeks I will be able to get mail on my home computer, but most
(80%?) Internet users will still not have that luxury.

In my opinion it *is* worth the risk.  I believe that having "BEGIN PGP
SIGNED MESSAGE" in your posts and e-mail is a social good (raising public
awareness of/acceptance of PGP) which is more important than actually
protecting my e-mail from spying/forgery.


>  Besides, how often do you need to use it?  


Public awareness/acceptance, traffic analysis, the "electronic envelope" 
analogy...


If you don't use it, it's not doing any good at all.


Regards,

Bryce
