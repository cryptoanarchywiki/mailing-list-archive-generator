A reasonable approach, but be careful in your implementation.
I haven't seen the book "A Million Wimpy Passwords and their MD5s" yet,
but the CD-ROM version may be out soon :-)  And you can probably
ftp it from dockmaster.

IVs are designed to let you put random stuff in them to discourage
known-plaintext attacks, replay attacks, etc.   However, suppose you
take a known 64 bits from MD5(password) and put them in the IV -
instead of the Bad Guy needing to brute-force 168-bit-deep Triple DES,
he gets to brute force MD5s of human-selected passwords instead,
which makes a lot of pre-computation possible.

Also, for 3-Key Triple-DES, how do you get 168 bits of key from
128bits of MD5?  (for 2-Key 3-DES, you only need 112 bits...)
If you do something like M1=MD5(Key), M2=MD5(M1,Key), realize 
you've got at most 128 bits of real key instead of 168, 
though that probably needn't worry you too much...

Won't hurt, as long as you remember to remove it on the decrypt-end.

Put the strong random number in the IV, if you've _got_ a source
of strong random numbers...

You might want to do something fancy like choose a random salt,
use the salt for the IV, and use MD5(salt,human-selected-key) for the key.
This makes pre-computation much less useful (unless you're careless
and use MD5(key,salt) instead if MD5(salt,key)...), and means that
you use a different session key for each batch of stuff you encrypt,
even though you're using the same key.  If you're paranoid about replay
attacks, you could let some of the bits of the salt be random and some 
be a counter, and never accept a key smaller than the one from the
previous successfully-decrypted message.
