The fact that it uses exactly 5 *'s, and the MACB E command below indicate 
this was probably an Anarchie transcript, a ftp/archie client for the Mac.

Too bad "Anonymous" isn't more aware of the FTP protocol.  This indicates that 
the connection was made from 199.117.100.36, p36.Boulder-2.dialup.csn.net.

This indicates "Anonymous" is either making up everything from this point on, 
or has access to the machine other than normal anonymous FTP.  The permissions 
on dist would prevent the CWD from happening.  Actually, the permissions on 
dist prevent this from working at all.

Look, if you want to make PGPfone available overseas in violation of ITAR, go 
ahead.  It's a stupid law, and you aren't likely to get caught.  But don't 
make MIT or Phil the fall guy for it.  Send it out yourself.  MIT and Phil 
have contributed greatly to the privacy community, and stupid stunts like this 
aren't going to encourage them much.
