   8-8-95. NYPaper (for paleo-galactic quackers):


   "New Survey of Sky Finds Most Quasars Are Equally Ancient:
   The strange objects may be an early stage of galaxy
   formation."

      The discovery of new evidence for the epoch of quasar
      proliferation was one of the important results of a
      10-year survey of quasars conducted by astronomers using
      the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory in
      southern California. The findings were reported in the
      July issue of The Astronomical Journal by Dr. Maarten
      Schmidt of the California Institute of Technology, Dr.
      Donald P. Schneider of Pennsylvania State University and
      Dr. James E. Gunn of Princeton University. Other
      astronomers praised the research and noted that it
      generally confirmed the results of a complementary
      survey of the southern sky by a team led by Dr. Patrick
      Osmer, an astronomer at Ohio State University. Those
      observations, reported last year, were conducted at
      telescopes in Australia and Chile.
