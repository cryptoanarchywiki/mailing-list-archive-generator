History shows that your approach fails. Here are some examples:

	Tens of thousands of people had source to the http daemon from
	CERN, and yet none of them noticed a hole that was detected as
	it was being exploited only a few months ago. 

	Tens of thousands of people have access to sendmail and yet
	new holes are found by attackers several times per year on
	average.

	Tens of thousands of people have access to the sources of
	various versions of hundreds of software packages, yet there
	are holes found every day.

Request for Comments: 1750 - Randomness Recommendations for Security

"...Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated
adversary is surprisingly difficult.  ...recommends the use of truly
random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware on many
systems can be used for this purpose."

PGP does not use "truly random hardware techniques"

"...For the present, the lack of generally available facilities for
generating such unpredictable numbers is an open wound in the design of
cryptographic software.  ...  the only safe strategy so far has been to
force the local installation to supply a suitable routine to generate
random numbers.  To say the least, this is an awkward, error-prone and
unpalatable solution." - 1994 - after PGP was implemented.

and then: "This informational document suggests techniques for producing
random quantities that will be resistant to such attack.  It recommends
that future systems include hardware random number generation or provide
access to existing hardware that can be used for this purpose."

"...Systems like Kerberos, PEM, PGP, etc.  are maturing and becoming a
part of the network landscape [PEM].  These systems provide substantial
protection against snooping and spoofing.  However, there is a potential
flaw.  At the heart of all cryptographic systems is the generation of
secret, unguessable (i.e., random) numbers. "

(Internet RFCs are searchable at http://all.net)

So I guess the RFC supports my contention and not yours.

You might be, but even if you are not, that doesn't mean there are no
back doors.  Your inability to detect a backdoor gives me little
confidence, since this is at least an NP-complete problem and, with all
due respect, today, nobody can prove that PGP is free of backdoors

But the RFC acknowledges that these methods are highly suspect and should
not be trusted.
