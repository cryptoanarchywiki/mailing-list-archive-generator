Back in CT they have mag strips and holograms on the drivers license, but
they aren't taking full advantage last I checked (about 8 months ago, when
I was last in CT).

Anyway, once an enterprising c'punk cracks the code, whats to stop people
from putting more interesting info on the strips? Or possibly a virus? Is
it conceivable? And if there is enough room on there for personal info, why
not wipe the data that's there and put your PGPKey there. And when Officer
Opie asks "What happened to your info and why's it all scrambled?" an
innocent "I dunno" would have to suffice....

Just my 0.02...
