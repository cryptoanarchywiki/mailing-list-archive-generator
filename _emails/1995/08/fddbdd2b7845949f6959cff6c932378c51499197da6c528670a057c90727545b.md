There is no need to revoke the old key - you just create a new key with
both the old and new keys and send it to the KeyServer. The normal PGP
"Default" when there are more than one key with the same Email Address is
to use the last one (which would be last in the keyring as well as have the
latest date). By leaving the old key as NOT revoked it can still be used
but will tend to be replaced by the new longer key as people get your key
from the Server.

If you DO want to revoke the old key, you just send the Revocation
Certificate to the KeyServer along with the new longer key (but note that
then, I think you will not be able to decode messages sent with the old
key).
