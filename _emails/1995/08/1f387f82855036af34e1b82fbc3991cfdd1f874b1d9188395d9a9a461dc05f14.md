You left out Mr. Perot, who has a pench
nt for investigation [and even
"operations" ] with his own family, business & money, and has not ruled
out another run for the presidency this time.

Imagine this authoritarian statist in charge of the whole alphabet
of U.S. intelligence agencies run by *tax* money...
Chilling! [I would ordinarily make an "all ears" joke now.] <g>

...

On another subject, NPR announcement confirmed at 6:38AM today.
Key "escrow" with a private company [exact qualifications undefined,
but amenable to service of search warrants] but export of stronger
crypto now permitted. No U.S. key escrow for unexported cryptography
[yet]. <sigh>

own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he
contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous
structures of reality. It is enough if one merely tries to comprehend
a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity."
