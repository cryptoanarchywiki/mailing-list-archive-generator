The second edition to APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY will be published in November.

This is not just a correction, it is a major update.  There are 50% more
words in the second edition.

The second edition will be published in both hardback and paperback.  Wiley
is jacking the price a bit, so I am offering a 15% pre-publication discount.
Details will be forthcoming when I invent them.

Attached is the table of contents.
