This is all well and good, for ciphergroupies, BUT WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO
WITH CODING IN C?

:-}

Seriously, I've read (or used as a reference) Richelson's books. His book
on U.S. Intelligence Agencies had a lot of good stuff on the more obscure
agencies, and is a great supplement to Bamford.

At least some cryptographers think this stuff is useful, as Whit D.
borrowed my copy for several months.

I look forward to getting this new one!
