It depends how it is packaged to the voter, if it is even presented at
all (as you note below so much gets quitely swept through, and
presented fait-a-compli once they've already signed some euro deal).

The US at least makes a token of having public debate, I wouldn't be
suprised to see little to no coverage of this in the UK for instance.
If it was worded as 'government wants to force taps on all your
phones' as presumably the clipper vote was, then you might get a
reaction, but if it's worded as a way to keep tabs on all those evil
child pornagraphs who teem in the countless millions on the internet,
well it's not so eady to convince people.  Some folks still have a
mistaken belief that because that nice police man says that we need to
do this to protect our children then it is so.

Also note that Clipper wasn't completely quashed, Clinton elected to
use it for government contractors, and government official business
where crypto would be used, by presidential decree.  Not a very
democratic move, and still a ploy to get the thing accepted by
misspent government money in creating a market for the things, and
mandating it's use in defense contracting work for the government.

Sure that's exactly the approach taken to ram these things down our
throats with out public debate.

Civil disobedience is a nice way to protest obvious nonsense, of
course, but doesn't help financial institutions who will be by law
required to use escrowed encryption with the AU govt holding the keys
(in the case of the AU example government current line).  Where's your
privacy then?  You must fight for it, whilst your very efforts are
illegal, and these ludicrous laws can then be selectively enforced
depending on the whims of some arbitrary power.

Liveable, as you could view it as a 'freedom tax', but unjust.

Well there's several issues: should they be allowed to do this (no
way), and will they get away with it in the current level of crypto
awareness (probably IMO), and will it be an effective deterrant
(depends, the US one seems to keep US companies out of crypto, even
though it has probably aided rather than hindered PGPs popularity),
and is it enforceable (well ultimately no, due to good stego - your
'SuperStego for Windows' v 7.3b).

If you're confidence in Swedens resistance to big brotheresque crypto
regs is justified, well perhaps a bevy of political thought criminals
will come live in Sweden to escape their own repressive regimes.  Hows
the job market for unix hackers?
