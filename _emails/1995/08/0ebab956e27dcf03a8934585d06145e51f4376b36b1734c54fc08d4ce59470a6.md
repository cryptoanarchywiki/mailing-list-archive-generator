When I originally volunteered to help with coding on the PGP voice stuff,
the author (I think) of Nautilus sent me, and the rest of the PGP voice
mailing list participants, version 0.2 for review.  The initial plan was
to take the Nautilus code, rewrite it in a more modular fashion, and add
encryption to create voice PGP.  However, the incarnation of the PGP voice
mailing list we were using for the project just died, and I heard nothing
more about Nautilus after I submitted my comments and suggestions -- until
the release of Nautilus 0.9.

So if Nautilus code was not used in PGPfone, I suspect licensing or other
such issues got in the way, and Will Price and crew started from a
different base. Then again, perhaps Nautilus and PGPfone have much in
common.  We'll have to wait for the PGPfone release for the answer.
