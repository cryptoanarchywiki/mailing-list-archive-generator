Well, the only real issue is that the requestor *not* be able to
reliably predict which segments will be assigned.  The server may adopt
a strategy of picking a random block of segments for each request.
This introduces a certain amount of fragmentation into the process, but
there are strategies to minimize this.  It may be enough to break up
keyspace into, say, 32 "regions", and fill requests sequentially, but
from a randomly selected region.
