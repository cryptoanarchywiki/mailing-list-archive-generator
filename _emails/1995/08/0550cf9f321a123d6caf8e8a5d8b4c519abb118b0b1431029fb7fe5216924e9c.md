I understand what you mean, although *my* primary interest is 
techno-enthusiasm and near-future sociological speculation.  :-)

I'm afraid these words will turn out to be prophetic.  On the other hand, the
nature of this market is such that the industry leadership can turn-over
quickly.  I expect that the factor which has the most inertia in this game is
consumer mind-share.  The other factors-- capital, technology, skilled labor,
publicity-- can all be quickly gained by any aggressive new start-up that
wants them.

According to Steven Levy (in his Wired mag story on David Chaum), Chaum
refuses to make deals with companies that would cut corners on his privacy
provisions.  I don't know how accurate that story is, but if it is true it
would explain why DigiCash is the technological leader and the marketplace 
dark horse.


(Hm.  "DC" -- "DigiCash" -- "David Chaum".  I just noticed that...)
