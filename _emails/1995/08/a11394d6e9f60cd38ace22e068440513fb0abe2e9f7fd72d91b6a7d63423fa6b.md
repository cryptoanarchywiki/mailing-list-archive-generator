Probably for the next month or so since IPSEC implementations aren't
out. (Well, actually, Morningstar is already reportedly offering them
to selected test customers but that might not be true -- in any case
they can't export.) swIPe won't do what you want out of the box
anyway, though.

Doubtful, but I believe swIPe is on overseas sites already.

None you care to use.
