For Java to reach its full potential, I think it is absolutelly essential
that applets have the ability to securely and reliably store information
for long periods of time. In the long term, this means creating remote
applet accessible datahavens. But as a temporary hack, before clean code
supporting such services becomes available, very limited local file access
is cleary the way to go. This is an important _feature_ that will enable
some truly complex services as the class libraries matures, not a bug.
