This was, of course, originally one long line:

date +"%S %M 60 * + %H 3600 * + %j 1 - 86400 * + %y 70 - 31536000 * + %y 
69 - 4 / 86400 * + 3600 4 * + p" |dc

Differences: %j 1 -, because days of the year are numbered from 1, not
zero, and we don't want to count 86400 seconds for today before today
has finished.

%y 70 -, because 1970 is the epoch, of course.

%y 69 - 4 / 86400 * +, takes into account all leap days in all leap years
up through last year.  Why?  Left as an exercise for the reader.  ;-)

3600 4 * +, this is a bit of ugliness.  date +%s returns GMT for me.
I'm in EDT, so that's four hours away from GMT.  So this is necessary to
make this return the same number as date +%s.  But if you're in another
time zone, you need to change that 4 above appropriately.  If this whole
section is deleted we are left with:

date +"%S %M 60 * + %H 3600 * + %j 1 - 86400 * + %y 70 - 31536000 * + %y
69 - 4 / 86400 * + p" |dc

which returns local time, which is probably what you wanted anyway.

By the way, date --version, on my system, returns "GNU shellutils 1.9.4",
just in case you were wondering what date I'm using.
