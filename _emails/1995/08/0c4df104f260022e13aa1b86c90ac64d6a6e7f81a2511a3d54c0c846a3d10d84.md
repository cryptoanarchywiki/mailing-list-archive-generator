Most credit card companies ship their registration information off shore to
low tech developing countries. The idea is that the people entering the
information are unlikely to be able to exploit the information they are
exposed to.

Capturing a set of credit card tapes is certainly profitable, as would be
capturing large volumes of numbers, as you suggest. Now, are those West
African credit fraud rings dialing up DEC, SUN, and SGI? :-)

P.S. There could be an article in tomorrows WSJ about the SSL Challenge.
The technical details and facts will surely be mangled. :-(
