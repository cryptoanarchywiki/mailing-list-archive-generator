   Eye-catching quote in the Info Week story on Internet theft:


   Another threat is the growing number of information brokers
   who use online communications to match buyers and sellers.
   An increasing number of these brokers -- many of whom are
   former government intelligence employees in the United
   States and Eastern Europe -- work closely with hackers
   dealing in illicit data.

   "The biggest security problem organizations face today is
   information brokers," says Dan White, national director of
   information security at Ernst & Young in Chicago. "Since
   the end of the Cold War there have been a lot of people
   trained in espionage who don't have a lot to do."
