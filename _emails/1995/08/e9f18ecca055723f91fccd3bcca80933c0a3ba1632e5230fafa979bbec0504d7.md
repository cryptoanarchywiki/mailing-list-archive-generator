I had a similar report before, and it turned out to be an over zealous WWW 
"cache" :-((

HOWEVER: there is now a new brclient 0.17 which should go faster that pre 0.16 
over "slow" links, but shoudl also work over "fast" links (which 0.16 
sometimes did not).  SO: all 0.16 users should upgrade, just in case the link 
goes fast!
