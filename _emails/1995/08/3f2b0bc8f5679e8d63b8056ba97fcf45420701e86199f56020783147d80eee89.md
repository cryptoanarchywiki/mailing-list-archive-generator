Don Eastlake has actually done a draft RFC on
using the DNS for key distribution.

It may be found at 

ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnssec-secext-04.txt

He briefed the W3C security working group about
this recently, and a number of people raised objections, notably

* database bloat
* zone transfer bloat
* increased hits on root servers due to a new class of inquiry.

There was some discussion as to whether these were valid objections,
and the people running prototype code said they had had no problems.
