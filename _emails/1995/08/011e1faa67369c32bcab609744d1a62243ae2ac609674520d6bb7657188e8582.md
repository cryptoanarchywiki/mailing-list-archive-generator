ANNOUNCE:- RSAEURO Version 1.00
===============================

What is RSAEURO?
----------------

RSAEURO is a cryptographic toolkit providing various functions for the use
of digital signatures, data encryption and supporting areas (PEM 
encoding, random number generation etc).  To aid compatibility with 
existing software, RSAEURO is call-compatible with RSADSI's "RSAREF(tm)" 
toolkit. RSAEURO allows non-US residents to make use of much of the 
cryptographic software previously only (legally) available in the US.

RSAEURO contains support for the following:

*    RSA encryption, decryption and key generation.  Compatible with 'RSA
     Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #1.

*    Generation and verification of message digests using MD2, MD4, MD5 and
     SHS (SHS currently not implemented in higher-level functions to
     maintain compatibility with PKCS).

*    DES encryption and decryption using CBC (1, 2 or 3 keys using
     Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt) and DESX(tm), RSADSI's secure DES
     enhancement.

*    Diffie-Hellman key agreement as defined in PKCS #3.

*    PEM support support for RFC 1421 encoded ASCII data with all main
     functions.

*    Key routines implemented in assembler for speed (80386 and 680x0
     currently supported).

International Use
-----------------

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  Please do not distribute or use this software in the
US   it is 'illegal' to use this toolkit in the US, as PKP have a patent 
to public-key cryptography.  If you are a US resident, please use the 
RSAREF toolkit instead.
