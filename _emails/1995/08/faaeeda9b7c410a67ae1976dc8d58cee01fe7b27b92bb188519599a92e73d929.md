What are some of the more common "coincidences" and non-random
correlations that ordinary random number generators (ones found in
common computer languages that don't take extensive measures to be
random) have?

It seems that there's a lot of fuss about getting very random numbers,
but unless the numbers produced by ordinary measures have very obvious
coincidences, maybe it's a big fuss about nothing...?
