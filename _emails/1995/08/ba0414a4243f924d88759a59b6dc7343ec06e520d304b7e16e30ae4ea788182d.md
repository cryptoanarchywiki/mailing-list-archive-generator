Definitely. Is there an easy way to get from the 29 to the 8?  I can see how
it goes
the other way, but what I didnt' see was how, if given 29, I could get the
8? (Euclid's?)

Ok.  I wasn't thinking of multiplicative inverse when doing this--I guess I
wasn't in the right frame of mind.

I'll take the course, but you still needn't be so swarmy about it.
