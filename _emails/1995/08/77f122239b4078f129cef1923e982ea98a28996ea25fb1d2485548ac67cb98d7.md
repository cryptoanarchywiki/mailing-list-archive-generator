In high school I was in JROTC and was put in charge of security for our
batallion. I read the army's guides to physical security. These books
were dated early 80's and late 70's, so the situation might have changed, 
but I doubt it. They denoted three information security clearance levels.
CLASSIFIED, SECRET, and TOP SECRET. If TOP SECRET doesn't exist now, it
definately did just a few years ago.
