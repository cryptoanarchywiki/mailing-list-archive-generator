But the scammer who has done his or her math homework will recognize
that it's reasonably unlikely that his or her assigned range contains
the true key (depending, of course, on the size of the assigned
range...).  Thus, on the average, if everyone gets paid, a scammer
will make money by not actually searching the range assigned (perhaps
actually using the CPU time on a different key search).

I think it'd also be important to reward those who throw more compute
power at the task more than those who just sic a desktop on the job.
This is handled elegantly by the first method -- the person who
dedicates some giant supercomputer to the task is that much more
likely to find the key and be rewarded...
