Believe it or not, Co$ has just struck again!

I just talked with Lawrence Wollersheim of FACTNet in Golden, Colorado. As
I type (10:20 a.m. PDT), Federal marshals are looking on as Co$ goons grab
all of FACTNet's computers, records, archives, and on and on.

Look for more information shortly.

Please post this EVERYWHERE. Get the word out!

A special note to T.C. May:

These are nice people, eh. Three raids for posting unsealed court 
documents. Get a clue Tim!
