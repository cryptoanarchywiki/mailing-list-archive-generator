AFAIK (my 4 lines might differ from yours), there is no PRNG in the
4 lines of perl. The key is supplied as a parameter, and no guidance
to its generation is given in the implementation.

You are right about the dc, but it only uses that for modular exponentiation,
which is a lot easier to prove correct than PRNG.
Which is not to say that it *has* been proven.


I guess that makes me a nit-picker...
