The relevant verses are in Revelations 13, where some of the actions
by which The Beast can be recognized are given. Among them are:

16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and 
   bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or 
   the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

Millenialist Christians tend to regard this as a method by which 
the faithful will be shut out of the economy, since the pious will
refuse such a 'mark'.

E-cash is a bit of a reach from this, but some of them (eg, 
Robertson), extend the verses to cover all forms of trackable 
transactions. I suspect that if someone could get him to realize the 
privacy aspects of true anonymous ecash, he'd like it.

Just don't propose an implantable cryptographic token :-).
