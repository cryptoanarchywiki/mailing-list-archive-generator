Since messages sent with netscape are fairly standard for the first so
many bytes, why not make a 2^30 element table, store it on a few
gigabytes of disk space, use a hash table on the message, and find the
keys to one in every 1,000 messages about 1 time per second.  If this
code is being used to send millions of credit transactions per day, we
should be able decode thousands of credit card numbers per day for a
one-time cost of about $5,00.

The $10,000 estimate of the cost of computing time is far too high
for a production-based attack on the netscape codes.
