Foo.  Unix used to work just fine in 64K+64K split I&D space on a PDP-11 :-)
It got bigger when lots of stuff was added, especially networking and 
X windows, and I wouldn't want to go back to small machines.  

However, during one such discussion on comp.unix.wizards or wherever,
Dennis Ritchie posted a nice article about "Mine is smaller than yours",
saying "here's how big my OS is" (I think ~250K, and the OS was 8th or 9th
Edition),
"telnet over to foovax, it's this big", "datakit over to barmips, it's that
big",
"some other networking method over to some other machine, it's that big",
"yet another protocol over to yet another bigger machine", 
"display size of the operating systems on my 256K Blit and Gnot terminal, etc.

And QNX's kernel fits just fine inside the cache on a 486,
though it wouldn't actually stay there much.
