First, (and not really related to this mailing list) is an article by
Arnold Kling explaining why Netscape stock was so popular, and why
people who purchased stock in the first couple of hours are now
$13/share in the hole.  (stock opened at $71, declined to $53ish, and
now hovers at $58ish)   He also explains where he thinks the price will go.

Second, Pat Robertson's "The 700 Club" now has a WWW site and on it he
advertises a new video tape http://the700club.org/cbn/telethon.html
where he predicts the end of the world.  What has that got to do with
"www-buyinfo"?  Well, one segment is described as:
        "This story examines the oncoming rush to digital cash [...]
        and how quickly businesses, financial institutions, and even
        the government are moving in this direction."
For those of you without a copy of Revelations handy, this is a Mark
Of The Beast according to him.  You'll have to buy the video to find
out why.  Revelations is on-line (along with the whole bible) at:
        http://www.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?&passage=Revelation


Sorry for the almost completely non-technical post.

Have a good weekend, y'all!
