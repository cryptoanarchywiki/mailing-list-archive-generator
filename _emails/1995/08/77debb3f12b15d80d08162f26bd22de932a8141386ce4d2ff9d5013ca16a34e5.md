   PRZ is awarded a 1995 Chrysler Award for Innovation in
   Design, says a $40,000 full-page ad in The NYT today, with
   a brief citation:

      Philip Zimmermann is the designer of Pretty Good Privacy
      (PGP), an E-mail encryption software. Thanks to the
      algorithms of PGP, which was released to the public as
      free software in 1991, E-mail messages can be sent
      securely all over the world without the risk of
      interception by any third party.

   No mention of the free-world leader's sword poised to
   decapitalize the public-spirited designer to protect IC
   hegemony.
