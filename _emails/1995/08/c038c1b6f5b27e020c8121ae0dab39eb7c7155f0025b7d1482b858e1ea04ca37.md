As some of you know, I work for a LAN-Telephony company. One of our
products is a hardware based computer telephony product that we will be
able to provide at less than $100 per node. The product contains a CPU as
well as a DSP and is ideally suited for voice transmission with encryption
over networks.

We inted to make this product fully interoperate with software based
PGPFone implementations and also lending our computer telephony experience
to the PGPFone development team. This cooperation will provide hundreds of
thousands of corporate users with PGPFone compatible, rock solid, call
security at a fraction of the cost of today's "secure" phones. Our
expertise will also help improve the performance of the software based
freeware PGPFone implementations.

Sorry, I am unable to provide more details at this point.
