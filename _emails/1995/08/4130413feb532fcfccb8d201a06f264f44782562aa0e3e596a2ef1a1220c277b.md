There a 32 bit OS2 app which TJ Hardin compiled, it's on the ftp and
web site.  It was compiled with the OS2 version of gcc.

A the moment, there is no C code version of the client, it's perl
only, and I suspect would not work under OS/2 even with the perl for
OS2 even without a fair bit of work.

You could, however, use the WWW key doler, there's a place where you
can request keyspace.
