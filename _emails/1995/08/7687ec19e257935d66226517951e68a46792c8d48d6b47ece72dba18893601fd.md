Yep, and it uses a nine digit number, what convienience.

Nope, those are in the works, well biotelemetry devices are.

They'll need to change those, kids are having too much fun attaching them
to the innocent before they leave the store..

The infrastructure is in place for the implantable short range devices all
that is needed is a reader at a credit terminal. No, I don't see this as
being implemented.

Check out the pattent office for some interesting new devices in the works.
One is has wide bandwidth outgoing channel and a low bandwidth incomming
control channel. Range on the outgoing channel is 300 yards. This is
through the skin.
