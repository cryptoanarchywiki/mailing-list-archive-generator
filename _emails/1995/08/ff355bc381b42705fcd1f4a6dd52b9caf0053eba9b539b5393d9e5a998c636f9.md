I'm not sure, and I do not wish to speculate just now, with so many
people on this list who are so much better qualified to speculate
on the NSA's motivations than I am.

Perhaps my word "implicit" was poorly chosen. Anyway, going 
from silence to non-silence counts for _something_, and I doubt 
this kind of step was taken without high level thought or consul-
tation or infighting, considering the NSA's former near-monopoly on
strong cryptograpy capabilities.

PS
I doubt *anyone* on this list is stupid, though all of us probably
do stupid things from time to time...  ;-)
