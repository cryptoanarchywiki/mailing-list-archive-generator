Could someone with a few things handy compile Andrew Roos code so that
we have a nice handy pre-compiled DOS binary.

A must will be a DOS binary, what other platforms?

	- DOS (Need Microsoft visual C++ I think this is what Andrew used,
		there is an assembler speed up file)

	- OS/2?

	- PowerPC + MAC?

Any other architecture you would like to see a binary made available
for.

Please send binary to Piete (cc line) or me, and it would be nice if
you could provide a detatched PGP signature also.

The tar file is at:

	http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/brutessl.tar.gz

There is a pointer to brutessl.tar.gz.  You'll need to use save next
link ( "shift and click" on URL in netscape 1.1 ), or whatever
mechanism your browser provides.

You'll also need TAR.EXE and GZIP.EXE for DOS to unpack a .tar.gz file.

In case this is a problem I have just created this:

	http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/brutessl/

containing these files:

   2 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd          439 Jul 31 11:14 Makefile
   2 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd          602 Jul 31 17:19 README
  34 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd        16450 Jul 31 17:20 assembly.c
  42 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd        21373 Jul 31 17:21 brutessl.c
   6 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd         2776 Jul 31 17:21 brutessl.h
  26 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd        12709 Jul 31 17:21 brutessl.txt
   2 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd          351 Aug 19 20:31 chal2.pf
   2 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd          264 Jul 31 17:21 chal1.pf
  34 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd        16500 Jul 31 17:22 search.c
   2 -rw-r--r--    1 aba      phd          296 Jul 31 17:22 test.pf

You should be able to access them individually as:

	http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/brutessl/Makefile

etc.

(just in case you can't handle TAR / GZIP files on your DOS machine).

chal1.pf is the challenge that Damien just broke, chal2.pf is my first
attempt at producing a challenge file for Hal's next challenge.

The challenge info will be at:

	http://www.brute.cl.cam.ac.uk/brute/

when it starts.
