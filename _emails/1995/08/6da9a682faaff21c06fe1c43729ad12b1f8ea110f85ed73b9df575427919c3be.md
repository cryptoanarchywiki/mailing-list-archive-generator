Well, no, but I do have access to a lot of computer equipment(*) and some 
'unusual' connectivity software floating around.

I don't.

I guess this proves I'm a spook. My friends probably suspected as much... :-)

You know, now that I think about it, I probably *am* quite "mysterious" 
to the great majority of people who know of me personally (off-net), for a 
variety of reasons.
