As far as I know, the first transaction took place when I (while
testing) bought a postcard from GlobalX, the first ecash store to
open besides our own (and mine). It is stored in the 'DigiCash
museum' next to early prototypes of all kinds of smartcards,
emulators, wallets etc.

This must have been around October last year (or August? Can't make
out the postmark). Hundreds of cards were shipped by several shops,
and stickers, lotteries, etc. Check the 'physical objects' section
on http://www.digicash.com/shops/categorical.html

Maybe you should restrict the 'first known' claim to 'first known 
purchase of physical goods with cyberbucks traded at the ECM'.

Sorry!
