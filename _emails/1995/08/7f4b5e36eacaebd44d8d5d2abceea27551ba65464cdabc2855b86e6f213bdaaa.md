Hmm, I don't know about anyone else around here, but my workstation is
idle 99% of the time. I could almost certainly get access to all the spare
CPU cycles on 120 workstations for free, and I suspect that a lot of
people (particularly hackers) could do so as well. There's no need to
spend $ 10,000 on renting them.
