C-punks:

This "change" that encryption software can be exported if the keys are
escrowed means nothing.  PGP still couldn't be exported, since it can
generate its own keys.  You can be sure that any program that generates
its own keys couldn't be exported.  How are you going to escrow 2^100
possible keys (or whatever it is that PGP can generate)?

Thus, this regulatory change means diddly-squat.  The only crypto that 
could be exported would be something like Clipper, and they already said
that could be exported.

Governments:  can't live with 'em, can't shoot 'em.

Regards,
