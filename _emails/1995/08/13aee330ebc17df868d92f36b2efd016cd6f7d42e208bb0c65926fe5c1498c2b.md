I am saddened to learn this.

And, yes, this has a lot to do with Cypherpunks. I read "Stand on Zanzibar"
with rapt attention in 1969 or so, and it had a big influence on me.

Ditto for "The Shockwave Rider," one of the very first explications of how
identities would be changed, how the State would insist on computerized
identities. (Indeed, "1984" came first, and is an even more important work,
by any standards, but Brunner still nailed the effects of computers in a
way that Orwell could not possibly have.)

Christ, what an imagination he had!
