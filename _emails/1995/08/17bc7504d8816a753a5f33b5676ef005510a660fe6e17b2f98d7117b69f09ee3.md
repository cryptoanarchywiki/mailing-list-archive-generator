I was in the USAF 1987-1990, Tenn ANG 1990-1.  Documents are classified 
to five levels:

EEFI:  Essential Elements of Friendly Information-- pieced together, 
documents containing EEFIs may compromise classified info.  Usually, 
documents containing EEFIs are classified FOUO, but it is not required.

FUOU:  Usually not considered damaging by themselves.  FUOU documents are 
not considered classified, per se.
CONFIDENTIAL:
SECRET:
TOP SECRET:  These three differ in a matter of degrees.  Secret/Top 
             Secret information may cost lives, or millions of $.

All TOP SECRET information is automatically given an SCI (Special 
Compartmentalized Information) Category, and placed on a NTK (Need To 
Know) only access.  Many of the SCI abbreviations are themselves 
classified TS.  (The only one I know is "Q"--Nuclear.)  Each time 
clearance is extended to a new SCI, a new security background check must 
be made.

If you have clearance Q, and you want to see the plans for the MX, you 
had better be able to demonstrate NTK (usually from orders).


And no--there is no way under the sun that TS is going to be removed any 
time soon.
