I sent this originally only to Piete, but as I suspect he is already 
somewhat busy, I am now also forwarding a copy to the list.

I just upgraded to brclient version 0.16.
I tried to use it with this command:
brclient -Ltssl -a'2977 6284 390a 3 no'
I got this result:
Use of uninitialized variable at ./brclient line 457, <COMMAND> line 1.
Failed: 0 <No DATA>

I am totally perl.clueless, so I merely refer this to you.
