howdy,

time is not money if you're a high school student with nothing else to 
do.  time is not money if you're a grad student.  i spend approx 14 hrs 
or more a day in the lab seven days a week.  there's no way my stipend 
adds up to anything close to minimum wage at that rate.  

the value of time is subjective.  if i had a wife and a couple of kids 
AND i was a grad student, my time would be worth more.  as it is, my time 
is not worth a whole lot.

you're assessment that this cost our anon friend some money to obtain 
these cc numbers is simply not true.  when you have nothing else to do, 
choosing one thing over another involves no cost.  if anything, he made 
money by using the cc numbers to make long dist calls instead of using 
any cash he might have from working or an allowance.
