Hey guys,
    I know next to nothing on this sort of stuff, but I do have a friend 
that works at the phone company...I'm REALLY interested in learning the 
ins and outs of the trade... have any Ideas where I can start? what files 
I should read, etc...

                            I would appreciate your help...
                                 Mabidex  102415.404@Compuserve.com
