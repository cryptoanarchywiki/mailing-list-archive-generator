   "Dissidents Use Computer Network to Rile Scientology."

      The Church of Scientology is battling a band of on-line
      dissidents who have used the Internet to mail out
      globally its secret scriptures. On Saturday, as a result
      of a copyright infringement lawsuit, US marshals seized
      the computer of a former church employee who had
      electronically posted a 13-page text that he said was
      available in court records.

      Helena K. Kobrin, a lawyer for the church, said: "There
      are people out there who somehow think the Internet has
      created a new medium where all the rules go away, and
      it's not true. Things happen faster on the Internet, and
      we're going to keep up."
