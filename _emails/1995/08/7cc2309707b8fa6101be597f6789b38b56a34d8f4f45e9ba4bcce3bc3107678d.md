Thats certainly something people expect to do -- I'll begin letting
people at my code in a couple of weeks.

There is a mailing list for IPSEC developers right now -- people who
have read the RFCs and decide to get serious might want to subscribe.

Kernel sources are important here -- if you don't have kernel sources
IPSEC may be a challenge to put into a kernel...

Steve Bellovin has a summer student who did an interesting wedge on
PCs running packet driver interfaces in which he interposed his stuff
between the stack and the real packet driver. However, this can only
be of use for host-host keying and not user-user which is the real goal.
