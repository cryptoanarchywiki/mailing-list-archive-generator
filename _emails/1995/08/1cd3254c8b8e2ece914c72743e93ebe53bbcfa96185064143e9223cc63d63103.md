My point exactly.  My post "Stop Fixating on True Names" was an attempt to
clarify things to said people.


Look at it this way:  leaving aside the fact that a Man-In-The-Middle has to
do a little more fast footwork than a normal old eavesdropper does, public
key cryptography does not actually give you *any* advantage over symmetric-key
cryptography except for this one fact:


You can ask George what Alice's public key is, but you can't ask him what
her-and-your shared (symmetric) secret key is!


- From this perspective, the Web of Trust is the soul of public-key
cryptography.  From the other perspective ("Never ever sign a key which you
got off of a bulletin board!" warns "pgpdoc1.txt") it is a cute anachronism.


By the way, you mentioned "people who don't fully understand the issue"--
a brief survey of e-mail and posts I have seen on this subject indicates to
me that even knowledgeable people like the cypherpunks are about evenly split
on whether they appreciate this concept or not.


[note:  I've been cc:'ing messages to c'punks accidentally after I upgraded
to mh.  My apologies.  At least they weren't completely without
relevance...]
