Agreed.

*But* the real cost to a particular organisation, is subsidised by the
amount of idle compute cycles they have.  You can't take this into
account very easily or accurately for a general figure, where raw $
are probably the best figure.

For instance I know someone who works for a large UK newspaper (he's
admin for their unix workstations), and he says there are acres of
RS6000s just sitting there idling most of the time.  They are used for
document preparation only (what a waste all that lovely silicon just
burning cylces, and being occasionally used as a glorified word
processor).

Anyway point being to that particular organisation, if they for some
reason (I dunno but say a big scoop - they need to nefariously break
something to get the low down on a politician - unofficially of
course), their real cost is quite a bit lower than the raw $, perhaps
0 cost even if they can wait long enough for their impromptu farm to
do the job.

This doesn't really affect the raw $ cost as such, people just need to
estimate the amount of wasted $ equivalent of idle compute they
already have in their personal calculations.

It would sound better if various news papers would care to print
something along the lines of "with idle compute powers as many typical
organisations have in abundance".  Papers printing high sounding $
figures is though technically accurate (perhaps not too sure about the
accuracy), mis-leading to general public who probably don't realise
that there is a few $100 tho of idle compute lying around in the
accounts department already!

In summary, yes but it doesn't sound as good, and folks don't equate
idle CPU to $ intuitively.
