Let's not get implementations confused with algorithms ...
We were using ALPHA code when we started ....

With BETA clients, a hierarchy and select/poll loops, I reckon a server would 
stand a chance.

Sure.

Un ACKed space is re-allocated after the first scan has completed.

Few systems can resist such an attack !

... causing them ... yes -- especially (1) !!

(4) is still applicable isn't it ?
What tells people to stop, or do they go on for ever ?

(3) is just the same for the server -- it re-allocates.
(4) would require a restart :-(

where "expected" is some loose average .....

My stats is *very* rusty, but I'd have thought it would be somewhat less than 
twice a linear search ...
However, I agree that as a ballpark figure, yes: it would be somewhere between 
N/2 and N ...

IMPLEMENTATION !

random probing does indeed have its merits.

Personally I'd go for a scheme whereby on finishing a random search, the 
client multicast a PGP signed message (there would be a WWW/email/telnet/... 
interface which would multicast for our non-connected members) allowing 
interested parties
1) to gather stats as to what actually happened
2) maps of "unsearched" areas to be built by anyone wanting to fill gaps
3) the "big boys" could learn to trust each other and use (2).
4) when all notified keys are tried, go in to killer mode, and try to find
   who is untrustworthy.  Someone can only try it once, and getting a "big boy"
   tag takes a while, and a lot of CPU cycles !

Convince me (please) ....

What size "chunks" should be scanned ?

See above ... the big boys will do it eventually ...

It has its advantages -- yes. Did you use it for Hal1 ?  :-))
