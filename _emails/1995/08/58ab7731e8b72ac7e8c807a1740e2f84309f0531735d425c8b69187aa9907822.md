I don't know off the top of my head who makes DES and RSA chips.  I am
sure there are many manufactors of DES chips. Try TI, National, and
Motorola. I belive that Schneier has a list of RSA chip makers.

For the DSP part of a "bump in the cord" encrytion box, you want to get
the "TI TMS320 Family Development Support" booklet by calling (800)
477-8924. You also want to look at Motorola's 68000 CPU, DSP, and
controller on one chip. I can't recall the exact product number. Just call
Motorola and ask for it.

Have fun,
