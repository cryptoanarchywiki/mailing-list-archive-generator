The Business Week Guide to Global Investments using Electronic Tools.

Dear Cypherpunks,

   While I was hunting around a Waldenbooks store, I found the above
named book. Its by Robert Schwabach, published by Osborne McGraw-Hill.
It retails at $39.95 and comes with 3 3 1/2" diskettes. I just glanced
thru it. It may be of interest to some Cypherpunks. I don't know if it
would be useful for PRIVATE foreign investing or not.

                                                      Yours Truly,
                                                      Gary Jeffers
