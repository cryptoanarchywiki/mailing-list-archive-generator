I didn't realise that.

A message in a newsgroup, a mailing list, or a web page.  Even if you
can mount a denial-of-service against this, it will only make people
continue the search uselessly.  It won't prevent you from finding the
key.

Nope.  It's what I get when I do the math (basic probability theory)
to find the expected running time.  But I could be wrong.  I'll try to
write it in TeX and put it on my web page.

That would be hard because I've been thinking about it, and I'm less
and less convinced myself.


>> In conclusion, I think random searching is the way to go.

No, but I had few machines and fast connections (and even then, I did
have some network problems).  But if you think sequential searching
can work, let's do it.  I don't think we have to worry about
deliberate attacks for the moment, and the factor of two is
significant.  My previous message was based on the assumption that it
would be hard to get rid of the server overload.

Maybe we should use random searching as a fallback mode in case of
network problems.  It cannot hurt, except that it makes the programs
more complex.
