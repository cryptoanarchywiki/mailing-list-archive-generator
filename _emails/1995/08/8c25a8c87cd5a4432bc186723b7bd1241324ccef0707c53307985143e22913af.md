     Page 7A of today's _Baltimore Sun_ features an op-ed piece by Carl
R. Eisendrath, "a former U.S. foreign-service officer", entitled "Bringing
Light to Covert Operations", which cites an interesting quotation:

     "In the period between the two world wars, Secretary of War Henry
      Stimson closed the cryptography section of the State Department
      because, as he reputedly said, "Gentlemen don't read each other's
      mail."
