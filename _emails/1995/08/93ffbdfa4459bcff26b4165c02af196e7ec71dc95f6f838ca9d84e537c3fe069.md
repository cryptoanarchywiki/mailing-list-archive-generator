Missile targeting software depends on good models of the earth's gravity
for accuracy, both for design and for simulation purposes.  Since Ft. Meade
was doubtless the target of many nukes during the cold war (and probably
still is), that may account for them having a bug up their asses on the
subject.

'Course you know the NSA;  the world's largest employer of mathematicians,
the largest purchaser of computer hardware, and the largest consumer of
Thorazine.
