While watching the coverage of the OJ circus, I just heard Judge Ito say
about a tape that has been recorded over a couple of times:

"I doubt that it's recoverable, except by the NSA, and I doubt they're
going to help us."

I saw the lawyers smile, so they caught the reference.

Anybody who thinks the NSA remains obscure isn't watching enough t.v.!

Special note: My ISP has changed its domain name from "sensemedia.net" to
"got.net" (as in "got milk?"), so I have to again ask you all to bear with
me and use my new e-mail address, "tcmay@got.net".
