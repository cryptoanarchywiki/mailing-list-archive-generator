Big Brother? Big Sister? Naw, it's "Big Tits."

It's a way for we males to scan the females at the bar to see if they're
naturally well-endowed or silicone-enhanced. Part of the "truth in
advertising" laws recently passed.

...

Seriously, I'm awfully skeptical that any kind of remote sensing device is
to be placed in the breasts of women seeking enhancement. The technology
just does not currently support small devices, though I suppose some of the
55GG strippers could support an active transmitter (or, "transtitter").

Conceivably, when the women go down to their local doctors to have their
tits inflated there can be some kind of "taggants" added, a la the taggants
added to some explosives, but this is a far cry from an electronic
identificaton device.

Some boob must've come up with this one.
