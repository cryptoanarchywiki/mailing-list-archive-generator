One way to achieve this is to provide multi-layered generic "compression" 
hooks which get called in this manner:

 Compress[x](char *bufferin, size_t insize, char *bufferout, size_t *osize);

Then you chain several of these by alternating the in/out buffers, say 
something like this:

 for (i=0; i<MAXCOMPRESSORS; i+=2)
 {
  Compress[i](buffer1,size1,buffer2,&size2);
  Compress[i+1](buffer2,size2,buffer1,&size1);
 }

To decompress, you'd do something like this:

 for (i=MAXCOMPRESSORS-1; i; i-=2)
 {
  Decompress[i+1](buffer2,size2,buffer1,&size1);
  Decompress[i](buffer1,size1,buffer2,&size2);
 }

This lets you set up a chain of compressors, each compressing the output 
of the previous levels.  And what you do is allow these compressors to be 
external to the program!  (If one or more of those should be hooks to 
encrypt, well, hey, that's just a 'bug' ;-)

Basically this does C1(C2(C3(C4...CN(text)))))...) to compress the output of 
the previous compressors.  I would reccomend that the last in the set be 
the encryptors or else all the other compressors would fail. :-)

Now, would >THAT< be exportable?
