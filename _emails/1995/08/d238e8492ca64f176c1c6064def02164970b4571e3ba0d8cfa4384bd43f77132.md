This doesn't seem likely. I mean, doesn't "RSA-in-4-lines-of-Perl" *of
necessity* make use of external library/utility functions? Such as the "dc"
math routines for the PRNG? Part of its compactness is that it makes use of
available libraries.

Anything that "reaches out" to external libraries or utilities would then
have the vulnerabilities of _those_ libraries and utilities, which may or
may not be provably correct themselves. (And the issue of any PRNG being
probably correct or not is of course an interesting, and deep, question.)

I do think the issues of modular design and provable correctness--or
approximations to it--are interesting ones.
