Not for many hours, but we had an interesting non-discussion, and there
was a really thorough search of my bags (every piece of paper was
individually examined in great detail and a guard was subtly added to
the other side of the line).  They looked at every slide, checked out
the bags themselves for secret compartments, but the one thing they
didn't do was check the contrnts of my floppy disks.  Istn't technology
wonderful?
