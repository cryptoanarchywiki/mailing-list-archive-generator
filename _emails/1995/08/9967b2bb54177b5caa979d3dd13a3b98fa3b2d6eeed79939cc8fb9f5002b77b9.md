I talked the guy out of using an analogy with physical key length (the kind
you stick in a door) and he settled on "10^26" rather than a power of 2.
Also, I gave hime the relevant names, e-mail addresses, and URL's, but
didn't have any phone numbers.

BTW, in the "cryptography experts and hackers and mathematicians" as well
as the whole "hacker" slant, smells like an editor.
