-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

As you may have seen, the news media has picked up on the upcoming
PGPfone release. This note is to let you know that we at MIT are working
with Phil Zimmermann and the PGPfone team to distribute PGPfone from
MIT. We expect to have a *BETA* test version (Macintosh Only) of PGPfone
available shortly.

We will distribute PGPfone via anonymous FTP from net-dist.mit.edu. Look
in the /pub/PGPfone directory (which doesn't yet exist).

We will also be distributing PGP via the World Wide Web from:

                   http://web.mit.edu/network/pgpfone

This "Home" page already exists, but doens't have the distribution yet.
Feel free to check it periodically, as it will be changed as soon as the
distribution is ready.

                                -Jeff
