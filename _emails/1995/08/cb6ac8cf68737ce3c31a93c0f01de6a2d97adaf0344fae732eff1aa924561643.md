Fellow Cypherpunks:

Below is the URL of an "Online Forum" page to allow 
'Net citizens vote on various, (usually boring) issues.

So last week I was surfin', wastin' time, and drinkin'
a brew, and I happened by. I was asked to vote on some
mundane topic [I forget what]--and instead I suggested
a "World Vote" topic I liked better, and, sure enough,
they put it up this week: [I was shocked when they e-
mailed me!]
:-)

[guess how Jim Ray voted...] ;-)

       OK. Far be it from me to suggest vote fraud
[there aren't too many Libertarians in cemetaries
anyway :)] but I think certain cypherpunks might
want to go "vote" this week, if you have the time
to waste.

Please vote *only* once, and tell all your buddies.
Thanks.
JMR
