RSA's home page (http://www.rsa.com) has a demo version of RSA Secure.
This is a disk/directory encryption program that serves the same
purpose as Secure Drive and SFS. According to their description, it
allows you to select only certain files to be encrypted, and uses
80-bit RC4. The demo/export version is only 40 bits.

It also has optional key escrow. You can choose to escrow a key by
secret-sharing it and giving pieces to various people. There is a
threshold system so m of n people have to cooperate to decrypt it.
