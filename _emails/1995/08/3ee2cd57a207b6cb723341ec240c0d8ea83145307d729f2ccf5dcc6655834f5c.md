I don't bet money but I'd bet a debit note of 1U$ that it'll happen after
it appears in someones home directory, is multiply encrypted and
anonymously mailed. I give it about 78msec after the recievers local
hardware is done crunching for it to be on it's way. ;-)

I say substantially less than 24hrs...

Ayep.
