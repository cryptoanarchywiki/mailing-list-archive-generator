Darned close.  The article I saw said it detects the period of black
and silence and puts a `notch' on the tape at each such switch.  The
notch can be detected at fast-forward speeds.  My question is - what
happens if there is black/silence *between commercials*?  How does
the VCR know that what follows a mark is show or merely the next
commercial?
