What!?!?!?!  I guess I'm not totally surprised - registration of all children
has been high on Clinton's agenda ever since he's been in the White House.
One of the more blatant examples was the child vaccination proposals - which
first started out as "take over the vaccination system and register all kids
so we can remind their parents to get their shots", and gradually included 
less and less control and funding of vaccination while retaining the
registration.
Sigh.

Storyteller makes no choice - soon you will not hear his voice.
His job was to shed light, and not to master.      RIP, Jerry
