It would depend on what the license agreement said.

But why not just write a wrapper which strips out the 88 bits of plaintext
key?  (A "leaf blower" if you like:)  If you could get the author of slirp
to include it in his distribution, it would definately get used.  All you
would have to say is "This is a patch to ensure that netscape encryption
is properly secure when using slirp, and here are the diffs..."
