     Your solution fails against your specified threat.  Children who
are more software-proficient than their parents will, in many cases,
be able to access their parents' accounts and modify the configuration
file (or simply use the account to access the blocked areas).
Ultimately, all such systems are "home-based" if any accounts used by
members of the household have or can be granted access to the naughty
bits (tip o' the hat to M. Python).

     While your proposal is obviously marketable, given the success of
Prodigy and the prospects for SurfWatch, it does not appear to be
inherently more secure than schemes that utilize subscriber software.
