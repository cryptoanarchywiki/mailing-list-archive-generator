There are 2 (well 4 actually) suppliers of shirts:

1) (US/Canada) Joel Furr at Josh Osborne's instigation (no current offer,
   but still to send out shirts from first batch)  OFFER PASSED

2) (free world :-) Me - Adam Back <aba@dcs.ex.ac.uk>
   http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa UK printing cost only - still taking orders
   1st batch will be ordered RSN

3) (US/Canada) Don Henson <dhenson@itsnet.com> http://colossus.net/wepinsto/
   25% of proceeds to Phil Z legal defense fund - 1st batch shipped, taking
   orders next batch

4) (AU region of free world) Lucy Chubb <lucyc@suite.sw.oz.au>
   (no WWW URL yet) will soon be printing some in Australia cost only also
   send her email for status, starting soon

The last I heard about the status of Joel's shirts was on the netstuff
mailing list, some time ago, he said there had been delays due to
various reasons, and that his shirst wouldn't be ready until end July.
As July has ended, I'm presuming this will be RSN.

The people who have their shirts are those who ordered through Don
Henson, who has proceeded very quickly to ship shirts, he was the
start of the 350 ordered thread.
