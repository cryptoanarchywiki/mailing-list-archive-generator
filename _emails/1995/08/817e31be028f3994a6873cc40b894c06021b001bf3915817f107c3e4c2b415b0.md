You sure are anxious to prosecute government officials.  What is untrue 
about her statement.  Maybe she meant it's OK to use ROT-13 but nothing 
else ...

And you guys complained about the Jake Baker prosecution!

BTW, Harris is no longer AAG-Criminal Division.  She went back to 
teaching, keeping a commitment she made to her family.  And yes, she was 
appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
