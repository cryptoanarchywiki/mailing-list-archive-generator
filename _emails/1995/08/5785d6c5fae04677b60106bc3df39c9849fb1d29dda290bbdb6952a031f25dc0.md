Eventually people will bypass the banks, directly transferring funds
to each other.  This will reduce the banks fees to zero.  The
banks will gradually lose control of the indecently lucrative 
funds transfer business, and have to go to the bread and butter 
business of borrowing short and lending long, and evaluating 
credit worthiness, and providing guarantees of payment.
