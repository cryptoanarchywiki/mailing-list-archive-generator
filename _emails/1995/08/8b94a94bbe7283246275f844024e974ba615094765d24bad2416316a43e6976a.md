My company sold stock to me directly, through a Stock Participation Plan
and an Incentive Stock Option Plan.

I use a debit card which directly accesses my stock account. More on this
in a moment.

This is where it breaks down. Stock prices are denominated in dollars (or
the local currency, as applicable). And local purchases are denominated in
dollars. Nobody pays "one microMicrosoft" for a loaf of bread. They pay $1.
And Microsoft stock sells for $100, not 100 loaves of bread.

The IRS and other tax authorities have this one figured out: barter
economies are not generally a way to avoid taxes.

If you are paid in barter for some service, taxes are still owed, based on
the estimated value of services rendered.

By the way, a simpler example than all this talk of partial shares of
companies is simply to talk about paying each other in gold, or oil, or any
other commodities.

Try to convince the IRS that taxes are not owed because one was paid in
ounces of gold instead of dollars.
