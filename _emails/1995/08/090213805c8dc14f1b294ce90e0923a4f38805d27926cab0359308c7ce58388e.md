Not having my copy of The Differential Cryptanalysis of the Data
Encryption Standard handy, I'd like to know about the distributability
of this type of DES attack.  Done right, we could significantly reduce
the time complexity.
	The main problem, of course, would be coordinating such an effort.  I
seem to recall this attack requiring lots of known plaintexts.  Time
to review the text, I suppose....
	Does the Federal Reserve still use single-key DES?
