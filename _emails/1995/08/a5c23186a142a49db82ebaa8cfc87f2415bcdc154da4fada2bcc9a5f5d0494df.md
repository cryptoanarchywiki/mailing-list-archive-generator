The way the system works at my local library is that there _is_ a strip 
embedded in the spine and it isn't demagnetized by a quick tap by rubbing 
it several times over a demagnetizer (there's a big sticker on the side 
that says not to leave any magnetic storage media near it).   As far as 
magazines go, my library simply doesn't let people borrow them (which 
means if it ain't there, it's stolen).  Anyone know how they protect 
against magazine theft (okay, no crypto relevance.  reply to me and not 
the list, then).  Later.
