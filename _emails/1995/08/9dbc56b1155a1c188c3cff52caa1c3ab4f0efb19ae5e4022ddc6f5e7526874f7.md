>1996 IEEE Symposium on                              May 6-8, 1996
>Security and Privacy                            Oakland, California
>
>                             sponsored by
>  IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy
>                         in cooperation with
>    The International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)
>
>Since 1980, the Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier
>forum for presenting developments in computer security and for
>bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field.
>
>This year, we seek to build upon this tradition of excellence by
>re-emphasizing work on engineering and applications as well as
>theoretical advances.  We also seek to broaden the scope of the
>Symposium by introducing additional topics.  We want to hear not only
>about new theoretical results, but also about work in the design and
>implementation of secure systems and work on policy relating to system
>security.  We are particularly interested in papers on policy and
>technical issues relating to privacy in the context of the Information
>Infrastructure, papers on securing unsecure applications and operating
>systems, papers that relate software and system engineering technology
>to the design of secure systems, and papers on hardware and
>architectural support for secure systems.
>
>The symposium will focus on technical aspects of security and privacy
>as they arise in commercial and industrial applications, as well in
>government and military systems.  It will address advances in the
>theory, design, implementation, analysis, and application of secure
>computer systems, and in the integration and reconciliation of
>security and privacy with other critical system properties such as
>reliability, performance, and safety.  Topics in which papers and
>panel session proposals are invited include, but are not limited to,
>the following:
>
>
>Secure systems          Privacy Issues          Access controls
>Security verification   Network security        Policy modeling
>Information flow        Authentication          Database security
>Data integrity          Security Protocols      Viruses and worms
>Auditing                Biometrics              Smartcards
>Commercial and industrial security              Intrusion Detection
>Security and other critical system properties   Distributed systems security
>Novel applications of cryptography and other security techniques
>
>We will continue the session of very brief (5-minute) talks introduced
>last year.  Our goal is to make it possible for us to hear from people
>who are advancing the field in the areas of system design and
>implementation, and who would like to present their ideas to the
>symposium audience but may lack the time and resources needed to
>prepare a full paper.  Submissions for this session will be accepted
>up to April 2, 1996 to permit us to hear of the most recent
>developments. Abstracts of these talks will be distributed at the
>conference.
>
>INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS:
>
>Send six copies of your paper and/or proposal for a panel session to
>John McHugh, Program Co-Chair, at the address given below.  Papers and
>panel proposals must be received by November 6, 1996.  Papers, which
>should include an abstract, must not exceed 7500 words.  The names and
>affiliations of the authors should appear on a separate cover page
>only, as a ``blind'' refereeing process is used.  In addition to the
>paper submission, an ASCII copy of the paper title and abstract should
>be sent to the Program Co-Chair (mchugh@cs.pdx.edu) by electronic mail.
>These will be distributed electronically (without author
>identification) to the entire program committee to aid in the
>appropriate assignment of referees. Authors must certify prior to
>December 25, 1996 that any and all necessary clearances for
>publication have been obtained.
>
>Papers must report original work that has not been published
>previously, and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.
>Abstracts, overlength papers, electronic submissions, late
>submissions, and papers that cannot be published in the proceedings
>will be rejected without review.  Authors will be notified of
>acceptance by January 16, 1996.  Camera-ready copies are due not later
>than March 4, 1996.
>
>Panel proposals should describe, in two pages or less, the objective
>of the panel and the topic(s) to be addressed.  Names and addresses of
>potential panelists (with position abstracts if possible) and of
>the moderator should also be included.  Panels are not intended to
>serve as alternate paper sessions and it is expected that, with the
>possible exception of an overview of the topic area by the panel
>chair, individual presentations by panel members will be limited to
>five to ten minutes and that at least one third of the session will be
>reserved for discussion.
>
>Submitters of abstracts for the special session of five-minute talks
>should submit one page abstracts to John McHugh, Program Co-Chair, at
>the address given below.  The abstract should be one page or less;
>Email submissions of 30 to 60 lines are preferred. Abstracts must be
>received by April 2, 1996.  Authors will be notified of acceptance or
>rejection of abstracts by April 16.  Submitted abstracts that are
>accepted will be distributed at the conference.  Presenters of
>five-minute talks are expected to register for the conference.
>Overtly commercial presentations are inappropriate.
>
>The Symposium will also include informal poster sessions where
>preliminary or speculative material, and descriptions or
>demonstrations of software, may be presented.  Send one copy of your
>poster session paper to Dale Johnson, at the address given below, by
>January 31, 1996, together with certification that any and all
>necessary clearances for presentation have been obtained.
>
>Again this year, we will attempt to counsel prospective authors.  If
>you have questions about whether or how to present your work to the
>symposium, please send email to the Chair (dmj@mitre.org), and we will
>do our best to assist you.
>
>Information about this conference will be also be available by
>anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.pdx.edu in directory /pub/SP96, on the web
>at http://www.cs.pdx.edu/SP96. The program chairs can be reached by
>email at sp96@cs.pdx.edu.
