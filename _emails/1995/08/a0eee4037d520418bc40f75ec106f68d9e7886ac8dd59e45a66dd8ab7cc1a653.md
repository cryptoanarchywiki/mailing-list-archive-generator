Seems like a good-press piece for a small anti-viral software
company.  Just one small pick to nit:

What?  Toolkit?  A virus toolkit?

Windows NT has an abstracted and object oriented design.  User mode
programs no longer have access to the hardware (ie., you no longer
have access to the boot sector, and cannot hook an interrupt).  In
short, viruses are much less likely to function under NT, yet these
blood-sucking people can't wait to introduce software for it...
