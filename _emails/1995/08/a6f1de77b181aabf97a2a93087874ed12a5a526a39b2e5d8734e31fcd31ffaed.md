Not sure what you mean ....

Currently there are many machines involved ...

sksp		odd & sods.
sksp-ack	just ACKs.
sksp-key	just keyspace allocation
ftp		just FTPs
www		just WWW

stats are WWW only, with updates being done by ACKs machine.

How ?

Nah ....

local to whom ?

No -- different server.

As in a hierarchy ?
This is being thought about ...

brloop does that for brutessl attempts ...

Let me know what stats you want ...
