This is a true statement.  Tens of thousands of people have dies because
cryptosystems were trusted when they should not have been (hind sight
being 20/20 of course).

So you believe that there are no backdoors because it was released from
Europe and people have looked at it since.

I think that you miss the point.  If you worked for the NSA, you would
probably say this as well.  The point is that, for the purposes of
looking at the security of PGP, we should assume that you have evil
intent, whether you do or not.

I didn't say that the NSA bought you.  I asked " Why (specifically)..."
The question mark at the end is a dead give-away.  It is factually
accurate that government agencies have gotten the cooperation of
academics in the past to carry out subversions in order to further their
goals.  I asked "Do you somehow think that MIT and the NSA are above
that sort of thing?"  You apparently do, but history tell us that it is
imprudent to do this.

So if there has been a failure in communications in this respect, I
appologize for not making it as clear as I might have.  If you feel
personally slighted, I am sorry that you feel this way.  Nevertheless, I
believe that it is prudent to believe that the NSA has "bought you" for
the purpose of assessing the security of PGP and to ask the question
"Why (specifically) do you think so?"

I have not refused to do any such thing.  I have had a copy of PGP for
quite some time, but it is too large and complex for me to verify by
hand, and I know of no automated technique that can do the job in any
reasonable amount of time.  I was probably wrong to assume that this was
obvious.

>  So, what the hell do you want?  Do you want a line-by-line
> examination of the code????  Sheesh!

I think it would be prudent to do and publish a line-by-line walkthrough
of the source of PGP (although not to the whole list please).  You
should be trying to prove properties such as the non-interference of any
of the rest of the code with the key generation (or other) algorithms. 
This may be done by an information flow analysis similar to what was
done on our secure W3 server.  It would also be prudent to perform
adequate tests of the properties of inputs from people to determine the
true information content of the seeds and to publish these results so
they can be critiqued.  Perhaps it would also be valuable to have the
members of this list contribute ideas about properties they think would
be worth verifying.

The problem is that merely shipping however many lines of source code
does little to demonstrate its propriety.  A publicly posted version of
the source for IRC, for example, had an obvious Trojan horse that wasn't
detected for more than 6 months and was actively being used to attack
systems over the entire period.  In order to assess the source code, it
is necessary to also publish appropriate demonstrations of WHY it is
secure.

But don't you see? If I introduce a subtle backdoor and make it look
like a bug, I have plausible deniability.  Since I, as an independent
observer, cannot tell whether the hole is intentional or accidental, I
should, for the purposes of considering security, assume that it is
intentional.

But how can I, as an independent observer, tell if it is an accident or
a cleaverly intentional subversion? I cannot look into your brain and
tell the difference, and no statement you make can reasonably convince
me.  They may not be the same, but they are not differentiable by an
independent observer.  From a scientific point of view, they are the
same.  From a humanistic point of view they may be different.

You have it backwards.  You show me that the techniques you claim to be
truely random are indeed that.  Supposedly random number generators have
been created for many years, and plenty of them have been broken after
many years of being held to be secure with the algorithm and the full
details available for all to see.

That's exactly what the Germans said about the Enigma and others have
been saying about cryptosystems for the past 4,000+ years.  They have
been shown wrong again and again, and as a result, people like me want
more than just an "I believe it's secure".

I agree that it is often easier to break into the computer to get the
keys than it is to break the cryptosystem.  That was my next bone to
pick with PGP - the way it stores the keys.  But I'll save that for
another day.

For example, you can generate the most probable 10^40 or so input
sequences, do key generation, and test against them to find out if the
user's key is one of them.  The question I am posing could be considered
as a question of the information content of the original input to PGP's
key generation process.

How could this be subtly altered by a person responsible for maintaining
PGP or detected and not repaired by same? For example, a loop index
could be calculated incorrectly by having a different part of PGP
overwrite the loop index using an incorrect ponter conversion.  Then the
loop that uses all of the input bits would be subtly altered so as to
use fewer of them.  The results would still look random but the total
search space would be reduced to the point where a good supercomputer
could run through it in only a few hours.

And history tells us that the U.S.  government does this quite often. 
They are actively trying to harass PGP's author using a variety of what
could be reasonably called dirty tricks, they are actively trying to
prevent the use of good cryptography in the US, and they are actively
trying to make certain uses of cryptography illegal.  Why should I
believe that they would not also try to subvert PGP?

What I don't like is people that state it is secure but can't back it up
with real facts.  Why (specifically) do you believe PGP is secure?
Forget your ego and the posturing about how you are not working for the
NSA and come up with a really good demonstration of the reason PGP is
secure, and I will be very quick to commend you.

...
> Ok.  Please explain what kind of keystroke timing analysis you
> propose, and I will attempt to answer that, or concede your point.

Fair enough.  A useful first step would be to demonstrate the real
information content of the keystrokes and timings entered by the user
across a reasonable number of different platforms, users, and trials.
That would start to address the potential that there is a fundamental
mistake in (or intentional corruption of) the input process.

The demonstrations described earler would also be worthwhile in
demonstrating the lack of subtle interaction among the parts of PGP (I
refer to the information flow analysis).

After that, you should solicit other ideas from as wide an audience as
possible to see what sorts of properties should be considered for this
sort of program, and go about picking the most important ones first, and
so on.  I would be happy to discuss further details off-line.

Not a thought experiment, the Turing award paper in 1984 - came out just
a little bit after the IFIP conference in which computer viruses were
first publicly described and analyzed.

I think there is good supporting historical evidence for my questions.
But I don't believe I have made any "claims".
