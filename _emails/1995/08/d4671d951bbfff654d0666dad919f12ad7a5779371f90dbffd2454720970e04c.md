Not that I know of, but there were some versions with a bug in the random-input
generation - I forget if that was with ~2.2 or ~2.6.0; Colin Plumb had something
to do with it.  I've recently acquired ViaCrypt 2.7.1 for WinDows, and one
nice feature 
is that in addition to typing in random keystrokes, you can click your mouse in 
a box and wave it around to input randomness.
