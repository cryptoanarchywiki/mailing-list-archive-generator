Futplex sez:

: BTW, the code has been posted to Usenet by a Frank Falstaff -- look for
: message ID <40b8tk$cj4@news.xs4all.nl> in sci.crypt (Wed, Aug. 9, 1995).
: His article refers to a message ID (namely <40b50l$oa8@utopia.hacktic.nl>)
: that differs from the message ID of the copy sent to c'punks. So it looks
: like there was at least one additional recipient. That's a minimum of 5
: originals so far....

The remailers at utopia.hacktic.nl use news.xs4all.nl as their 
newsserver, all messages get an "news.xs4all.nl-ID", all mail
ID's will have "utopia.hacktic.nl" in it.
