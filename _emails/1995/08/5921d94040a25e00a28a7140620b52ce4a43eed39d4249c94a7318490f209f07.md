I think that the point of the news report was that in the past companies
were limited in the type of investor they could sell to (e.g., employee,
stock-broker). I assume what they meant by the report was that a company
under the new rules could sell stock to anyone who asked.

Prices could still be denominated in dollars, but the actual transaction
could be executed with stock value (at the current market price). There
would be an element of risk in these transactions since after the
transaction a stock's value might go down, but it might also go up as
well. I would think that if a merchant had a large volume of
transactions and a varied stock "intake" a merchants portfolio would
tend to balance out in terms of stock increases and decreases.

Hmmm, a "micro-spot" commodity market?
