If you know that's what the signal looks like, you can improve it a lot by
run-length encoding before doing the MD5, e.g. crunch the output down to 
a series of count1 value1 count2 value2 count3 value3 (if you stick to runs of
255, you can use 1 byte for each.)   That gives you a much shorter input to
the MD5,
and a more realistic view of how much random data you have.  
(I suppose it may make it harder to do things like Fourier transforms on it...)
