CEI makes a "Super Crypt Chip" that does single and tripple DES,
I beleve you can clock it at 25Mhz and get 32bits of cyphertext
out per cycle in single DES mode, it is somewhat slower (but not
three times slower) in tripple DES mode.  I beleve that's what
UUNET uses in their LanGuardian product.  I have the spec sheet in
a box somewhere if anyone needs the part number.   Definitly
more then fast enough to encrypt voice traffic.

>Are there any public key chips out there???

I think NEC makes one.  I know AT&T makes one.  DEC had some, but
they may not have been a comercial product.  Sorry I don't have part
numbers, and havn't read a spec sheet for any of them.

DEC had a chip in the lab that could RSA encrypt/decrypt at a rather
hiigh speed, unfortunitly I don't recall the speed - something like
a DS0's worth (or it may have as low as 32Kbits/sec worth) - less 
then a T1.

I have no doubt that there are some very fast hardware IDEA chips
(which is what I think you need to make go fast to get a hardware
PGPphone to go fast - well the codec as well)

I'm afarid it won't be $50 worth of parts untill you start buying
thousands of chips at once.
