 ... because we seem to be in the throes of a listwide piss-fight.

Unless we're the victim of duelling rant generators -- but I don't think
this is the case, as they all happened too fast.

It's a nice night. Maybe I'll go sit on the back porch and smoke the
base-ball-bat Macanudo (cigar) I bought at Erlich's today...

See you all in the morning. Don't forget to insulate yourselves, everyone...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga
