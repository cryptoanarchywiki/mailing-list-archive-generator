If I read this correctly, then the keys used for generation of the chosen  
plaintext-cyphertext pairs is irrelevant and once the required computation is  
done, one can crack any '...one of the keys can be cputed in real time while  
it is still valid.'..

So what, exactly does this mean?  Can I do most, if not all of the feeding of  
chosen plaintext into my personal DES box in my basement, do the required  
computation (admittedly there is a lot of work to do here), then go out and  
start breaking wire-transfers with a minimal of chosen plaintext?  That is  
what the above quotation would seem to imply.

Seems incredible...  I surely must be reading much more into the passage than  
is really there...
