I'm just about to fly out to San Francisco, and I realized that coming up 
is the second Saturday of the month, the traditional meeting time for the 
Bay Area Cypherpunks.  I haven't seen any meeting announcements, so 
please e-mail me if there 's one scheduled (and if you can give a ride 
from S.F. if so!).  I've just temporarily unsubscribed (I'll catch up on 
the archives when I return), so please cc me if you announce the meeting  
to the list.

Thanks,

Joe Thomas
