As long as the Netscape IPO topic has come up...

A former member of our list, Marc Andreessen, just became worth $70 million
or so in today's IPO. (IPO = Initial Public Offering, or "Internet PGP
Offering")

Personally, I think this valuation of Netscape at a few billion dollars is
way too high. They've got a leading product, which most folks have gotten
for free, and they've signed a bunch of corporate deals. But a few billion
for a brand new company?

...and who knows how many of their sudden multimillionaire developers will
now leave...?

Crypto could be the next big wave of IPOs, with "Verisign" and "RSADSI"
both rumored to be offered. Some of the digital commerce companies may be
next.

It seems that anything involving the Internet, the Web, and digital
commerce is really, really hot.

Special note: My ISP has changed its domain name from "sensemedia.net" to
"got.net" (as in "got milk?"), so I have to again ask you all to bear with
me and use my new e-mail address, "tcmay@got.net".
