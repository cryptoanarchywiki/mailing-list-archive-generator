I don't suppose anyone has access to Skipjack to verify or
refute this claim?

It is fairly simple to cut & paste 10 values ~25 times, it is harder
to write and verify code to initilize the array.

More intresting is that Gx[i % 10] is faster then a stright index
on many systems (anything you could expect cache line conflicts or
cache capacity overfills on, and supports a modulis signifigantly
faster then the first few parts of the memory hierachy).

Also note that the code may have been written from a dissasembled
binary rather then a hardware spec.
