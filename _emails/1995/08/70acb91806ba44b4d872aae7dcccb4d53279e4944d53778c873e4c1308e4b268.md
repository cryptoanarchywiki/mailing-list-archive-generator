They seem to be openly confronting the issue to me.  There is a stigma
attached to anonymity - haven't you seen the lone ranger?  If you're
honest, why do you wear a mask?

I think they contemplate the issues.  I think that most of them (us?)
realize that:

	They are the ones likely to be most harmed by a lack of open and
	honest communication. 

	By identifying themselves they might open themselves to undue
	risk of harm in the form of harassment, arrest, search and
	seizure of personal property, etc.

	The only way they can bot help preserve individual freedom for
	others and remain free themseleves is by saying some things
	anonymously.

They certainly see the advantages over the disadvantages.

There are times when identity is important, and there are times when it
is not.  Identity is not important when disclosing a danger - if you
yell "FIRE!!!" in a burning building, nobody is going to say "Hold on
there...  before I get out, what's your name and address, and how can
you prove that you are who you are?" They recognize the danger you
identified and get out of the building.  When I buy a can of fruit juice
from the local store and pay with cash, if they ask my name and address,
I tell them (politely) to stuff it.  You don't need to know my identity
to trade a fungible for goods or services.  That "need to know" phrase
is important here.  Identity is only important to reveal if there is a
legitimate need to know it, and if that need to know outweighs the risks
associated with the knowledge.

I think the cypherpunks recognize that by being anonymous they risk
their message being taken less seriously, but they are willing to take
the risk because most people on this list seem to evaluate the content
of the message more than the sender anyway.  Contrast this list to other
lists and you will see far fewer personality issues here because, in
part, the moderator doesn't inject his/her personality into the
discussion all the time.

No - perhaps some of the cypher punks would argue that, but certainly
not most.  Many cypherpunks use pseudonyms and we trust them to some
extent because of the repeated usage of the pseudonym.

Hogwash.  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  Names are just
conveniences created as a part of language because we are able to use
nouns to identify objects.  That guy who runs all.net is just as good as
Fred Cohen in terms of identifying me, and I rarely use my full name,
and there are otyher people in the world with exactly the same full name
as mine - even including the Dr. (a mathematician I believe).

A lot of conclusions can be made about the sender based on the content
and context of the message.

Baloney.  If someone claims to be me (likely a masochist) and I am
listening, I can identify it for all to see.  As long as the society
doesn't tollerate excessive amounts of this and fights back against the
lack of integrity, it is likely that any person who does this will be
detected.  The point here is that identity in the form of a name is only
a tag we attach for convenience of associating actions with individuals. 
It doesn't matter what the name is - I don't know the real name of
HOBBIT, but I know that s/he says a lot of sensible things.

Lies are relative things, not absolutes.  There is no "actual" system
and there never was.  Detweiler assumes that the way s/he identifies
people is the "actual" system, but that's only one perspective.  Many of
us have grown up knowing about more than one system of identities, and
apparently Detweiler missed this one.

The first error is usually the basic assumption.  This one is not a very
accurate reflection of the reality that many of us in the world live in
today.  The fact is, our political system is full of people who use one
and only one identity and have done so for their entire lives, and yet
it is jam packed with lies and crude (As well as sophistocated) attempts
at tricking people with communications.  The cypherpunks, who have far
more uses of pseudonyms have far fewer deceptions and far better
communications in my experience.  Many things that cannot be proven
are actually false.  This counterexample demostrated that Detweiler is
not just unprovable, s/he is wrong.

...

All of the confirmations Detweiler may be able to come up with can't
overwhealm the one counterexample just cited, however, I can cite many
more counterexamples.  By the way, counter to Detweiler's proposition,
plenty of scientists lie about results, and many University professors
who claim to be scientists lie about the true state of their work so
that they can propose research grants that are certain to be successes
(it is a common practice to propose work you have already completed so
as to assure that you will be successful and thus get the next grant).

I have discounted his/her thesis on the basis of its lack of accurately
predicting or reflecting reality and on no other basis.  It may be an
interesting theory, but in practice it seems to have been refuted.

So legal name changes are not allowable? Two people can't have the same
name? This doesn't map to the current reality.  It sounds more like a
government imposed identity number system - like the one in Nazi Germany
that contributed to the extermination of 6 million Jews.  I'm against it.

He said - she said.  It's just a bunch of baloney.  Lies are often the
basis for harmony and being "too honest" generally gets you very little. 
The important thing about communication is that you get other people to
think about the things you think about.  It's just a way of affecting
brain states in other entities and nothing more.  Truth, lies, and video
tape can all do this.

I appreciate Detweiler's attempt, but it's a failure (oops better try
only a partial success) because it doesn't reflect the reality.

If you can't take the heat, stay out of the chemistry lab.  I say lots
of things that people don't like and gripe about.  If Detweiler can't
shake it off and come back with something better, s/he's overly
sensitive.  What do you expect? That people will embrace your
characterization of them just because you think it's interesting? If
Detweiler is really right, then s/he should fight back with the
strongest weapons that exist in this forum - the facts.  As far as I can
see, the facts are against Detweiler, but s/he may prove me wrong in
open debate, and as far as I can tell, the cypherpunks will agree with
Detweiler if s/he is right.

On this, Detweiler is clearly incorrect from my view.

I don't want to waste further space on this.  I'm already sorry I spoke
up on it and I haven't even sent the mail yet.
