There is not "a" list ...
The list returned will be "tailored" for the calling host.
Thus an EU host will have EU sites near the front, AU hosts will have AU
servers, etc ...
(Well, maybe they'll just be returned in a random order !).

By having multiple A RRs for a name, the DNS will do the pseudo load balancing.

Indeed -- as above:
1) optimise the list so that "near" servers are used.
2) cycle the servers
3) leave it to the DNS to SHUFFLE.

Yup -- but if it's just "random", I'd probably use a single name ...

Well, the current implementation will give what it has left, then on restarting
the main loop it notices that it has no keys left, so asks the main server for
more, so if the clients aren't all bunched up, it'll pre-fetch more segments,
so there's a fair chance the client won't have to wait :-))

I can always add some more A RRs to sksp-ack to load balance ...

Possible ....

I've had various offers to host a server ...

At a cost ....

Either it has to save state in a form that's easy to reload later,
or save state in a way that it can spend some time before it starts to
	work out what it has to do [[Hmm -- I might write a script to do that]]

Loss of what info ?

Running brutessl's will call brclient to report the ACK.
They will report back the data as normal -- nothing to do with the Allocate
Slave -- even if it were, it would auto fallback to another server.

brloop's will ask for another keyspace, and on finding that the first server
on its list doesn't respond, it'll try the next server on its list, and if
none respond, it'll wait a bit and start asking again ...

Well, I use a multiplicative backoff within limits ....

Indeed -- how long ?

Well, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 300, 300, ...

Well, 5 mins ... < 1/3 or a segment ...

Yes -- I do -- so that it's possible to tie up requests and ACKs.

Yup -- that's what an ACK reflector will do.

Note that Allocation and ACKs are separate ....

I was agreeing with you ! You said:

or is the "it" in "shame it's so" not the preceding direct noun, i.e. C++? :-)))
