Not that I say this is real, but...

I can maybe understand throwing out 4 of the bits if G0 picks them up.  G1
is never used alone.

However, has anyone already noted that

	fullkey[INTEGRITY][i][j] = 0x08 ;

for all i and j?

For that matter, fullkey will be a constant for any key with all the bytes
the same.  This might constitute a class of weak keys.
