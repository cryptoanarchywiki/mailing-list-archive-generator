Could we please share snapshots of any code that exists?  Even if it's
for a totally different OS, it's still extremely helpful if we're short
on time.

I'm interested in doing/helping with Linux.  I also have access to
an SGI Indy (less well ready to develop though) and HPUX.

Does it make any sense to talk about loopback interface style wedges to
convert OS native IP to IPSEC?  What about a version of inetd that
wraps apps?

(I'm about to read the RFC's, so not sure if those suggestions make sense
yet.)

I really like the idea of using DNS for (public I assume) keys...
