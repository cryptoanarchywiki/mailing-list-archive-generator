What is your working definition of "nym server"?

Maye there's little interest because I can't find any threads that discuss
just what a "nym server" is. I can make some guesses as to what _I_ might
call a nym server, but there are some important issues (of who keeps the
records, and why a nym server is better than just using unforgeable sigs,
etc.) that need discussing.

Why should we get behind an effort that has not been spelled out or
discussed here? Maybe I'm missing the debate in the groups I deleted (see
above), but I really don't know what it's about.

Sorry, Bryan, but I don't typically join mailing lists so I can find out
what the subject of a mailing list is! :-}

Describe for us what you have in mind for "nym servers" and why they are
important, then maybe more folks will get involved.
