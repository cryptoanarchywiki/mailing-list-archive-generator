Sorry I missed the fast/soon distinction.  I've stopped the search after
searching keys starting with 0xaf down to 0xa5, and will join the group
search after I get settled in after moving to Berkeley tomorrow.  I
encourage the people who pointed their clients at me (thanks!) to stop
them, and to join the group.

In the interests of not adding a few days to the time, we should ignore
the fact that a bit of the keyspace has already been searched, and
start again.
