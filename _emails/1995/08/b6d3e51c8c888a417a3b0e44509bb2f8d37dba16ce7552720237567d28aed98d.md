	Don't know about Joel.  Might have heard one complaint over on
alt.security.pgp a month or so ago.  I just got 7 perl-rsa T-Shirts
from "wepinsto" (http://colossus.net/wepinsto/).  These were for myself,
my youngest son (16), my brother, and four friends who asked me to
order for them.  They look great!  Almost as great as the looks you
GET when people see them wondering "what the *&*r!".

	I just have one problem though...  If these things are classified
as a "munition" aka a "weapon" by da fed's how does that affect us down
here in good old Georgia where our legislature has passed a law making
it a crime to be in posession of a weapon anywhere within a hundred yards
or so of school property.  This is rather relevant for my teenager!
The school councilers looked real confused and said "Dah...  We don't
know!"  I'm suppose to talk to the man "in charge of discipline" for an
opinion on this.  As I told someone else on another mailing list, this
sounds REAL stupid but all it takes is one idiot (and we have a plentiful
supply of idiots down here in Georgia) with a wild hair and students
get expelled for silverware sitting on a car seat, tools such as tire
irons (no they weren't threating someone with one), or cultural and
cerimonial artifacts.
