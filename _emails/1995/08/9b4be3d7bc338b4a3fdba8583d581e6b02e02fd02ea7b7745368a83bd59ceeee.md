The topic has come up here several times in connection with 
development of molecular computers. It has been suggested that 
there is a link to Len Adelman's work.


But maybe that was just a transparent cover story.


Perhaps it's actually a molecular part of the Waco Vince Foster 
Tom Clancy Pat Robertson Nuclear Weapons Material divulgation.


Thanks for provoking. What do you think? Your lively 
disputations have been missed.
