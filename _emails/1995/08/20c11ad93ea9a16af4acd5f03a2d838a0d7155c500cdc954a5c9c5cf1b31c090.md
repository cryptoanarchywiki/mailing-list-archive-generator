  Why would the currency of the country be relevant to the bank? There
is no reason why banks can not calculate balances in foreign currency. A
bank could even permit "vector balances" for accounts, such as:

                               <D, F, M, Y>

representing Dollars , (Swiss) Franks, Deutschmarks, and Yen,
respectively. One could even create a "synthetic currency" set to, say,
<.25, .4, .5, 30>, and all deposits and withdrawls would be converted
accordingly. This way, if one country blows things, you don't get hit
too hard.

  ObCrypto: Well... This will involve a bit more complicated arrangement
of finances, and add in the currency-conversion thing, so it will be
even more important to have standardized means of secure communications
with your offshore bank.
