This might seem a bit long, and I'd like to apologize to the real
cypherpunks for my ranting.

You have.  I doubt it was intentional, but you have, continually.
Here are some snipets of things you've said.  First, you say that it
is a rational concern since PGP was taken over by us:

Then you talk about the MIT version as if it were the original thing:

PGP 2.0 was released in September, 1992, from Europe, and many many
people have been examining it ever since.  I truly belive that there
are no backdoors.  Does that mean the program is completely bug-free?
Hardly.  Does it mean that some attack against PGP wont be discovered
in the future?  I dont know, I'm not a diviner, I cannot forsee the
future, and I have no idea what technology will come in the future.
For all I know, someone will prove that P=NP and all this will be for
naught.

Anyways, to get back to my claims of your hurtful statements:

I DO NOT GET PAID FOR ANY WORK I DO ON PGP!  I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A
DIME FOR MY WORK.  I WORK ON PGP BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN IT.  Having said
that, I cannot BELIEVE you would have the Balls to say that the NSA
has bought me.  Go re-read what you've said.  You have just said that
the MIT PGP team, through MIT, is bound to be covering something up
because of historical fact.  

I have never said "Believe me when I said PGP is secure".  I have
continually asked for you to check on the security yourself.  But you
have continually refused to do that, and asked why it is secure!  So,
you refuse to look for yourself, and you refuse to believe it when you
are told.  So, what the hell do you want?  Do you want a line-by-line
examination of the code????  Sheesh!

You're right, which is why the source code is publically available.  I
would wholeheartedly agree with you if only binaries are shipped, but
the source is available.  Anyone can look through and verify the code.
Anyone can try to find weaknesses.  In fact, everyone is encouraged to
do so.  I don't see how _this_ "violates the fundamental principles of
information protection".

I think I've finally figured out where you are completely confused!!!
You are confusing "back door" with "bug".  FYI: A back door is usually
a means to make it easy for someone to get into a system.  For
example, if I put in code so that I could read every PGP message by
typing the passphrase "Setec Astronomy", that would be a backdoor.
The fact that httpd was exploitable, or sendmail holes, or etc. are
BUGS, not Back doors.

Your problem is that you are using these terms interchangably.  THEY
ARE NOT THE SAME.  Putting in a backdoor has the connotation of
intent.  A bug is an accidental occurrance that was a side effect of
poor coding, a typo, carelessness, confusion, inconsistency, etc.  A
back door, on the other hand, is a DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR
CIRCUMVENT SECURITY!

Oh?  It doesnt?  How can you say that?  In what way does it not do
this?  The RFC states, in your quote, that "existing hardware on many
systems can be used" for truly random hardware techniques.  Please,
substantiate your claim that PGP does not do this.  Show me code
segments which show it does not.  Show me an analysis that goes
contrary to the RFC.

You're right, it should not be blindly trusted.  Go read the code and
examine the algorithms to prove to yourself that it is secure.  I've
done that to the extent that I wish, and I believe it is secure.  But
you wont take my word for it, so go ahead and check!  Oh, wait, you
wont do that either.  Sorry.  I forgot.

Show me some proof that PGP is "probably not secure"?  Come on, there
is a finite probability that I can walk through a wall!  The laws of
quantum probablility give me this finite probability!  But I'd be hard
pressed to show you that I can walk through the wall.  It looks good
on paper, but it just ain't gonna happen.

As for the RFC, it does not refute that PGP is secure.  In fact, PGP
pretty much follows the RFCs guidelines.  You clearly have selective
reading.  A useful skill -- I should learn it.

Dont forget that you have to run PGP in some OS.  Please show me a
secure OS!  Given that the OS cannot be secure (using your logic it is
intuitively obvious that this is true) then how can you ask to see a
program any more secure than the enviornment in which it runs?  PGP
tries to be as secure as possible given the environment in which it is
being run.

No, your concerns have been utterly vague.  The closest you've come to
being at all specific is some vague notion of analyzing keystrokes.
In every message I've responded to, I've asked you to expand upon what
you mean.  What kind of analysis do you mean?  How do you propose to
analyze keystroke timings?  Even if you have a probabalistic model of
keystroke timings, all you can possibly do is compare two different
probabilities to see if they are the same.  But that doesn't help you
limit the search on keys.

> If the people at MIT feel personally insulted because I have questioned

I'm not insulted that you are questioning PGP.  I am insulted because
in every message you have sent, you have postulated some conspiracy
with the government or postulated some intentional weakening of PGP.
Your statements could almost be construed as libelous, which is why I
feel insulted.  I feel extremely comfortable with people questioning
the security of PGP.  What I dont like is someone stating that it is
not secure, slaiming some sort of back door (which connotes some
intent to reduce the security) and does not back up the claim with any
proof.

> 	example of how it could be insecure.

And I've asked to you explain your conjecture, which you have
constantly either refused to do or intentionally ignored.

No matter what, PGP's security is based upon the security of RSA,
which in turn is based upon the difficult of factoring, which has
never been proven to be hard.  Therefore, there is always the
possibility that someone will find a polynomial factoring algorithm
which would completely destroy any security in PGP.

Ok.  Please explain what kind of keystroke timing analysis you
propose, and I will attempt to answer that, or concede your point.

Have you heard the thought experiment of putting a back-door in login
by modifying the C compiler to modilgy the C compiler to modify login?
Think about that in terms of the security of PGP -- you are always
going to be limited in security to the security of the system on which
you are running.

I only believe you are being unscholarly because you are making claims
without any supporting evidence.  _THAT_ is unscholarly!  

Now, if you are asking if PGP is completely bug free, I will be the
first to admit that it is not.  I am certain that there are latent
bugs in the code (and there are many that have been fixed since the
2.6.2 release).  However that has not been your statement nor your
questions.  You have asked about back doors, an intentional act to
reduce the security, and to that I vehemently say that there are none.

How do I know that you haven't been infected by a computer virus?
Perhaps there was a computer virus that flashed subliminal messages on
your screen to make you think you were L. Detweiler and think that
Desert Storm was the greatest thing since sliced bread?  Improbable?
Perhaps, but prove to me that this didn't happen!  How do you know
that Microsoft Windows doesn't send all your keystrokes to Bill Gates
for him to peruse?  Prove to me that we landed on the moon!  Some have
contended that it was all a hoax.  Prove to me that the universe
existed before I was concious of it.  How do I know that you exist?
Perhaps all this is a dream -- and if so, I sure hope to god I wake up
soon.

Good night.
