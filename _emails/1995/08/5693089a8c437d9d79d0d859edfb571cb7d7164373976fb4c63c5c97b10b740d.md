No. Bypassing anecdotes about personal experiences with some .au cpunks, why
should I trust *anyone* to certify that code is auto runnable on my machine?
In secure or commercial networks, the onus is on making sure holes are not
opened up in the defences.

To me, having all these crypto links, digital envelopes, crypto filesystems,
etc all mean zero if you start offering to run code blindly from anyone.

Next.

The above opinions are rumoured to be mine.
