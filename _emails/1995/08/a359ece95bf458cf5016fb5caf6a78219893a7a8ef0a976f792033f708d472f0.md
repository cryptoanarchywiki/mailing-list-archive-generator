Wouldn't this result in the slaves higher in the list being hammered?
Perhaps you want to do something simular to what the later releases of 
bind do with machines with multiple names, and round robin the list.
If you had a list with hosts A, B, and C, the first request would get
ABC, the next BCA, the next CAB, and the next back to ABC.  That would
distrubute the work between the slaves a bit better.

Actually this is what I meant, that they would ask for it.  My idea would
be that when a slave is asked for keyspace, if they don't have enough
they'd ask for the next large chunk.  That way the central server doesn't
ever have to deal with small requests.

Quite right.  I'd assume that the first level list of slaves would be controlled
by you.  If you're careful enough a slave should be able to go down and come
back up without losing any state at all.  All brutes/slaves talking to it
should be able to continue on with no loss of information.  I would put 
an exponential backoff on the time between retries for the brutes talking
to the slaves as well as the slaves talking to the master.  (With a limit
for the amount of backoff of course.)  If you can't talk to someone you
might sleep for 8 seconds and retry, if you still couldn't back off to 16,
the 32, then 64, then 128, etc...the maximum might be somewhere around ten
or fifteen minutes, so that within ten or fifteen minutes of crashing and
being restarted everything would be humming along with no manual intervention
required on any of the lower levels.

That's a good point.  If you want to keep track of who has what, it all has
to get back to the root eventually.  If you use my idea of having the
slaves cache the information until the next time they'd be contacting the
root anyway, (or whenever the timer elapses,) then you greatly cut down
on the number of small packets seen by the root, (and each level of slaves
when their's a hierarchy).

<snicker;>  Sound like we could have a religious war if we wanted, but this
isn't the right list for it:)  (sigh;) Maybe we should move this portion of
the discussion to alt.my.favorite.language.rules.and.yours.of.course.sucks.
I'm not really a snob about it...I still think cobol's great for some 
purposes, I just prefer coding in C++.
