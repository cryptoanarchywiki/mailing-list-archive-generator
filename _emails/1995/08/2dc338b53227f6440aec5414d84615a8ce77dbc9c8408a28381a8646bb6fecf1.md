Soon.  No.  And not yet.

Yes confusion abound.  Dead mailer for me, Piete away for a while
(back now).  Rest assured big announce of a deadline when it is fixed,
with plenty of warning.

Perhaps a start time of day which is more convenient would be better,
also for people using WWW, few likely to be around at 6AM, perhaps
later in the day, when the time is decided.

Yes, correct.  For people with the unix client, this means they can
leave the client running already, and it will sleep in 1hr chunks,
until there is something on the server to do.

Okay will do.
