I think that any Perry bashing can be taken offline.  I don't think that 700
people subscribed to the "I Hate Perry Metzger" list; they subscribed to
cypherpunks.

If you have anything to say to Perry, tell him in private e-mail. Don't post
a milion lines of shit to the list.

Get a clue folks...

Brad
