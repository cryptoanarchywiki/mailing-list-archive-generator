Excuse me - what the f**k is this?  Does it bear some truth in it
or is it just a bad joke? If it is not a joke where to get the damn
text - thanks. Sorry for the language but this does  sound just
the thing I have heard some rumours of and which certainly
would result in banning strong crypto.
