Saw this on usenet. Figured someone might want to give it a spin...

Subject: Announce>128 bit RC4 SSL available outside US

We have now updated our servers to

a) Use 128 bit SSL if the client allows it.
b) Tell users which cipher is being used on a secure session.

To experiment point your secure client at one of the following:

https://193.118.187.101/
https://193.118.187.102/
https://193.118.187.105/
https://193.118.187.111/

(the main server does not run SSL to minimise PK calculations)

If you do not have a client that can use 128 bit RC4 then
ftp://193.119.26.70/mktnet/pub/horse.zip
does to the job, but is quite flaky otherwise.
