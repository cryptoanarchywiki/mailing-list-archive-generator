I urge all those interested in quantum computers to consult the CP
archives. Also, my FAQ has a couple of pages on it. Grep for the main
topic, or for Shor.

This comes up every 3-4 months and produces the same speculations.

I think nanotech and quantum computers have even less to do with real
concerns than Waco and Foster do.
