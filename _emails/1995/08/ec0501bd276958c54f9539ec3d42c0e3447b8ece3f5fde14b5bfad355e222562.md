Citibank Theft


New York (AP) -- Russian computer hackers broke into a Citibank
electronic money transfer system and stole more than $10 
million
before they were caught, according to newly-unsealed court
documents. The money was shifted from Citibank to accounts in
Finland, Russia, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States,
Israel and Switzerland, FBI agent Steven Garfinkel said. 
Citibank
said six people have been arrested in the scheme and that none 
of
its clients lost money.
