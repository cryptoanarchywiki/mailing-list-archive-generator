Only if you use RSA.  One of the neat things about RSA, as opposed to DH or 
DSA/DSS, is that the same algorithm can do both signature and encryption.

Once we all have our Gummint-issue Citizen-Unit SmartCards with the
Web-Of-Mistrust Hierarchical Certification System, 
people won't be able to use the DSS feature to send you encrypted messages 
        <fnord>Pay no attention to that man behind the subliminal
channel!</fnord>
but you can still use them for signatures, including checking escrow agency 
signatures on your privacy key.
