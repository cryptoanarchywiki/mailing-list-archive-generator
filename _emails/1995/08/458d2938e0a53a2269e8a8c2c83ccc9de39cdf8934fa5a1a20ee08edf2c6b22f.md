Science fiction writer John Brunner died last Friday, August 25, from
a massive stroke, while attending the World Science Fiction Convention
in Glasgow, Scotland.

Among several other notable works, Brunner was the author of THE SHOCKWAVE
RIDER, a groundbreaking vision of the information age that inspired and
forsaw much that was pertinent to the Internet in general and the
Cypherpunks in particular.

Let us pause a moment to note his passing and honor his life and
contributions.
