-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Mailcrypt version 3.3 is now available.

Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
to message encryption with PGP.  (You do use Emacs to handle your mail
and news, right?)

Features: Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting
keys, passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
(including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.

*We* think it's the best interface to these functions anywhere, but
then again, we're biased.

The NEWS file is appended to this message.

Obtain it through the Mailcrypt home page at

	http://cag-www.lcs.mit.edu/mailcrypt/

or from the FTP mirror at

	ftp://cag.lcs.mit.edu/pub/patl/

and enjoy!

======================================================================

Noteworty changes in Mailcrypt version 3.3:

Numerous minor bugs have been fixed.

Mailcrypt now requires at least FSF Emacs version 19.28 or XEmacs
version 19.12.  Sorry, but anything else is too annoying.

Support has been added for reading mail under (ding) GNUS.



Noteworthy changes in Mailcrypt version 3.2:

Mailcrypt now uses "start-process" instead of "call-process-region" to
run PGP; this uses a pipe instead of a temp file for various inputs,
including your passphrase.  Ahem.

All Mailcrypt commands now start with the prefix `C-c /' to bring
Mailcrypt into line with documented GNU standards.

`mc-insert-public-key' is now bound to `C-c / x' (an in "extract")
instead of `C-c a'.

`mc-deactivate-passwd' is bound to `C-c / f' (as in "forget").

`mc-read-mode' and `mc-write-mode' are now full-blown minor modes.  So
you can do, for example, `M-x mc-install-write-mode' from a Text mode
buffer and have the normal encryption and signing commands available.
The keymaps for the modes are configurable variables.

Interactive commands `mc-encrypt-region', `mc-sign-region', etc. are
now defined.

If you use RMAIL and you say no to "Replace encrypted message with
decrypted?", you will be dropped into RMAIL mode for viewing.

RMAIL summary mode is now supported.

Documentation in the form of a Texinfo file is now part of the
distribution.

Mailcrypt can now fetch a needed key from finger, HTTP, or any of a
list of locally stored keyrings.  `C-c / k' initiates a fetch
manually; Mailcrypt will offer to initiate one automatically as
appropriate during encryption or signature verification.

The remailer functions now support Mixmaster.

`C-c / d' can handle conventionally encrypted messages.
