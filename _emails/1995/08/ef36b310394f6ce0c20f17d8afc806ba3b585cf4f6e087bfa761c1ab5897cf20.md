Except that it all starts with language and developes through set theory.

And yet it is all based on observations at the initial set theoretic level.

And indded, we are people which gives us some common context.

I was taught 1+1=1 in boolean algebra.

But in computers, we are living in a mathematically defined system
(except for physical issues which have been suppressed to a very large
extent by the design of statistically low error-rate systems) which
follows very precisely the logic of its design.  Thus proofs work since
we are working in this well formed domain.

More specifically, within the logic dictated by the hardware designed to assure
that the system remains within the mathematical structure defined by its design.
