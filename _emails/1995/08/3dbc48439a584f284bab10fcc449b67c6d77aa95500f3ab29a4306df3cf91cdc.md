Associated Press reported on August 10, 1995:
 
President Won't Resign But...

(WASHINGTON)

President Clinton wasn't about to give a serious 
answer when he was asked Thursday if he might resign. 

The question came from veteran columnist Sarah McClendon, who asserted 
that some legislators from the left and right were trying to push him 
out of office.

[...]

"Well, if you promise to run off with me I might," Clinton responded,
... "But otherwise, I can't think of any reason."

Repeat after me:

There's nothing to those crazy conspiracy theories.
There's nothing to those crazy conspiracy theories.....
