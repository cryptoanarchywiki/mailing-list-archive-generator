This isn't directly relevant to crypto, but it is a scheme to allow people
to filter out unwanted media content.  Has anyone heard of it, and does
anyone know how it works? 

This is from TV Guide:

CHEERS to commercial-free TV, or more exactly, Commercial Advance VCRs.  
Check it out:  this month, RCA will unveil a VCR that skips past 
virtually all commercials during playback of a recorded show.  Imagine:  
three minutes of commercials will whiz by in 10 seconds.  The downside?  
This summer, commercials may be the most interesting things on network 
tv.
