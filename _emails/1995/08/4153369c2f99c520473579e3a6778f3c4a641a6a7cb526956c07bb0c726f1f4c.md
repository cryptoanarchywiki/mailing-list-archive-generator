Are there any gateways that will take a (pgp-encrypted) type 1 message,
with presumably some kind of headers giving onward routing information and
put it into the type 2 network?

Should there be such a service? I think this was discussed earlier, but
Lance's statement above seems to reopen the discussion.

What is the total daily volume of mixmaster traffic for all the advertised
mixmasters? Has anyone measure this statistic?
