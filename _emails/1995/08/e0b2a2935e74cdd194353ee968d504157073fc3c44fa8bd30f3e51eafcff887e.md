I got a copy mailed to me directly as well. I don't know why he/she/it sent
it me, but I got it.

I have nothing further to add on this. But recall that it was just about
this time last year--just before Crypto--that the "alleged RC4 code" was
posted anonymously to the list.

Hmmhhh....

Special note: My ISP has changed its domain name from "sensemedia.net" to
"got.net" (as in "got milk?"), so I have to again ask you all to bear with
me and use my new e-mail address, "tcmay@got.net".
