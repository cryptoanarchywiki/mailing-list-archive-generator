On the contrary, it is *precisely* correct as I have phrased it.

Check my phrasing again.  Note the use of "in principle".

Whether the principle applies in practice is certainly a matter for
debate.  I would point out that 1) PGP is hardly well written code,
and 2) many current cryptographic algorithms make ideal places for
concealing all sorts of things.

Sorry, I can't resist.  From "md5.c" in the PGP distribution:

/*
 * Start MD5 accumulation.  Set bit count to 0 and buffer to mysterious
 * initialization constants.
 */
void MD5Init(struct MD5Context *ctx)
{
...


(Note: Of course I don't think that MD5 has a back door, but that has
more to do with my trust of Rivest than the fact the algorithm is
public.)

By "cleanly written code", I presume you mean code which is either
formally proven to be a correct implementation, or code which is so
transparent that it is "obviously" a correct implementation.  PGP's
random number generator is neither.

Moreover, as I precisely mentioned, the algorithms themselves can
conceal back doors.  This has plenty to do with public key
cryptography.  A reduction proof from a known hard problem would make
this virtually impossible, but there is no such proof for PGP's random
number generator.  (Nor for any other algorithm used by PGP, although
I admit RSA comes close.)
