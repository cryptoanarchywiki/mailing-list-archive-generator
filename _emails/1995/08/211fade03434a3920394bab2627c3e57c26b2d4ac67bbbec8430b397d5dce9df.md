A while back someone mentioned that they would be videocasting a 
Cypherpunks meeting over the MBONE.

While the MBONE is great for many of us, CU-SeeMe would provide a much 
larger audience.

Check out http://www.umich.edu/~dschluss/nv-cusm.html for information on 
how to forward MBONE video to a CU-SeeMe reflector.
