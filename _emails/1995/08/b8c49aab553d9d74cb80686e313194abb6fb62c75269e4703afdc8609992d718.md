I read in the New York Times that a lot of fundamentalist Christians fear 
the e-cash revolution because they believe that eventually everyone will 
be required to bear a tattooed bar code on their right hand which 
would contain all a person's information:  name, d.o.b., birthplace, 
etc.  Such a tattoo would also be used to deduct e-cash from a person's 
"account" when they made purchases.  It's still a bit of a stretch; 
they're using the book of Revelations to back up this theory.
