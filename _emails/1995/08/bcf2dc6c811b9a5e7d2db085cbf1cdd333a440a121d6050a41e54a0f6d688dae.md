Peter Shank said a lot of things I agree with in his response to Damien
Doligez' break of an SSL/RC4-40 transaction, and one thing that seems to
miss the point.

However, the cost of breaking it to Doligez was essentially nil.  The
machines to which he had access were otherwise idle, and no other users
were competing for them.  The virtually simultaneous break by David Byers
in the team led by Adam Back was the same: idle cycles.  In fact, Byers
was delayed because a real project needed cycles on that machine.

I would hazard a guess that 90% of the compute cycles in the world are used
running screen savers... this gives a <lot> of slack for people who would
like to harness them to perform productive work like making points about
the strength of security.

I would have to say the marginal value of compute cycles is approximately
$0 until enough compute hogs come along to eat from the idle cycle trough.

Absolutely.  It's incredibly annoying that companies like Netscape who
understand how to get good transaction security have to settle for "almost
good enough" -- the computing cost of the extra security is almost nil.

Yes!

Yes, but with idle cycles contributed by volunteers the decryption time
on a single RC4-40 message can very likely be reduced to a day or so at
no marginal cost to owners of existing machines... which is the whole point.

Cracking weak crypto is free, and can be combatted only by implementing
strong crypto.
