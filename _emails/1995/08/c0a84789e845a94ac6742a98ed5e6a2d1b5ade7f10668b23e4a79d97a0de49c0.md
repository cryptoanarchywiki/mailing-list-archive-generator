I just spent an hour surfing the various crypto/cypherpunks web sites. In
this hour I did not come across a single non-US site that carried anything
else but PGP. Most non-US sites just carry rants about the evil ITAR, and
a few carry the various international versions of PGP. That's it. I know
that there are several European ftp sites that have other cryptographic
software as well, but I sure as hell can't find them by browsing the web.
One would think that at lest some of the major homepages (Virtual library,
etc) carry links to such sites. Who cares if someone violates ITAR, if
overseas users can't find the exported software?
