Then you didn't clarify very well; to wit:

The first paragraph clarifies nothing because it is dead wrong; the
second because it is arrogant, offensive, and dead wrong.

 wilcoxb> From this perspective, the Web of Trust is the soul of
 wilcoxb> public-key cryptography.  From the other perspective ("Never

The Web of Trust is a means of thwarting active attacks;
nothing more, nothing less.  "Perspective" has nothing to do with it.

Given that active attacks are hard to explain and understand fully,
the PGP docs are correct to advocate a conservative approach to
signing keys.  Novices *should* be taught to take the Web of Trust
seriously.  (Yes, I am retracting my own statements quoted above; the
more I think about it, the more I think it is very hard to teach a
novice the details of active attacks.)

Moreover, I suspect that active attacks are more likely today than
when those docs were written, which makes their advice precisely the
opposite of an "anachronism".
