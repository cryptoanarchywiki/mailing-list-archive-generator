A couple of people have indicated that they did not see the original
posting.  I changed the subject heading in my followup.  The original
message was posted under the subject title, "this looked like it might
be interesting".  At least one person had commented on the similarity
to Skipjack which is what prompted me to look at it a little more
closely.
