While not every telephone, every telephone switch is required
to be tap capable  - The Digital Telephony Act.  Note there is
provision for the government to pay costs for Telcos to make 
their phones tappable - as yet unfunded by Congress.

The rights of The People have clearly collided with the interests
of Law Enforcement.  Guess who Congress likes better?
