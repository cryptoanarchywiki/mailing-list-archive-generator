Finding the mail mixed in there is evidence that supports the "charge" 
but surely can be rebutted.  When I was practicing in a small town c. 
1984, people would be summoned (sent a paper telling them to show up) to 
court for illegal dumping if their mail was found with other trash, old 
refrigerators, etc., in a creek somewhere.  Those charged could always 
put on proof that Billy Bob's garbage service picked up their trash ...

The sentence was almost always to go and pick up some multiple of the 
garbage found and take it to the landfill.

No on was ever "busted" in the way I think of it -- arrested.

I guess NY doesn't have as much serious crime as I thought!
