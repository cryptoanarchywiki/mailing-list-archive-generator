The World Wide Web Consortium is holding a Workshop on payments. The workshop
is intended to be a small, technically oriented meeting of its payments working
group. Although it is a members only event I am willing to listen to special
pleading, alternatively companies may wish to join the consortium at our
extreemely reasonable rates. See http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Consortium/ for
details.

W3C is making progress on supporting electronic payments on the web. This WG
Meeting has been called to foster discussion and feedback between W3C and
its members. Discussion will focus on proposals to the W3C for payment
protocols, interfaces, and e-commerce support.

The agenda for the electronic payment workshop is still being settled. At
the current time we have confirmed presentations by VISA, IBM, W3C, and the
Financial Services Technical Consortium (FSTC). Additional invitations have
been issued, and suggestions for additional presentations would be welcome.
Contact Phillip Hallam-Baker (hallam@w3.org) or Jim Miller (JMiller@w3.org)
with suggestions.

There is a separate W3C Security WG Meeting at MIT on Tuesday, October 10th.
