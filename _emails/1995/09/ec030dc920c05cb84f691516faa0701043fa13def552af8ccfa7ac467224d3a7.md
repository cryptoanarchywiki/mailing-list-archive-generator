Nope they don't the Democratic party aides do that type of work from Democrat 
HQ.

The President gets a once a week summary of all the mail he gets including the 
email.  I think they also provide a daily press digest.

By monitoring Lytel was probably thinking about installing net sniffers etc or 
obtaining the data from the FBI or whoever. I am certain he didn't mean to say 
that he does not surf the net ever and does not occasionaly visit opposition 
sites. 

The term monitor implies an organised search and continuous checking proceedure
the number of hits cited sounds more like somone passed round the URL of a kook
site inside the office.
