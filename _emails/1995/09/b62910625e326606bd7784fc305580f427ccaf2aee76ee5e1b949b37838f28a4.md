I've just updated the archives (http://www.hks.net/cpunks/index.html).  To
bring everybody up to date on what's happening:

Hypermail simply isn't up to this size of an archive.  All sorts of bugs
are coming out into the open, so I've been implementing a system designed
for large archives.  Alas, reality has intruded and I haven't had the time
to finish it.

So, I'll be updating the archives by hand from time to time until I can get
the new system on line.  Sorry 'bout that, folks, but you get what you pay
for.
