My assumption ws that if we conservatively counted at least 300 bits of entropy,
we would have 128 for sure. Not very scientific,

Did that. It talks about a lot of the pitfalls. Unfortunately it does not address
(nor can it realistically be expected to address) details of what to look for
on a particular version of an OS running on some particular platform.

Gee, I thought I pointed out that we were putting that code in as part of
the going idle.

I don't know, but I'll forward this on to our PC guys. It might be a portability
problem.

We try to be careful about dealing with the subprocess failing to run.

We are constantly trying to improve this area of our code. We are still taking
suggestions.

By the way, the security engineers are doing what we can to make sure that we
can expose as much of the seed generation algorithms as possible. There is a
chance we can get permission to post the code.

It doesn't hurt. It's also information that is not available to the external
evesdropper. Other than execution time, why should I remove it from the list
of bits being fed into the hash? Successfully getting this information probably
involves physical access to the machine.

We will check this one out also. For the really low resolution clocks, the
answer will be zero most of the time. :-)

I agree, but I have a hard arguing with those that asser that the security
of UNIX is weak enough that given what we are doing for the patch it will
be easier to become root from a logged in account than to hack the seed.
