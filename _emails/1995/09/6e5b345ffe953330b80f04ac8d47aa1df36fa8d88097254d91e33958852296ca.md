Congrats, nice job!

The Netscape license explicitly prohibits decompiling (except where such
prohibition is illegal).  When this hits the media it will be important
to avoid being tarred with the "hacker breaks rules and breaks in" brush.
More subtly, it's probably a bad idea to call into question the overall
business model of client binaries on the net.

Instead, emphasize importance of open code, public reviews, ability to
link in your own code that meets public specs, etc.  All of these things
the Internet was designed to do, and U.S. ITAR regulations are designed
to prohibit (globally, anyway).  And also that the bad guys will never
play by the rules.  And re-emphasize that solutions are possible, just
that the U.S. government prevents them from being deployed in a global
economy.

Perhaps draw parallels to the recent Microsoft Word virus.
