Suppose you divide your random material into several parts:

A: Userinput (updated from Keystroke timing etc.)
B: 'Random' numbers from remote server
C: Time, pid, ppid, etc..
D: other...

Whenever you want to incorporate new data into B you could do something like:
B = B xor Hash (A,B,C,D, fresh 'random')

This would be very hard to pollute with well chosen input.
