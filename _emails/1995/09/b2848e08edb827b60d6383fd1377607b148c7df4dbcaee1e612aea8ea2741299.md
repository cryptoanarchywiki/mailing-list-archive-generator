I an immediate need of info on the liabilities of BSD type systems, and in
particular the BorderWare products.

I heard that in the BorderWare product itself, there are several  recently
discovered potential "holes"...

I have a particular interest in both the Attack MO against the BSD
platforms in general and the Border products in particular...

Please do not send the reply to the lists but to me personally
(todd@lgt.com). I will summarize if I get enough info to be worth the
effort.

Any comments?

Thanks In Advance...
