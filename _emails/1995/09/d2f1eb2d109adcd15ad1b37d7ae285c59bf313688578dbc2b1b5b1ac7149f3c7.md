I enjoy Easter Eggs in general, and I agree that a program with fun stuff
like this in it gives one a warm fuzzy feeling about the relaxed management
style at the company that produces it.  On the other hand, of all kinds of
mass market software, network-aware software needs to have the most trust
from the users, because it alone has the capability of passing information
out of your machine.  My preference is always to have source code
available for security-critical functions so that I can verify that it's
not only doing what I want, but also doing nothing that I don't want.

For a program like Netscape it doesn't make sense to supply source code,
of course, and the Easter Eggs already provide some evidence that it's
doing something that I didn't "buy" (assuming I've bought it, of course).
From there it's a short step to the questions "What else is it doing that
I didn't pay for?  Reading my PGP key generation environment?
Interesting.  What else?"
