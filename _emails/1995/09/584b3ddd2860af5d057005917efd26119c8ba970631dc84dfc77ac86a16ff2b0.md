I was pointing out that it was possible.  I was not trying to make the point
that there was any *USE* for such a thing.  (Evidently some ID cards now
carry such prints. California does, if memory serves me correctly.)

Just because something is silly does not mean it will not be tried by
someone in law enforcement.  In fact, there seems to be a corelation between
silly acts and law enforcement...  (Or at least those making the rules about
law enforcement.)  And if you think it cannot get any worse, Pete "I want to
seal the borders" Wilson has announced he is running for president.  We will
be getting a large number of silly laws and pronouncements if the American
people are stupid enough to elect him to high office.
