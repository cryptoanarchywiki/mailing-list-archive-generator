Oh please!  Some clerk browses the internet and you don't want to respect
their privacy because of the IRS?  This makes sense how?  I suppose that
you're going to dig up information about me and spread it around the 
internet because you have issues about the company I work for?

Suppose someone did something bad to you and justified it by saying that
harvard is an elitist school that once did something bad to their uncle.
