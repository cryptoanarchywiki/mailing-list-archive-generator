[...]
One could define some kind of new metrics let dp(x) shortest number of
hops to go from page x to any "porn" (sexy) page,
Now, I bet that dp(x) < infinity for any page x that have links on
their site that goes outside their site, thanks to the "strange
attractor" represented by search engines & index, which are the most
linked pages

<dp(x)> (mean dp) is prolly around 4 or 5

For instance, what is the pornography distance of whitehouse ? 
Without complete search, their dp(http://www.whitehouse.gov/)<=7 :

-> textual representation of this page.  {sorry, i had to go there,using lynx}
http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/html/White_House_Home-plain.html
-> Executive Branch
(http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/EOP/html/3_parts-plain.html)
-> government information locator service (GILS)
(http://info.er.usgs.gov/gils/index.htm)
-> IMAGINATION NEEDED HERE!
(http://www.usgs.gov/public/gils/imagine.html)
-> [Other Topics]   {lots of remote pointers, but lots of outdated links too}
(http://www.usgs.gov/public/gils/other.html)
-> Another List of Internet Search facilities {netscape's search page}
(http://home.mcom.com/home/internet-search.html)
Search for "playboy" for instance at infoseek, or anything in
fact... (btw where is that fast playboy's mirror ?)
-> sexy pages!
