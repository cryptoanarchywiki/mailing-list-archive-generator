Sure, I found the above offensive.  It comes across in exactly the same
tone as a cop saying, "Please step away from the car."  I know it's silly,
but sometimes Please just isn't enough.  The simple change:

      but the key was not there.  Could you please mail me your key?  Thanks.

works miracles:)  The tone on the rest of it was nice.  You have to be careful
with imperatives.  They usually sound mean...even with a please at the front.
