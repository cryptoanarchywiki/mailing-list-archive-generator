It wasn't taken as one... I quite agree with your description of the text
in question as "drivil" (though I wouldn't have spelled it quite that way).
We probably shouldn't judge without context, but I hear the context is
of the same intelectual quality anyway.

I should have been clearer; that "accused" is not of stupidity, but of
posting a) allegedly trade secret material 
        b) allegedly copyright material allegedly in excess of fair use.

For which you have no proof and in fact have reason to believe otherwise etc.

By the way, starrd, why don't you sign your posts?
You obviously have PGP...


Hope this is less ambiguous than my previous post :-)
