	Have you tried an 'INSTALL=' line in the CONFIG.SYS to load
the drive's TSR first?  INSTALL is a rarely-documented feature for the
CONFIG.SYS to load a TSR during its processing.  I believe it also
saves memory by not loading some sort of header to into memory (DOS
PSP maybe?), which may also cause a problem.  Can't hurt to try
though, eh?
