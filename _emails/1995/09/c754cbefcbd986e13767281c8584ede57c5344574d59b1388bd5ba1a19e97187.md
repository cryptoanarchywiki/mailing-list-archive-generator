There are two important differences.

The first difference is in ownership of the data.  If the source of the
link decides to clobber the file, then the fact that I have a page with the
URL does not guarantee access to that file for the user of *my* page.
Similarly, the person owning the file can freely change the content of the
file, without my changing the URL which points to it.

The other difference is in handling of the data.  If the link were to
a pornographic image and someone were to access it through my page's URL,
the bits of that image would never touch my computer.

Meanwhile, <a href="http://dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/rsa/"> RSA encryption system
in PERL </a> might be a URL which violates US export laws -- if this
interpretation were to be taken -- but if so, does it violate them in this
mail message?  That depends, I suppose, on whether your mail agent is aware
of URLs and turns them into point-and-click units.  Is it a violation if
the URL is printed in a paper magazine?  After all, it's the convenience of
the web browser which is at issue.  One can invoke netscape with or
without a parameter.

Yes -- interesting legal times ahead.
