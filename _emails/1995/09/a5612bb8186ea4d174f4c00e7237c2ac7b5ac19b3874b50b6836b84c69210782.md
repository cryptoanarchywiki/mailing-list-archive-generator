RSA will give out certificates to individuals; Apple includes a coupon for a 
free one with their MacOS 7.5 (and 7 Pro) release.  There's a program for the 
Mac (RIPEM Mac) that will convert the keys returned into RIPEM usable 
PEM-format keys.  Isn't that what SSL uses?

The only question is what CAs are supported by the browser....  I think the 
Apple keys are under RSA's Unaffiliated User CA...

If there's interest, I'll look further into this.
