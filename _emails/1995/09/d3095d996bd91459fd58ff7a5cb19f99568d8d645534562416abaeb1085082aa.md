Certainly, Orlin's postings are of primary interest to everyone.  Perhaps 
the White House Staff needs a new fiction writer for the next State of 
the Union address!!  :-)

Your scoop related to net monitoring, not posting.  I anxiously await 
your sequel. And so what if they did post.  Maybe you are concerned about 
anonymous posting from the Administration???

And technically speaking, I guess, I am part of the Administration as an 
employee of the Executive Branch with some discretion in how I do my job. 
In the same sense, I was a part of Bush's Administration.

Having had two rounds of off topic posting on this thread, I intend to 
give you the last word.  I hope I can resist posting in response to what 
I am sure will be a thoughtful and enlightening reply.
