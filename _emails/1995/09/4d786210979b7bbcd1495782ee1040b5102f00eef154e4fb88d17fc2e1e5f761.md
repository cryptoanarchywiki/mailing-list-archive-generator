I don't think it would provide much more security, but it might keep you
ISP from logging the mail. If you are using mixmaster@remail.obscura.com as
your remailer, you are welcome to use it as the mail host for that mail.
It is a slow connection so please do not use is as your regular mail host.

You should try the telnet port 25 trick. It is amazingly simple (but not
secure). Just "telnet some.machine.com 25" and type help. It will guide you
through it. It is quite informative.
