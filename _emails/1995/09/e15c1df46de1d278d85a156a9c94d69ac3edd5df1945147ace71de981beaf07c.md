It could also be argued that the number of busts and wire taps will go up 
dramatically as more and more people begin to use communications in more 
integrated ways with thier life and career.  It is kind of a fallacy, but
communications does seem to be a rapidly growing market.  I imagine the folks
who push for that sort of crap are thinking of the future, else we'd already 
have it.
