People seem to think this kind of thing is obviously safe.  I'm not yet
convinced.

By xoring in a quantity *chosen by your adversary*, you're essentially
allowing related-key attacks on your stream cipher.  (Your PRNG is just
a stream cipher, keyed with my_seed.)

Noone knows how secure most ciphers are against related-key attacks:
related-key attacks are known to be very powerful (often more powerful
than any other type); but very little research on this topic is available.
You're treading on unknown ground.



There's the also a small error in your specific algorithm.  Let
	 n = stop_bit - start_bit;
presumably n is much less than the length of your seed.  Then a brute-force
search over n bits will recover n bits of the seed -- this is a much faster
cryptanalysis than a brute force over all bits of the seed.  This can
probably be fixed by something like
	MD5(select_bits(MD5(my_seed))) -> remote,
but the related-key uncertainties still remain.
