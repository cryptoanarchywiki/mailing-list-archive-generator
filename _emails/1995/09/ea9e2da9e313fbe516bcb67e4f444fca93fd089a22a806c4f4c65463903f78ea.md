 The bug causes random things to happen because it trashes the stack. I
just did a test with http://aaaaaaa.(repeat pattern 42 times, followed by
5 a's), that's 341 characters in the domain. After a coredump, I inspected
the stack, and it has been trashed to hell, including the PC register
which was 0x61616161 (or 'aaaa' in ascii)

THIS IS A SERIOUS BUG!


Unlike the SSL crack (which took a supercomputer to crack), or
the RNG (which doesn't affect many people since there is not much
internet commerce actually going on), this bug has the potential
to damage millions of computers! This is almost enough to scare me
away from using netscape. You can guard yourself by always observing
the URL you are about to click on, but how many people will be
able to keep that up all the time given that Surfing almost
puts many people into a trancelike state?


[I hear Perry in the background groaning and muttering "I told you so"]
These buffer overflow bugs should be taught in every programming
101 course along with fencepost errors.

I'm not even sure if I want to write the obligatory program to exploit
the hack given that some malicious jerk would probably use it
on his home page to attack people.
