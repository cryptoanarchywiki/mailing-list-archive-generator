Before you do it, make sure your ISP doesn't mind you telneting to port 25.
VCU's computer dept. doesn't take to kindly to it.  They're worried about 
people sending forged e-mail.  (I was tempted to tell the guy when I got 
caught doing it that they should put a copy of PGP online for folks to use.
But I just wanted my account re-instated.)
