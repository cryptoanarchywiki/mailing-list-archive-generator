I agree with what I think your sentiment is, but bear in mind that "cash
transactions" are in fact limited by various laws and regulations about
reporting cash payments.

Try buying a car with cash, especially a car costing over $10,000.

Black Unicorn posted an account a while back (sometime last year) of his
efforts to pay cash for a new car.

The restrictions on cash are mostly oriented toward ostensibly stopping
"drug profits" from being used to buy expensive items. The usual cash
figure that invokes special laws is $10,000, with "structuring" of sub-$10K
cash transfers an additional issue.

I foresee more restrictions coming, not fewer.

Several of us have written extensively on this subject.
