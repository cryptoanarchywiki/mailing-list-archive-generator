I agree with Peter's point... some of the core cypherpunks (I'll not
mention names) can be somewhat elitist, whether they mean to or not.  Not
that they don't have some reason to be...as Pat Farrell once told me the
cypherpunks mailing list is, to some degree, an IQ filter.  Many
cypherpunks have a firm reason for some self-indulgent pride.  However,
our goal (or, at any rate, _a_ goal) is to make crypto use ubiquitous,
and for this we must deal with the public at large in a, perhaps, more
diplomatic and user-friendly manner.

True, but if the majority of active participants see an alternative
agreeable to them, they may just switch and start calling themselves
something else.  If the list owner likes it and changes the name of the 
list, then what of the cypherpunks unwilling to change?  It would appear, 
then, that they would be the ones who would have to find somewhere else 
to go.

Anybody who reads the mailing list or the cyphernomicon knows this, but 
anyone hearing the name for the first time does not get this impression.

Better than a vote (and more effective in western culture, where only 39% 
of the population votes anyway but just tends to go with the flow) is to 
propose an alternative, flat out, adopt it for yourself, and whoever 
prefers it will follow your lead.  If nobody likes it, then the 
cypherpunks are simply here to stay.

My point is that you may not have to do all this.  This is a recurring 
thread on the list. . . if enough people feel the same way you do you 
could have the human resources effective for a cypherpunks "take-over".

As for myself, I don't think I would change. . . I actually _am_ a 
"long-haired wierdo".  I think a slightly more conservatively named 
organization similar to the cypherpunks would be a good thing, however, 
simply because I like the idea of having something more low-key to compare 
c-punks with, sort of like the IRA to Sinn Fein.  I'm just offering some 
humble advice, knowing full well that I am for the most part an unknown 
lurker without much reputational weight to throw around.  It's also part 
of a leadership dynamic that is, I feel, underused.  (Furthermore, if it 
works, I could use it as a paper topic for my social psychology class ;). )

Sincerely,
