archives:

Of course, the above is complete and utter crap (as Simon Spero pointed out
to me in much, much more polite terms 8-).  Let me take a stab at v2.0:

I've read through the SSL spec, and it provides authentication for both the
server and the client, though these features are rarely used, probably
because they are somewhat inconvenient for the user.  A good practice would
be to always code your SSL app to check that the CN (Common Name) field of
the certificate is the same as the hostname listed in the URL (CN always
appears to be an IP address, at least for Netscape server certificates).


Still, even with the bogus last paragraph, I stand by the rest of my post.
 I obviously haven't seen Netscape source, so I don't really know what
checks it might have, but none of the other SSL apps I've seen have an
auto-check feature, though it doesn't seem to be much more trouble at all.
