So, Dave and I got free munitions shirts (they're different, though;
the font is smaller and they have a bunch of X'd out Constitutional
Amendments on the back; I think they ere designed by Joel Furr) for
our bug find.

So I'm wearing it today.  The thing is, I live in International House,
a residence that has 50% non-Americans.

So, any consensus as to whether it's actually illegal to do so?  I
remember some disagreement a few weeks ago that AFAIK wasn't resolved.

As far as I can tell, it's _technically_ illegal, but any LEO would be
out of his mind to try to enforce it (it would have to be a Fed, too,
wouldn't it?  Or can regular city cops get you for violating export
restrictions?).

   - Ian
