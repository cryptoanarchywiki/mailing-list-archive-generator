The Navigator doesn't make any special connections nor perform any data collection
on the client-side.  In fact, most of the engineers here would quit long before
we would provide information without consent.  That was the reason for removing
the mail address from the HTTP header years ago...it is very easy to track what
the Navigator sends out by simply setting up a proxy/firewall...

Netscape (the company) does attempt to track users through their contacts with
our homepage...Needless to say, this is a common practice.  We track hits, IP
addresses, and attempt to use cookies to determine unique users...We sell advertising
based on estimates of hits/etc...if you never hit our site, you are never counted...
even if you do hit our site, no information (other than IP address) is ever known...
