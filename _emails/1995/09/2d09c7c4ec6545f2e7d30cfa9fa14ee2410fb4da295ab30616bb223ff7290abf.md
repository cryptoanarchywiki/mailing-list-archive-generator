This is from the Sept 11, 1995 Inter@ctive Week:

Netscape Communications Corp.'s freely distributed browser is getting 
commercial-grade encryption, making it safe to use in the U.S.  The 
change comes two weeks after Inter@ctive Week disclosed that the free 
version contained reletively weak encryption that had been cracked by a 
European user.

[...]

Meanwhile, in an as yet unannouced move, the company said it would place 
its commercial browser online for free downloading.  THat move apparently 
comes in direct response to an Inter@ctive Week article that highlighted 
the fact that all shareware versions of the browser contain the so-called 
40-bit key encryption software which was recently proven insecure.  THe 
commercial version, sold only in the U.S. contains an unbreakable 128-bit 
encryption scheme.

Netscape said it received word last week that the State Department had 
cleared that version for release on the Net, but only within the U.S., 
owing to current export laws banning the export of encryption schemes 
stronger than 40 bits.  THe company could provide no details by press 
time on how it would ensure that the 128-bit version wouldn't leak beyond 
U.S. borders.

[end excerpts]

I love how Inter@ctive Week pats themselves on the back for making people 
aware of the problem. I guess the cypherpunk media hacking is working.  
Doing things behind the scenes and making the press think they are the 
internet users salvation looks like a good tactic.

The cypherpunks forced a situation where Net users now have better 
encryption available to them.  I'd say this is a big win.
