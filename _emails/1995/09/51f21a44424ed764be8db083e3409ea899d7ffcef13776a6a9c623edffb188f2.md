Also front page, above the fold, for the "San Jose Mercury News," the
newspaper of record of the Silicon Valley.

And CNBC is reporting the story on its hourly updates of the news.

(These computer lists are really great for investors! I heard about the
Apple problems a few days before they hit the street, and was able to
unload a bunch of shares at $45, a day before it dropped, now down to
around $36. "He who hesitates to act on inside information is lost.")

P.S. On Netscape, I've finally decided to do some buying. Sure, this latest
flaw is another embarrassment. But more deals and link-ups than ever are
being inked, and they've got the resources to really spruce up Navigator
and related products. I just don't see too many competitors on the horizon.

Actually, I was planning to buy some Netscape stock, now that the IPO froth
has settled. And since I have this info on the flaw, I _have_ to buy it,
else be guilty of "insider non-trading." As Stew Brownstein, a friend of
mine, has noted, if insider trading rules are interpreted logically, then
_failure_ to make a planned trade on the basis of insider information is
just as illegal as deciding to make some trade on the basis of insider
information. The SEC should require all insiders to file a daily report,
preferably before the market opens in NY, listing all of their planned
transactions for that day, so that violations of the "insider non-trading"
laws can be detected and prosecuted.

(Yes, I know that I am not an "insider" by SEC definitions. Poetic license.)
