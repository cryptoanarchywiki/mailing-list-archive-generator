And if problems like this don't get solved, how do you expect digital
online banking to be done? Psychic quantum transfers between the
machines? What do you think a bank in the future is, if not a server
that has to do lots and lots of RSA or D-H or what have you?

Sorry for being nasty, Tim. Its just that some of us live in the real
world, have real clients, and actually worry about this as a
problem. This *is* a legitimate problem. Consider what the load on a
web site using D-H key exchange for every connection gets like when
you have millions of people hitting it every day.

You obviously haven't heard of Fortezza cards. Yup, they are key
escrowed -- but they do in fact do public key operations on
board. There are a lot of them floating around.

The reason the market for this is weird is the same reason Sun took
the DES chips off its motherboards years ago -- you can't conduct
modern business with the fucked up export regime we are dealing with.
