As if they couldn't figure it out anyway. It isn't an "RSA signature"
by the way. Read format.doc sometime.

Never, I hope. It would dramatically lower the utility of the
system. Can you imagine how disgusting it would be to try decrypting
something if you have a dozen keys outstanding? Not to mention how
hard it would be to deal with figuring out that you should even try to
decrypt things in the first place.

It isn't an RSA signature. Its a bunch of magic numbers.

Look, get real already. If someone sees a bunch of random numbers in
mail sent by me, its going to be pretty obvious what the hell is
inside anyway.

I very much see this whole thing as a non-issue.
