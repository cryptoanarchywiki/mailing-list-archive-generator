If anybody has worked on or is interested in working on creating an 
anonymous CU-SeeMe reflector, please contact me (where anonymous in this 
case means that CU-SeeMe clients do not report the proper IP numbers of 
other clients).  I've done a bit of work on it but can't quite get 
"normal" reflector behaviour.
