I posted this to the Cyberia mailing list, but think it has some
implications for Cypherpunks as well. And, I'm responding to Duncan
Frissell, one of our own.

(I don't advise subscribing to Cyberia unless legal issues interest you and
you have the time for another high-volume mailing list. Still, some bright
folks there--as well as some dullards. David Friedman just joined the list.
To subscribe, send a message to listserv@listserv.cc.wm.edu with the
