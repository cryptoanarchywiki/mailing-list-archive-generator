YES!  Safe exec!  Use software protection;)  (Can you tell that when I read
this I was LOL!?)

Well...you can tell by looking, certainly that's not true when you need
a condem;)

That's true, I have to admit that I usually don't use them either.  Once
you know how they're coded up, and how little code is actually used, it
seems silly anyway to call a popen or system and suffer the overhead of
the function calls and the loss of control.

You're singing to the choir.  Sigh, Eric Allman's been several times
surprised about what turned out to be outside data.
