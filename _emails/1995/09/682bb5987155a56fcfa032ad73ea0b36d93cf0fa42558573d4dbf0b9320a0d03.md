Actually it was aimed at the rumors that Iran had been printing U.S. 
currency on a large scale and using it abroad.  When I say Iran, I mean 
a government backed program.  New York Times had an article on the matter 
last year.  With enough interest I will try to Lexis/Nexus it.

While there was some evidence that Iran had indeed been forging notes, 
the extent was unclear/minimal.  Of course, with this kind of rumor there 
is the issue of confidence in the currency as well as actual threat.

The first response was the inset of the polyester and foil thread in the 
bills (and NO they can't detect quantity as you go through airport 
sensors, and don't ask me again).  The foreign traveller will notice the 
serious scrutiny all U.S. bills abroad will receive, particular attention 
paid to the presence of the strip.  Many foreign shops will not take U.S. 
bills which are older and have no strip as a result.

This new plan, which is total lunacy of course, and which I expect to fail, 
but the real zap is on anyone with a spare million in counterfeit or undeclared 
currency.

I might add, try being a tourist in Estonia and presenting U.S. bills that 
are no good in the U.S.  You'll be about as popular as someone in the 
Midwest with Canadian bills.
