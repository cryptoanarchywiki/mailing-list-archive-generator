forgive me for the advertisement, but I *am* a lawyer, and I think this 
well-intentioned rant gets some stuff wrong.  If you want to know why I 
think this, visit my homepage and follow the link to my Clipper paper.
Please note the homepage is a bit mobile right now; this address is 
temporary, but the next one should be stable.
