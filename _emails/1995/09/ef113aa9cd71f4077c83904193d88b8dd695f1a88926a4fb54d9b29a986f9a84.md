Not the least of which is that money launderers can use "AI Software" to
generate a stream of real and dummy money transfers that emulates "normal"
money transfers.  Not to mention the fact that monopoly money transfer
networks that can be surveilled by the Feds (FEDWIRE and SWIFT) are not long
for this world.  They will be replaced by encrypted, open, net-based systems.

"Yes Virginia, one *can* have an encrypted, open system.  In fact, that's
the best way to have an open system."
