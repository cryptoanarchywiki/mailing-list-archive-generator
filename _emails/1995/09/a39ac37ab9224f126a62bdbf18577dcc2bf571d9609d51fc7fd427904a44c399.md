Does anybody wish to express any comments regarding MIME security.  I
have read the RFC's and any/all doc's I could find on this issue.  I
understand what the security risks are, but I have been unsuccessful in
my attempts to find info regarding what is being done, or has been done
to correct this.  If I remember correctly, I think I once saw a brief
mention of filters or something.

I am new to this stuff, so any assistance would greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Rick
