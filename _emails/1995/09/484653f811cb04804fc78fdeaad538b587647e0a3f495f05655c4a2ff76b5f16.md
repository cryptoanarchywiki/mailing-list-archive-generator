  Is there a proof of correctness available for this algorithm? It
looks almost like a Radix-B peasant division algorithm with some
modifications. Is there an algorithmic analysis available? I also
I think there is a bug in your description. Let k+1 = n+1
(e.g. the dividend is 1 more "block" than the modulus). Then
i=n starting out, and we have

3. Y=Y - Y[n] * B^n + Y[n] * U * B^(n-n-1)  [we have B^-1] I'm assuming
this was unintended.


How does this algorithm compare to computing the reciprocal
via Newton's Formula, and then multiplying by the reciprocal
using Karatsuba multiplication? While I was at IBM Watson I invented
a modular reduction algorithm that saves 1/4 the number of 
multiplications required on average once you have the reciprocal 
computed.
