Citation please.  Killing is usually a state matter.  I doubt
there was any such federal ruling.

In California, there is a legal presumption that anyone who
illegally enters an occupied dwelling, at night, is a threat
to life or great bodily harm.  You may, therefore, use deadly
force without further evidence.  (This means you can shoot 'em
in the back if you want.)

Now back to the booby-trapped computer thread:

I think it would be better to have your booby-trap kill your 
data, not the nice men in the nomex ski masks.  While those folks
might take a dim view of the former, they would most certainly
would take extreme umbridge at the latter.
