It makes a little bit of sense - I'm not aware of any software,
other than PGP and now Netscape, that _explicitly_ goes after randseed.bin,
though of course just about anything can try.  

Assuming the code is inspectable (which it currently is), if I can
see that all it's going to do with the file is crunch it into MD5
along with a bunch of other stuff, I'm not too worried, even though
it is stealing slack(entropy) from PGP.
