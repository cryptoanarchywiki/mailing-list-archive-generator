-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I'm pleased to announce the release of "Bryce's Auto-PGP" version 1.0.


Bryce's Auto-PGP, a.k.a. "BAP", is a Unix script which makes it 
simple and convenient to use PGP with almost any Unix message-
handling application.  As far as I know there is no Unix
mssage-handling application that cannot be integrated with BAP.  BAP 
has been test by me personally with Elm, Pine, mh and trn, and it 
has also turned out to be useful with such Unix utilities as finger
and vi.


I'm distributing BAP from my World Wide Web site:

http://www-ugrad.cs.colorado.edu/~wilcoxb/BAP.html


As an experiment in cyberspace economics, I am asking for 10
cyberbucks, the currency for the Internet created by DigiCash 
company in return for BAP.  To sign up for the cyberbuck trial 
and get your free cyberbucks visit:

http://www.digicash.com/ecash/ecash-home.html


If you have any problems acquiring or using BAP, please e-mail me.


Bryce
