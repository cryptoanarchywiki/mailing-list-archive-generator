Netnews was the old "msgs" program on serious steroids - the thing everyone
was supposed to run in their .login (or .profile) scripts to get
system-wide announcements. My bet is that msgs was inspired by the
TOPS-20/ITS equivalents at MIT. Netnews subsequently underwent relatively
rapid forced evolution in its early days to meet the scaling demands of the
UUCP network, and the Internet of that time (~1983).

The "notesfiles" system from UIUC that Rob Kolstad and Ray Essick wrote was
not so much a distant cousin of NetNews as it was a similar system designed
to solve the same problem (distributed message-based computer
conferencing); I would argue that NetNews had the better transports and
backends, but notesfiles was one or two up on NetNews in UI features
(message threads, etc). The two were sufficiently close that (bad) gateways
were written to move messages from one system to the other.

With any luck, the next round of NetNews user interfaces will remove all of
the UI advantages of notesfiles - the hooks have always been there, but
writing good UI's hard work, and most NetNews hackers (me included) have
had more fun/luck/interest in hacking the transport level to be ever more
slightly efficient.

I had the impression from what I read that this was going to be an IPX WAN,
and that after announcing this Brave New Service, the partners discovered
just how poorly IPX behaves on a WAN, and so have backed out to Notes on IP
for this thing. I haven't heard much about it since, but I'd be surprised
to find AT&T being foolish enough to try and operate an IPX WAN.

Lotus is indeed one of RSA's licensees; I remember reading that in the WSJ
at about the same time that Apple became one.

I still place my message-based distributed collaboration bets on NetNews
technology, or some obvious derivative of it.
