Right - this was an abduction case in Florida, if memory serves.

I don't see that as a problem.  I'm about to set up at least one of these
myself, and I believe that there are others around - please correct me
if I'm wrong.

In any case, there needn't be a web page to do the actual reporting.
There can be web pages to advertise, and then a simple maildrop for
the tips.  You could even arrange that the maildrop send everything
to a remailer for delivery to a non-advertised address for an extra
layer of protection (in case someone forgot to use a remailer to send
the tip in the first place, or they screwed up in a way that revealed
their identity).
