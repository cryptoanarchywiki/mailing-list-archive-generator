It does reduce the ability of geographical organizations
to restrict who does business there, so markets will probably
force some shakeups in jurisdictions.  But lawyer work seems
to mostly involve either contracts or courts - as long as 
courts are still run by governments, they can restrict who
gets to practice in them, and who's allowed to write paper that
they'll judge disputes about.  Crypto _could_ be used for
a modern version of the Stamp Tax - documents might need to 
be digitally signed by Certified Lawyers (though of course
that may be lawyers putting their stamps on work mostly done
by clerks.)  

Crypto may make it easier to resolve some kinds of disputes,
by identifying who did what when, but the net isn't going to
make the number of disputes decrease....
