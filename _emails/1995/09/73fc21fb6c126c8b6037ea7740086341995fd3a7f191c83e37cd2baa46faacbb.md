Umm. The spec says that there is a maximum cookie size and a maximum
number of cookies that should be sent. I'll be the last to claim
that Netscape created a 'standards-compliant' product, but they
have at least recognized that these things aren't supposed to be
infinitely large.

The server can't write anything. Cookies are returned as HTTP 
response headers, which will either be:
	A) Ignored by a cookie-ignorant browser, or, 
	B) Processed by a cookie-aware browser.

In either case, the cookie cache reading/writing is done by the
browser. If the browser is running as 'you' then it can access
files that 'you' own. If you write protect it against yourself, then
its likely that your user-agent (Netscape) running as 'you' can't
write to that file.

Cheers!
