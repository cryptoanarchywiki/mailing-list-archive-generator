Pardon my obvious question, but if there's some sort of GAK/LEAF, then
why limit it to 64-bit? It seems possible that the assumption is 'just
in case the GAK is tampered with' there's still a chance of cracking it,
should the need arise.

[..]

I'm wondering just how securely a hack-proof escrow system can be written.
It seems that someone can always go in with a sophisticated debugger and
do some tampering of the software.

And one need not mention the what-if-foreign-competitors-do-not-implement-
this-scheme? question...
