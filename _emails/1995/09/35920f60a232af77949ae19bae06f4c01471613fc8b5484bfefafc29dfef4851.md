One solution to this problem would be to modify PGP so that the session key for 
the document was released rather than the passphrase for the public key. The 
former would provide only read access, the latter would allow th scientologists 
to forge Wollerstein's signature on other material. In addition many of the 
documents may be subject to privillege.


I would have thought that there would be grounds to oppose the court action in 
any case on various grounds, not least the previous judgement which the 
Scientologists lost and have failed to pay the damages awarded. There might also 
be grounds to oppose disclosure if the case was brought in order to obtain 
secret material rather than for legitimate purposes.

In the UK the judge can be asked to review documents and decide whether they 
should be made avaliable.

Surely the disclosure laws would work in wollerstein's favour in any case. He 
can request disclosure of internal Scientology material.
