However:

a) You can't read it through a remailer (yet).

b) Anyone watching the site can tell which threads you're interested in, 
and thereby determine what your real interests in this group are.

c) It cuts off anyone who doesn't have direct net access, or can't afford 
long telephone calls. It's a lot cheaper to download a day's mail in one 
go than to spend three hours browsing a WWW site.
