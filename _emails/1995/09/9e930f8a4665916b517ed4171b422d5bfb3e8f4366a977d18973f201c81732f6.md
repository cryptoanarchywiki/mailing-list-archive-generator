 Maybe I'm missing the larger point, but isn't it accurate that in the 
digital world, one protocol or procedure may take the place of perhaps 
several of the 'real-world' procedures or protocols?  An effective 
mechanism of signing with non-repudiation that was recognized as binding 
on the signer would permit 'checks', 'promissory notes', 'IOUs', and 
'warrants'.  Some of the other species listed in your post aren't really 
money, anyway.  They are things you can buy with money, like stock 
certificates or Maseratis.  One could conceivably buy convertible 
debentures with e-cash, the same as one could buy them with 'real money', 
but it doesn't follow that there should be some one-to-one mapping of real 
money objects and classes onto electronic analogues.  Once again, i've 
probably missed the forest, but a couple of the trees distracted me.
