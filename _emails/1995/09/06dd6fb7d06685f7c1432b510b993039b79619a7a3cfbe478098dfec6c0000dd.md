I seem to remember a software piracy case from a number of years back.  The
case was settled by Apple showing that their code had been copied by the
copyright "easteregg" hidden in the roms.  Made for a quick and effective
demonstration in court.  (The story may be apocryphal, but it makes for an
example as to how such things do have a (supposed) valid use in protecting
code from being snagged by  other companies.)
