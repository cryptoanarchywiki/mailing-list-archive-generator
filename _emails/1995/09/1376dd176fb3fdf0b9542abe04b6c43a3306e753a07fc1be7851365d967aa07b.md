I took a look at the FACTNet web page.  There is a file encrypted with
PGP using the "-c" option.  They are asking for people to help guess
the Pass Phrase.  Why would anyone bother if they had no clue that the
file contained anything 'interesting'.

If this is the file that the Co$ is trying to crack, then what the
is being asked for is a pass phrase that can be handed to the Co$ that
will pass the PGP valid key check and still not decrypt the data to
anything usefull.

If Larry Wollersheim does have the valid key.  It would be a simpler
process to know what fake key to use and work it backwards through
the MD5 to arrive at an ascii string to produce the fake key.

Too bad this wouldn't be plausable for the secret ring.  Perhaps PGP
needs an option to specify the key in Hex and make the process easy.
