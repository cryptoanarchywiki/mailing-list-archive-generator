But this wouldn't have solved Netscape's problem.  Netscape was using a  
pretty good PRNG (the one in RSAREF).  The problem was they were/are using a  
naive method of seeding it.  The output of the PRNG would have been  
statistically random, but since the seed had ridiculously little entropy it  
was easy to guess.
