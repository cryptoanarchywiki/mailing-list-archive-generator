Grumpiness warning: I have held my tongue the past few months as all of
these "this t-shirt has been declared a munition!!!" messages went out, but
I can hold my tongue no longer.

Nope, no more so than letting a foreign national read Schneier's book is a
violation of the ITAR. If you dispute this, ask whether Schneier's book is
banned from export (the book, not the optional diskette). It isn't. Nor are
other cryptography _books_ banned from export.

I'm not minimizing the issue of export of machine-readable code, as in
diskettes. But to claim that a blurry, printed on cotton "barcode" is even
remotely in the same class as exporting a workable set of cryptographic
system routines, or that letting a furriner merely "gaze upon" this blurry
barcode, is a violation of the ITARs is laughable.

No. No more so than "flashing" a copy of a crypto book would constitute a
violation.

It was this series of posts about whether wearing the "munitions t-shirt"
near schools was a crime or not that made me think the silly season had
arrived. If the t-shirt is a munition, and books are munitions, then
libraries must be real "ammunition dumps," ready to explode at any minute.
News at 11.

Let's get real.
