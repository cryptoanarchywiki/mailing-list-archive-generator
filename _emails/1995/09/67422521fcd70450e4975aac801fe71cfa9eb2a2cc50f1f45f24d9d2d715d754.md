I think I can be foregiven for sharing a little private mail interchange I
just had with Vince Cate, the Anguillan ex-cypherpunk/technomad, who's
digging out from under Hurricane Luis...

Cheers,
Bob Hettinga

I am not sure if my other mail made it.

Ya, the roof blew off of the phone company and also the electric company.
All the phone company could do was set up an inmarsat phone line and
charge $60/min to make calls.

Thanks.  I can't think of anything I need.  Unless you know who sells
directional cell phone antennas.

Thanks!
