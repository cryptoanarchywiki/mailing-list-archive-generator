One of the points that I'm exploring is "what kind of transformation
makes for an un-fuzzable fingerprint bit." This example seems to fall
into the same bin as the "two cameras" approach; the two sentences come
out of the author's head in the same way that the two cameras are pointed
at the same piece of reality.

Right. All of these approaches, however, assume unforgeable bits, either
by obscurity of insertion, or by means that are analagous to the "two
cameras" approach. I'm trying to come up with a robust definition of
"two cameras-ness", any suggestions appreciated.

The problem with changes like this is that if they're trivial enough
not to require retesting, etc., then once hackers know the accepted
range of modification, they can completely fuzz them up. Various
other schemes such as reordering object modules fall into this as
well. The problem with software is that it can be reverse-compiled,
then compiled again. Unless you're willing to define a series of branches
that really do different things (and are not so trivial to be
expressed as algorithmic variants), then bits can be fuzzed. If you
_do_ write these branches, you are in for a rough time when it comes
time to do quality assurance on your software.
