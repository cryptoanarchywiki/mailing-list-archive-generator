A brief note, though the hardship to the Caribbean islands will not be brief.

St. Thomas, St. Croix, and other islands were hit extremely hard by
hurricane Marilyn. Previous hurricanes, including Luis, also hit some of
the islands.

Power in St. Thomas may not be back for a year in some parts. The roads,
sewers, power lines, phone system, etc. will likely have to be completely
rebuilt.

(Yes, there have been more hurricanes this year than in most years...not
clear if it's just a Poisson fluctuation, or symptomatic of deeper weather
pattern changes.)

ObCypherpunks Relevance: A couple of past or current list members have
nascent Internet plans in some of these islands. (I think one of them is
way south, just off Venezuela.)

I suspect "Caribbean Data Havens" and "Internet Sites" are further off than
they were a few months ago.
