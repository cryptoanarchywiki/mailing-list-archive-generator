That is ok! I just called there "Sales" dept. and asked for some info.
to be sent to me on there serevers.  I got 5 copies of what is on the
WEB page. I could have done that.  I asked him for prices and told him
this was to present to a group of Marketing and Buss. type for a
community system to bring Internet access to a whole county that does
not have it now..

BTW, the system will be running on Suns and SGI's.....

Oh well..

I thought they would do better than this. So far, there no better then
sun at customer service...
