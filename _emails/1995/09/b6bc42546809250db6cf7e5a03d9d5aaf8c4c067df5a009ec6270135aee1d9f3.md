  Here is a simple way to handle the problem, using our old discredited
friend, XOR. Set up your software to periodically XOR the key with FFFF.
This way, each bit will be a 0 half the time, and a 1 the other half.
You have a flag that tells whether the key is in normal or inverted
form, so that you can quickly perform any necessary computations on it,
but there should not be any long-term memory effect.
