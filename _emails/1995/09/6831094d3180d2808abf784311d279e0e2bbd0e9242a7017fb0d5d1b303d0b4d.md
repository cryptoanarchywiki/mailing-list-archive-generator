Your randomness will depend on the prior randomness of your original
input... and if you already have that, the TM won't give you any additional
randomness (rather, this approach will just take all the randomness you give
it and reduce it to 1 bit of randomness, losing all the rest).

On the other hand, if the 'random' program is not already truly random, then
you may well have patterns in the bits generated by the halting observation.
For instance, if you use a known PRNG to get your "random" programs, then
given the same seed you will end up with the same programs (and therefore
the same resulting 'random' bits from the TM halting output)... which, in
other words, gains you nothing AFAICS over simply using the PRNG's output
directly, except of course that it exercises your CPU. :-)  The attacker
still only needs to figure out the seed.

Not on my machine (or most others, I'd wager)!  I thought about this, and
whenever I'm running Netscape (for instance) my screen is probably identical
over 50% of the time because I tend to have the same things open when I run
a given program.

Even in the general case, consider that most people have a preferred desktop
layout (in Windows, they have ProgMan sitting in one place on the screen
with usually the same groups visible/open)... not only will that piece of
the screen bitmap not give you any randomness from one run to the next, but
unless you go looking for "things that haven't changed since last time" your
program won't even know what's reducing your randomness.

Better, but be careful how you use it; that's what Netscape thought too. :-)

This sounds a bit better... except, of course, that when you initiate a
secure session in Netscape with a specific party/server, your screen has a
very good chance of looking the same each time you connect with that entity
because it is the same URL. :-)

Would someone who's more informed please correct my analysis?  Thanks in
advance,
