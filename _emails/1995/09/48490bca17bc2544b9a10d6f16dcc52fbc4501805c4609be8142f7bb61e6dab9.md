I got a letter in the mail today from Plenum Publishing Corp in NY,
advertising a book called _Mind Your Own Business: The Battle for
Personal Privacy_ by Gini Graham Scott.  It seems I am on a
mailing list for privacy freaks.  Oh the irony!

They must have gotten my name from somewhere.  The only two sources that
I can think of are the lists for CFP '94 and '95, and a
revolver club that I used to be a member of.  Has anyone else on the 
list gotten this ad?
