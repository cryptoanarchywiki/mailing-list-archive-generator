PGP is probably too unweildy for the non-hobbyist to comfortably use. I don't know if anyone else has suggested it but I'd strongly encourage Intuit to make CryptDisk for the Mac easily available. I use it to maintain an encrypted partition for my financial data and the user interface is quite simple. I believe the DOS equivalent is SecureDisk.
