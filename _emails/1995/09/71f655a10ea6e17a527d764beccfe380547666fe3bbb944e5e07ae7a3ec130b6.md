Vince Foster was technical advisor to "The X-Files." The NSA had him killed
at Fort Darcy because he was getting too close to the Bilderbergers and
their control of the secret UFO technology first given to the Nazis and
then transferred to Winnemucca, Nevada as part of Operation Paperclip.

The pilot who flew Bush in an SR-71 to negotiate with the Iranians to delay
the release of the hostages and so defeat Carter in 1980 is also the author
of "Nomenclature of a Conspiracy Cabal," one of the books shown in that
episode.

President Clinton, at the Underground White House near Edwards Air Force
Base, OKed the hit on Foster, even though "The X-Files" was one of his
favorite shows. The Greys must be appeased.

--Klaus! von Future Prime, who actually has several dozen books on these
and similar subjects
