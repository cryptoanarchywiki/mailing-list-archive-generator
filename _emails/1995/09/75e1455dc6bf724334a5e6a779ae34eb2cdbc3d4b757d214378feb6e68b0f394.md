There has been much handwringing today over some poor guys out west
who have been  holding their own "common law courts,"  along with 
wonderment that they lack faith in the American justice system.

In the last year we've seen in the national news:

* FBI and BATF murdering, lying, & tampering with evidence. (Waco/ Ruby 
  Ridge hearings / WTC bombing trial /etc.)

* Cops confiscating cash from citizens in Atlanta, and pocketing it.

* Cops fabricating evidence wholesale in Philadelphia.

* Cops admitting to beating people in LA.

* Cops from NYC having drunken riots in D.C.

* Cops from around D.C. beating a suspect - later found to be 
  innocent - until he was comatose.

* Cops having a shootout - among themselves - in AZ.

* Cops raping and murdering in New Orleans.

In several of these cases, little or no punishment resulted.


A couple of local incidents, in Knoxville, TN:

* Several months ago, the local paper (Knoxville News-Sentinel) revealed 
that jailers at the city/county jail are in the habit of  hanging 
prisoners by their wrists until their hands turn black.  Those that are 
really disfavored are also forced to wear a vomit-filled hood.  To my 
knowledge, no one has yet been has been taken to task for this.

* Knox medical examiner Randall Pedigo was found to be drugging and
raping young boys.  He pulled a gun on the cops and was shot.  After 
recovering, he was allowed to plead guilty in return for a 1-year sentence
at the penal farm.


The mayor of Knoxville, Victor Ashe, is active in the U.S. Conference 
of Mayors and has served as a spokesman for the organization.  Presumably,
he and they are untroubled by events like the above.  I can't recall him -
or them - so much as expressing concern.



The "angry white men" have just figured out what the angry black men 
have known for a long time:  that the "justice system" in the US is a tool
used by some to impose their will on others.  It has little if 
anything to do with justice.

Is this radical right-wing rhetoric or is it Marxist?  Or is it just a 
statement of fact?

What percentage of the population can think this way without the jury 
system failing?  What percentage does think this way?  Is that why we're 
hearing calls for the abolition of the jury system?


Tenuous crypto tie:  

Why would anyone trust these guys to hold our escrowed keys?
