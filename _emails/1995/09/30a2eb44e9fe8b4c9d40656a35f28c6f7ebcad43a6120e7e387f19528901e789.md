In an interview today in a Stockholm paper with a technical spokes-
person for Hewlett-Packard (about the HP internal net with 19
worldwide connections to the Internet - by the way, allegedly
no one has ever succeeded in breaking their firewalls) it was
stated that Netscape was heavily used for HP internal business.
Apparantly there was a choice between Notes and the internal
Web, the Web being favoured 470:1.
