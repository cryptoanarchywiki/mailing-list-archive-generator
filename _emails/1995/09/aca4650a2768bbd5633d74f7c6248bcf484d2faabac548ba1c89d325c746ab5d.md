I was of course being facetious about the putative "Cypherpunks logo."
Sorry I did not insert smileys.

The problem with the "Cypherpunks press release" notion is this:

-- we are an effective anarchy.

-- there is no "spokespunk" and no foreseeable way of choosing one.

Some people seem to _want_ some kind of central contact organization or
point, some place to lobby, buy advertising, send faxes, give press
conferences, etc.

But I don't see it happening.

Individuals and their organizations are free of course to do as they wish,
but if they claim to speak for "the Cypherpunks," they'll be out of line.

We are not a direct democracy, nor even are we a representative democracy.
No board of directors, etc.

While this undeniably affects how "messages" get out, that's life. There
are plenty of organizations with Washington offices, and with spokesmen
available for comment. But they don't have what we have.
