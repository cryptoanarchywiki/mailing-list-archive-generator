On the contrary, the Libertarian Party has come out strongly in favor of
cryptography and privacy, and they are consistently either #3 or #4 in
popularity. (I believe Peace and Freedom is usually #4 and LP is usually
#3.)

Their home page (http://www.access.digex.net/~lphq/lphq.html) says: "The
LPHQ is the center of activities of the Libertarian Party, the third
largest political party in the U.S. We stand for individual liberty, both
in terms of personal and financial freedom."

It is impossible to argue that the Libertarian Party is opposed in any way
to the right to encrypt, and their 1994 platform makes this clear:

"We oppose all  proposed regulations of civilian research on encryption
methods. We also  oppose government classification of such research or
requirements that deciphering methods be disclosed to the government."

I point this out not to argue in favor of the LP here, but to correct a
seriously incorrect statement.
