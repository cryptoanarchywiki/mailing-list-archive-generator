Normally when there can be confusion between a movie title and an existent
book title (in that the movie could be a dramatization of the book based on
general subject matter), the movie gets title clearance, pays a token
release fee to the book's author, and puts up a title clearance credit in
the movie credits. For an example of this, check out Bladerunner (based on
"Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep?" not "Bladerunner" [which was by a
different author]) credits where the prior uses of the title were
mentioned.
