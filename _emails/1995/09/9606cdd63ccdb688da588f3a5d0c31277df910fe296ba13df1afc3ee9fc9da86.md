The guy who takes in money and vanishes, or skips to Rio, out of the reach
of extradition treaties, is not all that different from the posited
situation of a nym dematerializing.

The "law" can't really touch either situation, efficiently, and so other
mechanisms are generally used (or recommended, though many con victims have
fail to do so).

I've not claimed the scenarios are identical, only that the issue of agents
taking in money or promising services and then vanishing is as old as
history. That such things will happen with digital pseudonyms is assured.
Fortunately, countermeasures appear practical.

If the "market" (actually, some players in the market) chose to dispense
with bonding and then got burned, so be it. Later iterations of the market,
and the players, will thus likely _not_ dispense with bonding and other
such measures.

Think of it as evolution in action.
