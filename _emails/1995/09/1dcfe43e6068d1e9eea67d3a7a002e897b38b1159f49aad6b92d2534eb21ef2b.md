I of course agree strongly with Duncan.

We don't often talk about this aspect, as it was all hashed-over a couple
of years ago, and most newcomers to the list do not seem as interested as
we were. (And, it has little to do with coding in C  :-})

Those interested might want to look at the very long chapter on "Crypto
Anarchy" in my Cyphernomicon, or my paper, "Crypto Anarchy and Virtual
Communities."

Or read "True Names" and "Snow Crash" and think about what happens when the
stuff we talk about is added. (Hint: Hiro Protagonist would not be "vastly
wealthy" in the Metaverse but poor in the Real World (tm).)
