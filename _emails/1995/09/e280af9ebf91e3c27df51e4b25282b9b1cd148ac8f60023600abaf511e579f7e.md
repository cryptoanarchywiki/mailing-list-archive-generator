The distinction, I think, is that for the past 40, 50, 60 ??? years, 
wiretapping has been available, recently only through court order 
(lawfully).  Encryption changes the status quo.

Change brings those who want to hasten it and those who want to stop it.  
The problem here, at least for me, is what *should* the policy be.  You 
(with one or two exceptions) have provided me with a lot of grist for the 
mill.  My thought process has changed dramatically on the issue, but is 
still fluid.
