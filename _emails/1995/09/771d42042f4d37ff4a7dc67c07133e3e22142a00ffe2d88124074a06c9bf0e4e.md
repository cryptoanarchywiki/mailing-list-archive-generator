         Phil Zimmermann/Amnesty International?

   I was wondering if the Zimmermann case would be a proper concern of
Amnesty International. Phil is obviously a political dissident. His
persecution is obviously political. If Phil got support from Amnesty
Int'l, then his persecution could be a big embarrassment to the Federal
gov't. He has a lot of supporters and taking up his cause could be a
big promotional for Amnesty International. The Feds might feel forced
to drop the matter early. Any ideas?
