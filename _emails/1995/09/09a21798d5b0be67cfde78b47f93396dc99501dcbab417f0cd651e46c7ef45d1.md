This works.  IBM used to have publish a monthly journal (I forget the
name, it came out of one of their Yorktown labs) that did exactly this
kind of thing for exactly this kind of reason.  ACtually, they wrote
about stuff that they thought was 5-10 years away.

Mr/Ms. Anonymous is lying.  His/her name appears nowhere in the credits,
and his/her code appears nowhere in any PGP release.  Don't waste any
neurons on it.
