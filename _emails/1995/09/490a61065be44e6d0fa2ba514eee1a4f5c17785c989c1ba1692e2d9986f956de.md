It's my impression that the play was staged a few years after my book 
came out in 1984 (though I chose the title in 1982). I remember reading 
the reviews then, and they didn't 
seem to mention that it was a revivial of a years-old play whose name I had 
unintentially used for my own book. (Unlike the case for the current 
movie, whose screenwriter seemed to know of my own book.)  If 
you have evidence that the play was indeed produced before 1984, please 
let me know.  Otherwise, I'd be happy to accept your apology, Peter.
