On my secure systems, when a machine running X has to be on an
insecure network, I compile the X server so that it physically lacks
the ability to speak to the network -- it does all its IPC via unix
domain sockets. However, you are correct that most people don't take
precautions like I do.

Xauth isn't secure, as folks have shown.

Agreed.
