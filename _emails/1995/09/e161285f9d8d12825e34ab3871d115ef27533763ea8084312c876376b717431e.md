<g> I think not.. Kind of like the coincidence that just before any gun 
law votes, some maniac goes on a shooting spree.. ;)

I would be interested to hear what Reno has to say.. if someone is in a

appreciate it.

'Course, I would rather have pedophiles using computers than stalking parks..


Thanks-
