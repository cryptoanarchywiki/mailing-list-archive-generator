I do not think that PGP 2.x can easily (ie: Automatically) use one key for
Signing and another for Encrypting a Message (it does both at the same time
if you ask). If I "Clear Sign" a message and then Encrypt it, then I get
the result but I'm not sure if doing the decrypt on such a message will
automatically spot the signature and verify it (as would occur with a E+S
pass).

PGP3 is supposed to have the ability to have keysets that contain two keys
for this purpose (ie: When you generate a key set you can ask it to
generate separate Sign and Encrypt keys so that separate keys get used for
each function).
