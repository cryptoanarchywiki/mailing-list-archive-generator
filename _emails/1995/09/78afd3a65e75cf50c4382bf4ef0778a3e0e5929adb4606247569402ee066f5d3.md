This sounds like a very good idea to me, since I find the flood of
e-mail from CP, much of it non-crypto-related, to be annoying. If
this traffic were in a newsgroup, it would travel compressed over
my phone line, and I might use a killfile on sstuff like the CO$ thread.

Anything posted to the main cypherpunks mailing list and the spun-off mailing
lists (steganogrpahy, remailers, nym servers, etc) could be posted to the
newsgroup by maiking one of the mail2news gateways a subscriber.

No vote is needed to create an alt.group: something like
'alt.security.cypherpunks' or 'alt.privacy.cypherpunks'. Just post a proposal
to alt.config, post many articles seconding the proposal, let it be discussed
for a week, then issue a newgroup.

To create a newsgroup in the 'big 8' (comp., sci., etc) one needs to deal with
unpleasant control freaks like group-advice, news.groups, and David Lawrence.
It takes up to 6 months. On the other hand, many sites that have Usenet have
comp.* but not alt.*. Their users would still have to use the mailing lists or
find another site. To create something like comp.security.cypherpunks (I think
this would be the most appropriate place, since there's already c.s.announce,
c.s.misc, and c.s.firewalls), talk to the group-advice cabal.
