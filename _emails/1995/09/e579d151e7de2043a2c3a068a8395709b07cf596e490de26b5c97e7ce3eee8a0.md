I've seen Notes running -- the Major-name discount software chain I used 
to work for (peon level) used it for communications.  It was slow and 
frustrating, but my access to it was only marginal... I certainly hadn't 
a chance to examine the code with a debugger, or even just play with it 
some.  But, knowing the software, it wouldn't surprise me if there were 
some serious bugs in the security code.

Exactly... I think the product is guilty of security through obscurity, 
though I'm not sure it's particularly intended, just merely an artifact 
of the marketing strategy...

Agreed.  OTOH, before the Web was known, it made a lot of sense for 
corporations...
