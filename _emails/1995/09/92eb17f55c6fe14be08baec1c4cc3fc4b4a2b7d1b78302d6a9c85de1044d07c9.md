Which of our rights would you have us surrender so as to not play into the
government's hands?

You would have a hard time proving that cryptography has more, or
different "net benefits to society" than gun ownership does.

by the government is not what a statist wants to hear - and neither
is talk about the real reason behind the 2nd Amendment.
