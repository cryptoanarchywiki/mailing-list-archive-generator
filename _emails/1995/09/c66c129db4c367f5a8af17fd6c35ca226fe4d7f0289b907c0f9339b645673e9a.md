Well, I wasn't saying one had a legal right to kill a person either
trespassing or stealing, I was saying that electrified fences carrying
lethal voltages are extant. How they got that way, and what licenses are
involved, is unknown to me. But they do exist.

Cattle fences are not what I was talking about. I have an electrified fence
on one side of my property, to keep the deer away. Lethal voltage fences,
to keep humans out, are another matter.

Different strokes for different folks. Anyone entering my house unannounced
faces lethal response. I think of it as evolution in action, and doubt I
would lose any sleep over this.

It has nothing to do with equating human life over property, it has to do
with defending one's property and (maybe) one's life. Here in California,
it is becoming more and more common for "home invasions" to be followed by
execution of all of the witnesses. (Read "The San Jose Mercury News" for
accounts of gang invasions in which all the residents in a home are lined
up and shot, excecution-style.)

I won't get into a discussion of which states permit lethal force
responses, as this is a topic which even I think belongs in
talk.politics.guns or similar fora.

Suffice it to say that most states allow lethal response under threatening
circumstances.
