You know, if one person, just one person, uses that remailer, they may
think he's just paranoid, and they'll ignore him.

And if two people, two people, do it -- in reply to each other--they may
think they're both crooks but they won't be able to bust either of
them. And if THREE people do it.  Three -- Can you imagine three people
loggin' in, sending mail through Alice's Remailer site and loggin' out?
They may think it's an ORGANIZATION!

And can you imagine FIFTY people a day?  I said FIFTY people a day --
loggin' in, sending mail through Alice's Remailer site and loggin' out?
And friends, they may think it's a MOVEMENT, and that's what it is:

      THE ALICE'S REMAILER SITE ANTI-E-MAIL-SNIFFING MOVEMENT!--

and all you gotta do to join is to flip the bird to those traffic-sniffin'
spooks out there -- With feelin' ...
