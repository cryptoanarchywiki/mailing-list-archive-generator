-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

It has been brought to my attention that the phone number supplied to
me by Michael Paul Johnson for his Catacombs BBS which appeared here
in a previous announcement was incorrect.

The correct number is 303-772-1062.  Other information in the
announcement is correct.
