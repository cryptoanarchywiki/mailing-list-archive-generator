But don't they have to put something on the patent application?  Can they
claim trade secret status for something that was on a patent application,
but rejected?  That seems like they're getting it both ways.  They should
probably have to choose whther or not they want to show anyone their
"secret".  If not, it stays a trade secret.  If so, it's not a secret anymore,
and they hope it's "nonobvious, etc." enough to be granted a patent.

		   to multiply numbers of the same parity.  Can anyone verify this
		   and/or produce a reference?"
