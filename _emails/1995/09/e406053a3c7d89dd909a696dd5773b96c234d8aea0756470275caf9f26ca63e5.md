	Here's an article on the RSA-Cylink arbitration from the
	business wire.

[ ... elided -JMH ]

Just a note for those who aren't aware, Business Wire is a pay-per-use
"news release" service.  That is, RSA wrote the contents of what Bob
(Hi!) posted.

The clue is at the bottom of the "story":

	CONTACT: RSA
	Kurt Stammberger, 415/595-8782
	kurt@rsa.com

This is not to say anything pro or con about the content of the press
release; just that it wasn't written by a third party.
