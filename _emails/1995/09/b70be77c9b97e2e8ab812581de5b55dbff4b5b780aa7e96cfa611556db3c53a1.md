I, of course, know of the "dislike" of GAK here.  I am curious to know, 
however, if the "dislike" is because government would have access under 
any circumstances or if the primary worry is that government will cheat 
and get access when most would agree that they shouldn't (either by the 
judge "cheating" or a TLA stealing it).

In other words ... if it took agreement by a review board composed of 
non-LEA members of this list, would the escrow be acceptable??
