I can't speak for Netscape in particular, but from bitter personal experience 
(in a previous life) I would  be more willing to bet that bringing such a flaw

to management's attention would raise the priority a bit to perhaps just below

whatever their equivalent of the 'cut line' is.  The rationale: "we are so 
resource limited;  can't just keep it under wraps and fix it in the next
release?" 
just rings in my ears.

I can really empathize with what the developers at Netscape must be going
through, but the 'social good' of raising security flaws to the level of the 
front page of the NYT is hard to deny.  Rather than saying "security through
obscurity is bad" you can point to a precedent of the consequences of being 
found out.
