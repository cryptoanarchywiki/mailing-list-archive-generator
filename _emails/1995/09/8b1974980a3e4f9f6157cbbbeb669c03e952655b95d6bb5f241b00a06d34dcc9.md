This was Stockbridge, in MA, right :-?

	        That's what we did, and drove back to the church, had a
	thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep and didn't
	get up until the next morning, when we got a phone call from officer
	Obie.  Said "Kid, we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a
	half a ton of garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any
	information bout it". I said "Yes Sir Officer Obie, I cannot tell a
	lie, I put that envelope under that garbage."
