Well I've vaccilated between making a formal, dry announcement or
letting you all know my way. Given the general tenor (and individual
spirit) of many on Toad it is pretty easy to guess which path I chose.

So, first of all, here is to a productive future for encryption and
encryption technologies. Consensus Development and RSA Data Security,
have finalized the contract for Consensus to license and support
RSAREF(tm) for commercial use.

This isn't an advertisement for RSAREF -- as we are seeking to first
present our license to those who have already expressed interest in
the product to 'beta-test' our standard agreement. Meanwhile, we would
like to gather some information from the net community.

Our foremost concern is for those who have been using RSAREF in
the past. If you have discovered any bugs which have either gone
unreported or unfixed, we need to know ASAP. No bugs have been
officially reported in version 2.0, however we have heard in the
past that some may have been found. If a report has gotten lost
during this period of transition, we'd like to know. Consensus'
first priority is to make sure RSAREF is bug free.

Secondly, for those who have contributed code to RSAREF in the
past, or have code they'd like to submit, send email to me at the
address below. Our hope is that RSAREF will continue to improve
and meet the needs of its users through the co-support of both
Consensus Development and our commercial and non-commercial
RSAREF developers.

Lastly, we would like to hear suggestions and ideas on how to
improve RSAREF. We intend to remain responsive to requests, and
welcome ideas for the evolution of the RSAREF toolkit.

Anyway, again, have a good day. For those who would like to be
on our RSAREF announcement list, send mail to
<RSAREF-Ann-L@consensus.com> with 'Subscribe' in the Subject
header.

Note: RSAREF is a trademarked term by RSA Data Security

Thank you all for your patience, I'm sure many will be as excited
as I am.
