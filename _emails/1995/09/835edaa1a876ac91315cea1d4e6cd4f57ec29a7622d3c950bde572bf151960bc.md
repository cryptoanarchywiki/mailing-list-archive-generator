I absolutely agree with this, though this doesn't mean I'll stop worrying
about the government's plans for key escrow (GAK), about limits on key
lengths, or about other efforts to thwart strong security.

But clearly the "technologies of surveillance," ranging from
massively-cross-correlated mailing lists to smaller and cheaper and more
ubiquitous video cameras, are very nearly an equal threat.

(Lots of issues, from the nearly universal requests for Social Security
Numbers, to the growing powers of courts to compel the disclosure of
private documents, to, well, you folks all know the trends.)

Folks like us should not be lobbying for limitations on what other private
individuals or companies are doing, but should concentrate first, on
technological alternatives (encryption, unlinkable credentials, digital
money, that sort of thing) and second, on educating others that security
and privacy is best self-arranged and is rarely accomplished by government
assuming the role of protector.
