That is what I heard (implied) too. If not today, in a reasonably
foreseeable future. Remember, this is not an issue today, only weirdos
such as the c'punks care today. The govies move slowly. They are
setting the stage for tomorrow.

Sorry for the typo, yes, I meant sham, fake, theater, all smoke  and
mirrors, nothing sincere, etc. See reference to "stage" above.

All typos are mine.
