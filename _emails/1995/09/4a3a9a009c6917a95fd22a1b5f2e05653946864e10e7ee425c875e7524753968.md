Hi.

Some time ago, there were some discussions concerning an
anonymous http daemon.  As far as I can recall, the discussion
just sort of trailed off, and nothing got implemented.

I'm considering making an anonymous server available, and
would like:
   1. to know whether I need to hack some code
      (or if someone has done so already)
   2. to reopen the discussion of the desirable
      characteristics such a beast would possess.
