To name some more names mentioned as being NAPs under surveillance:
Pennsauken, NJ (Sprint); Chicago (AmeriTech/Bell Comms. Research);
San Francisco, CA (Pacific Bell); CIX, CA (San Jose); SWAB, North Virginia
(Bell Atlantic).

There is a rather worrying quote in the article about NASA capturing data
for the NSA.

The column closes with a comparison to a case where the NSA was almost
prosecuted by the US Justice Dept. in the '70s for anti-Vietnam War
group surveillence.

The article appeared in "Computer Fraud & Security", June 1995.
American editor is:
Charles Cresson Wood
information Integrity Investments
Sausalito, CA, USA
The article in question, titled
"Puzzle Palaze Conducting Internet Surveillance" is by Wayne Madsen of
Virginia.  No Internet E-mail address listed for either of the American
contriubtors mentioned above.
