Of corse you can do what I have been doing for years:

$cookie=`good-source-or-random-hex-strings`
xauth add $DISPLAY MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 $cookie
xinit ~/.xinitrc $DISPLAY -- $server :$port -auth $XAUTHORITY

(assuming you set the various variables correctly)

This will allow you to gennerate your own cookies rather then
relying on MIT.  (I actually have C code to set the cookie dirrectly,
since I don't really care to have it visable to ps, even breifly).

Unfortunitly X will blat the "secret" out in the clear every time you
make an X connection, so it still isn't very good.
