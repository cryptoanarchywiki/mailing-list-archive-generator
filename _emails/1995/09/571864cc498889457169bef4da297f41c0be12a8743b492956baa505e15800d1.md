I've only ever seen the problem with Content-Type: application/pgp using
Sun's mailtool.  I don't know that I've ever gotten mail with unknown 
Content-Type though...wait let me whip some up...

Mailtool assumes anything with a content type is an attachment.  The
type is used as the name of the attachment.  A Content-Type: of 
application/foo or of just foo both yeild an attachment named foo.
