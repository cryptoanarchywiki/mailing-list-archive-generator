What exactly does a ban on import of "defense articles and services" 
which are not in "furtherance of world peace" mean?

Could you ban crypto imports?  Imports of chopped liver?


---------- Forwarded message ----------

Here is a final rule issued by ATF regarding the import of "defense articles"
into the United States.  It appears in the Federal Register at 60 FR 47866
(9/15/950).  This becomes a regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations,
Title 27 CFR, part 47, Importation of Arms.

	Sec. 47.52 Import restricitons applicable to certain countries.

	(a)	It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses
	and other approvals with respect to defense articles and defense
	services originating in certain countries or areas.  This policy
	applies to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mongolia, North Korea, Sudan,
	Syria, Vietnam, and the States that comprise the former Soviet
	Union [list of countries omitted].

	This policy applies to countries or areas with respect to which
	the United States maintains an arms embargo [list of countries
	omitted].
        
        It also applies when an import would not be in furtherance of
        world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United
        States.
