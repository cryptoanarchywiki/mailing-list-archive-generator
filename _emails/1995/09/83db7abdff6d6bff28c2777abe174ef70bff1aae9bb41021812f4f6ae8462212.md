What's technology got to do with it, in principle?  If
I write a letter in code, do I have to send the FBI the
key, just in case?

I don't see anything complicated about this--Director
Freeh wants more wiretapping ability than he's got now,
and I have no doubt that that expansion of FBI power
would be good for national security and law enforcement.

So would an FBI camcorder in every room of every house.
The question is where to draw the line, and I'd rather
let the lines draw themselves, as opposed to having 
citizens be compelled to draw them.  The telephone
system, Mr. Freeh's preferred analog, is inherently
susceptible to tapping, but what if it were not, and
every telephone were required to be equipped with
a government tap switch, subuect to warrant, of course?

I don't think I'd like that.  Would you?
