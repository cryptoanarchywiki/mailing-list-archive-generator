I seem to recall a lawsuit where somebody like Tandy was suing
somebody else, claiming they copied the computer's rom code.

As proof they pulled out the competitors computer, pressed a
certain key combination, and the Tandy copyright flashed up on
the screen. As I also recall, they LOST the suit believe it or
not...

Anybody heard of this? Cerca 1988-1991 I believe. Sure shows
what a slick lawyer can get you out of...
