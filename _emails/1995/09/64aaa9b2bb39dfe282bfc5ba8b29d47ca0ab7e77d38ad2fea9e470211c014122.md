Hello C-Punks,

I recently found a company called "sled corp" at
<http://www.411.com/> 

they are a white pages directory service (who i have absolutely no
relationship with) that claims they will sign someone's pgp key for
$20/year. to verify the identity of the person's key they are
signing, they require either 1) a mailed or faxed copy of a driver's
license,  2) mailed or faxed copy of a passport,   or 3) a preprinted
personal check (which cleared).

i'm not sure how much i would trust this type of signature anyway, as
all 3 of the above methods of identification can be easily forged,
but i'd appreciate some comments by some of the folks out there that
have considered the concept of key signatures. 

if anyone has had any dealings with this company, i would appreciate
any comments on them. 

feel free to contact me privately if you'd like at either
