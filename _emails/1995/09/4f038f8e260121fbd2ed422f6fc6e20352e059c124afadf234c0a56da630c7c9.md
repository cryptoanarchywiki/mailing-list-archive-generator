Some of the following is probably idiotically obvious, but to prevent an 
attack on such a time keeper, it could be tied in to the atomic clocks, 
it could poll several PC's and check their time... any significant major 
time change would be spotted immediatly...  that is you couldn't possibly 
change the time on many machines at the same time without having physical 
access to all the machines, etc.  Altering the time on an atomic clock 
would be visible to just about everyone, etc.

This in now way would prevent an attacker from stealing the passphrase to 
the time signing service, so it wouldn't prevent anyone from issuing 
false keys.  But by using a hardware random generator the time keeping 
service could know if it issued a key or not by storing all the keys it 
issued previously.

This would achive the following: even if a theif stole the key, with 
enough randomization, the stolen keys would show up as valid, but would 
not show up in the time server's database - which should be written to 
write-once-media such as worm, or CDROM, etc...  the stolen key would 
generate valid time signatures, but would not be on the database, so it 
would be clear it was forged.  To get around this, the bad guy would need 
constant physical access to the time keeper, not just a single black bag 
job.

This also means that this database must be publically searchable at all 
times.  Perhaps the generator phassphrase should also be changed randomly 
as time passes - but then these things too would have to be stored 
somewhere before the time the key expires...

This is probably a bit far fetched, but the time keeper could be tied 
into astronomical events - that is have it follow the path of planets, 
star systems, etc. and derrive time that way and compare it with what 
time it thinks it is.  This would require quite a lot of sensors and 
extra hardware to track stars, planets, etc...   The bad guy would have 
to do a lot more work to get around this...  basically what you want to 
do is track some totally unalterable event to keep track of time, and we 
presume the NSA cannot change the orbits of planets... yet. ;-)


Another method would be to set up a key breaking system which would 
accept weaker keys - say 300 bits or so, and start breaking them.  This 
wouldn't guarantee they wouldn't be broken before such and such time, and 
wouldn't prevent anyone from running their own on faster hardware, or 
building special hardware optimized to break it faster though...  but 
without the private key, the only way to break it would be to brute force 
it.
