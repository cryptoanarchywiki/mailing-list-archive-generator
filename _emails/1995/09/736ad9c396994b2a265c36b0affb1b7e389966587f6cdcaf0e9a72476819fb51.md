And from what the folks at the Export Controls division of the Department 
of External Affairs in Ottawa told me, Canadians can't export 
export-controlled American software, including pgp and other freeware, 
without a license. OTOH we can export non-US=origin software license-free
(well freeware for sure, anyway, I didn't get the whole thing quite right). 

Of course there are a few countries for which you would need a license,
and some UN embargoed countries to which you can't make any exports (both 
sets are dictatorships or warzones, so not much net access anyway and the 
crypto laws would make France's look cpunk).

They're also waiting to see what happens to Phil Z. to decide whether or not
ftp's are exports. All the same, if anyone wants an easy and economical
way to get around ITAR, have someone do your cypto software development 
just north of the border (Vancouver's just north of Seattle and close 
enough to Silicon Valley, with excellent net-access) or at least just
publish it here first. Phil could have saved himself an immense amount of 
trouble with a short car ride. You Americans on the list could too.

Wanna nag your bosses some more Jeff? You'd be doing everyone a favor and
get your wish.

You can get "A guide to Canada's export controls" from:
