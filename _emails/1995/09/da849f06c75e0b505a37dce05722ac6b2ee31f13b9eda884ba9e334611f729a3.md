   SAIC TEAM TO DEVELOP MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR
   FBI IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM
   
   (MCLEAN, VA,) August 23, 1994 -- SAIC (Science Applications
   International Corporation) has won a major contract to 
design and
   develop the FBI's Interstate Identification Index computer 
system.
   This system is an on-line criminal history database which 
will support
   federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies via the 
National
   Crime Information Center network.
   
   Under the 8-year contract, the SAIC team will design, 
implement, and
   provide operations and maintenance support for the 
Interstate
   Identification Index. The contract has an estimated value of 
$27.6
   million.
   
   "The Interstate Identification Index project contributes to 
our
   company's goals to provide quality technical products and 
services for
   the security and well-being of our nation," said SAIC 
Project Manager
   Shelley Parker. "SAIC has been working for the FBI in this 
area for
   the last 10 years. Our expertise and personal commitment to 
this
   program made it particularly important to the company."
   
   Development and integration work will be performed in SAIC's 
Software
   and System Integration Group in the McLean, VA facility by a 
team of
   engineers who have worked for many years on this 
application. The team
   will be augmented by new staff members with specialized 
expertise for
   the new system.
   
   SAIC provides innovative services and products to government 
and the
   private sector in the areas of systems integration, energy,
   environment and transportation. The company, which is the 
largest
   employee-owned high-technology firm in the nation, has 
annual revenues
   of $1.67 billion and 16,000 employees in more than 250 
locations
   worldwide.
