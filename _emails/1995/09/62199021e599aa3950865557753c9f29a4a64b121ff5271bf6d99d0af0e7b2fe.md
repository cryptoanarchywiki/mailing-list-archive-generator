Just to announce that I have a new address.  No more VAX/VMS, hello Unix.
Donations of nice procmail files, and unix hints for the re-clueless 
(I last had an account on a Unix machine in 1980), most welcome.

If you send me mail in the next few days and I don't reply, it's either 
because I fiddled wrong, or because I couldn't find a terminal in Pittsburg.
