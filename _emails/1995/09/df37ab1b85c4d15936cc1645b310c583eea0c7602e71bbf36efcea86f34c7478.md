The _consensus_ here seems to be: "This t-shirt is illegal to wear in front
of non-Americans," judging by the comments here.

The _reality_ is quite different, I think, and the "this shirt is illegal"
hype is, in my opinion, just that, hyperbole. Even hyperbull, too.

Books and written articles containing crypto algorithms are _not_ illegal
for "furriners" to look at. The t-shirt contains at most a fuzzy printing
of an algorithm that has been widely printed in various books and in
articles in mailing lists like ours.

(I agree that there are some unresolved issues with ostensibly
machine-readable forms. The t-shirt is not machine-readable by any
plausible interpretation of machine-readable.)

Ian did great work on the latest Netscape break, but this is just plain crazy.
