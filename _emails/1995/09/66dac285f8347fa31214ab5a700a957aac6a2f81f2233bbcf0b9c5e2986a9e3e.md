Does this mean that if I have a link to Infoseek or
another search engine, that I, too, am hosting
pornography?  

Which would be an interesting idea as far as trying to
present a "safe" way to search the Internet.  A web-
crawler or other search mechanism of choice could be started
up, and simply refuse to run searches for certain keywords.
Ideally (but impractical) any pages dug up that contain
the questionable words could be manually checked.
