   "VeriFone Expected to Announce System For Purchasing Goods
   on the Internet."

      VeriFone, Inc., which manufactures terminals through
      which merchants scan consumers' credit cards for
      authorization, said it will provide merchants who wish
      to market goods on the global computer network with a
      complete set of tools to handle electronic cash,
      electronic checks and credit-card payments. The system
      consists of four different products: A consumer would
      use the software equivalent of a wallet, which could
      include different forms of payment, such as electronic
      checks, cash, or credit cards to purchase goods. The
      consumer would also use a smartcard inserted in a device
      connected to a PC to verify his identity. The card would
      also contain other cardholder information and eventually
      could include electronic cash.


   Philips and Oracle Plan Electronic Mail Without Use of PCs

      Philips Electronics NV and Oracle Corp. plan to offer
      electronic mail without personal computers, using
      Philips phones that have small display screens and
      keyboards. Gerrit Schipper, president of Philips Home
      Services, said the new e-mail service was designed to
      increase the services' value and appeal to the 70% of
      U.S. households that don't have PCs.
