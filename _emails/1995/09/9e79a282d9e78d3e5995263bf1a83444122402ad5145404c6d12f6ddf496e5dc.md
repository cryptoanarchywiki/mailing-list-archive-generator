All out espionage should, idealy at least, only take place if there is
evidence that a nations indipendance is directly involved. By this I mean
active methods versus passive eavesdropping. It is one thing to send aloft

actively insert agents provocateur.

What are its estimates on what US business gains with its present industrial
espionage infrastructure? Without these numbers the quoted above are
useless.
