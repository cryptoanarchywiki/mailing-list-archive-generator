Absolutely. We aren't on a vendetta. We want to make the net secure for
privacy. If hacking a Netscape server will help that goal, surely
Netsape's own would be the most appropriate server to try, since it will
generate the largest exposure in the press and thereby the strongest
motivation for Netscape to fix the hole.
