I worked at a DoD contractor for a while, and there was a DoD-approved 
method of disposing of hard drives, which was expensive, laborious,
and rather silly.
 
We just had two witnesses watch as we smashed it to smithereens 
(technical term) with a sledge hammer, and then handed the parts over
to an approved disposal person (trash man).
 
It's JUST that easy.
