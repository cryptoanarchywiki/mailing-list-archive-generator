| Of course, an organized campaign on the Net is essentially free,
| but for the cost in time.  It is my opinion that the political power
| of the Net is just starting to awaken, and that a perception of
| impotence in the political process, is just that - a perception.

	An organized campaign anywhere, for any purpose, is not free,
since it will require good people to run and organize it.  The Key
cracking ring only did what we all knew it could do becuase Hal, Adam
and several other good folks took the time to do it.
