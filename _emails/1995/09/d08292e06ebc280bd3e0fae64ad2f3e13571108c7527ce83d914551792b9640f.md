Many technologies have both patented parts and trade secret parts.  Often, 
companies will maintain information that is in patent applications as trade 
secret until they are granted.  I guess I should say _if_ they are granted! 
 After a patent is granted, it is usually a good idea to also maintain some 
trade secrets in your products -- since trade secrets never "expire," unlike 
patents.  If the patent isn't granted, you still have the option of treating 
the contents as an intellectual property under trade secret protection.
