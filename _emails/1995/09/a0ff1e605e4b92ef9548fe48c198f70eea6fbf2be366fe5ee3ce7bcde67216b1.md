Adam, 

I called RSA last week to get information on licensing Diffie-Hellmann
for an videoconferencing application.  They said that "They provide
the BSAFE development toolkit, but don't license the technology" and
gave me the number of PKP to license the technology itself.  I called
a Mr. Fougmer at PKP, (408 735-5893), his message says that he'll be
out of town until the 18th of September, and if you want to leave a
message, call back after that date.

Now, I could be completely confused, it wouldn't be the first (or
even the 100th) time.  If you can get a standard license by using
the BSAFE toolkit, and they had a standard price for that, well,
I didn't give Linda De Los Reyes at RSA (415 595-8782) a chance
to tell me that.
