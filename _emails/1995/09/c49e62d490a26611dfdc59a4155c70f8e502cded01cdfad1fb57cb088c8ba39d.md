Indeed, Jim is underscoring the point I was making, facetiously, that the
NSA has abandoned all pretense of helping to actually secure commercial
transactions (and no, I wasn't referring to Clipper...rather, I was
facetiously referring to the short-lived Commercial COMSEC Endorsement
Program, circa 1988-89).

As I said in my message, I don't _want_ the NSA or NIST (the same, really)
to be vetting commercial encryption. But I also don't want them claiming a
role in securing commercial encryption when they clearly are not even doing
as much as the Cypherpunks are doing.

By the way, if we count our own Matt Blaze's work on exposing weaknesses of
the Tessera/Skipjack/Clipper (they blur together) card as a "Cypherpunks
achievement," then the Cypherpunks have actually played a dominant role in
cracking these recent standards. (Not to mention the RC4 code postings, the
various Cypherpunks involved in the RSA-129 and "BlackNet" factorizations,
etc.)

Well done, of course!
