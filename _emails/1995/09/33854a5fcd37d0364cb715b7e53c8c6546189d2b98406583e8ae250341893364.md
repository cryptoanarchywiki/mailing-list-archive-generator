        As a response to this example.  I'd argue Mallet has less of a
reputation because:
        (1) if this example applies to the first 10 questions from each
person, Alice will answer many more questions that Mallet.  (Mallet answers
10 and is done.)
        (2) if this example means the first 10 questions from anywhere
Mallet than has to arrange to have his customer's 10 questions in the queue
and ready to go before any other person can get in the queue, which is some
work.
        
        In general, I'd think reputation is akin to brand name to a degree.
Differentiation!  So, if Alice notices people tracking her "reputation
advertising" she can change it.  Reputation might not be as static a concept
as we think (as others have mentioned by bringing up arbitrage.)
