Somebody mentioned the possibility of using the a/d stage of a sound card 
as a source of random bits, and that brought a thought back to mind: 
given that a lot of sound cards are now shipping with DSP chips on board, 
has anyone written any code that uses the cards DSP to accelerate RSA 
processing? 

Maybe there's a mass market market for a crypto-blaster- an RNG, 3 or 6 
DES chips, and a DSP. It would make for a killer linux based SHTTP server...
