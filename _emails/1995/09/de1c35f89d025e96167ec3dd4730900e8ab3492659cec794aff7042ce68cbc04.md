Schneier describes the "cave" analogy in his book, on p. 85, and gives a
reference:

Quisquater, Guilou, Berson, "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge Protocols to
your Children," Advances in Cryptology--CRYPTO '89 Proceedings.

The paper is only a couple of pages long and would make a nice scan project
for someone, as it has no equations.

But Schneier is the easiest way to read up on it.
