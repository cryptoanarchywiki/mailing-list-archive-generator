This just came up locally, and I'd like to have some comments on it, 
especially from people who understand the law a lot better than I do:

Our local University apparently has been logging ALL mail to anon.penet,
including faculty, students, and off-campus users.

They maintain such weak security that someone was able to "obtain"
the logs and post them to a local usenet group, thus compromising
everyone's "anonymous" identities.
