I am an editor at a business technology publication and am currently 
researching a piece on network security at financial institutions as well as 
the feasability of secure Internet transactions and banking on the world wide 
web. 

I will be interviewing individuals who can speak to these issues and can talk 
about whether the banking industry can in fact move much of its activity on 
line without risking the loss of billions of dollars to online theft and other 
related damage.  

If you are familiar with this subject matter and/or have any experience in the 
financial industry, please email me at: cprince@mfi.com

Thanks,

CJ Prince
