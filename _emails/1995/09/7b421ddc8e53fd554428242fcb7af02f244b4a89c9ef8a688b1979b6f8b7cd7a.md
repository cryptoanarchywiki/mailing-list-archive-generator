I've received several of these, not just the one Travis sent.

I don't sign my messages, never have, so I see no way this "agent" Travis
ran could find such a signed message from me.m (It's conceivable he found
an old--really old--message with a faked-up sig, as perhaps for a
demonstration or spoof I was doing, but I'm skeptical. In any case, I
suspect only an "automated searcher" could find the one or two messages
that may look like this. If Travis produces the message here, I'm sure this
will be what the situation is.)

Like I said, I don't sign messages. My PGP 2.0 key was signed at the second
CP meeting and, they tell me, submitted on the original MIT ring.
"tcmay@netcom.com" was my e-mail address at that time.

Ignore it. Why hassle people who have no plan or finger configurations? (I
don't have a shell account.) Besides, people who really want to communicate
with me with PGP simply ask for it.

If you don't like this, fine. But don't robo-interrogate and send robo-warnings.
