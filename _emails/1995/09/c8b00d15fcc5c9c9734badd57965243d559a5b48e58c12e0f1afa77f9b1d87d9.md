F|If all Alice's prospective customers are also resellers on the side, then I

 |a new supplier cannot positively identify some legitimate end consumers of a
 |product or service ?  (I'm ignoring cases in which the market for the
 |product or service is only just being forged.)  This strikes me as rather
 |implausible, although I don't claim to have devoted a great deal of thought
 |to it.

        Hey, Wei, you overlooked something rather simple: suppose
        Alice wasn't any good?  Or suppose she was good, in general,
        but came up wrong at a bad time?  Whereas she might have
        corrected it in time if it had been her client and she had
        direct access, Mallet gets hit broadside out of ignorance--
        and the resulting delay from the extra link in the chain
        could easily be enough to ruin him.
