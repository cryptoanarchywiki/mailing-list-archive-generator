In my case, it's simply a matter of principle: the government has no
right to know what I'm saying.  Search warrants may allow them to
get to "things" that I have, but the First and Fifth amendments make
words sacred.  If the government can eavesdrop on my conversation,
then my speech is no longer free.

A review board consisting of cypherpunks has no more right to listen
to my private conversations than does the FBI, so I would not agree
to that proposal either.
