On my 486 running Windoze for Workgroups 3.11 and the latest Netscape Beta
it causes Netscape to die but doesn't lock me up.  

Generally I've found Netscape blows up in a much firendlier way than other
Windoze programs.  I can often recover the Netscape session itself and it
doesn't lock me up as much.
