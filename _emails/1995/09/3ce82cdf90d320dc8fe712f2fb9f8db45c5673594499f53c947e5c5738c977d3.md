	Now that we've seen that Netscape is doing a good job towards
trying to fix the hole that Ian and David have uncovered, it's time to
start looking at new things.

	Given the recent post to the www-security list that was
forwarded here, it seems like just replacing the server may not work
for all the secure servers out there-- keys may have to be replaced as
well. Let's find out.

Proposal for action:

1) Reverse-engineer a server to see if the keygen phase uses
a weak RNG seed. -- if so, determine the exact algorithim.

2) Organize a net-wide search over the space of the RNG seed to 
crack the private key of some well known secure server.

3) Release the private key to the net.
