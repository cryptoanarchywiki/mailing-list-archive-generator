-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I recently promised to release the next version of Mixmaster (V 2.0.2)
within 48 hours. The situation has changed. The release of the next
version
of Mixmaster will be indefinitely delayed.

There has been an offer to purchase and commercially develop Mixmaster.
This will hasten the development of Mixmaster for other platforms (e.g.
Dos, Windows  Macintosh), and bring significant improvements to the
interface, but I will not compromise on the level of security provided by
Mixmaster. Free client software will continue to be available.

This could be the big breakthrough for remailers, finally thrusting them
out of the hobbyist's closet into the corporate world. We have all known
that remailers would not become widely used by the rest of the word until
they were easy to use. Many corporations also fear freeware because of its
unknown provenance and its lack of support.

I apologize for the delay, but I think that the wait will be worth it.
