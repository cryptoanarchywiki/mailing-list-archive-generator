Assuming your cellphone operates in the 800 MHz range, transmitting with 
about 1 W., I think you're out of luck.

With UHF and particularly at low power levels, you just about have to be 
line-of-sight to the receiving antenna. Guessing how high up your antenna 
might be and how high the receiving antenna could be, I would say you 
would be lucky to achieve a range of 20 miles.  I'd be astonished at 
anything over 50.
