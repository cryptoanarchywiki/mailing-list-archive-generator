S/MIME was developed privately by RSA in conjunction with a number of other
companies. To the best of my knowledge all discussion has occurred on closed,
private lists. As a potential customer of RSA I recently managed to get myself
added to one of these lists (it may or may not be the only one where S/MIME is
discussed) but I haven't had time to post anything there yet. I plan to post
this message there in the next couple of days.

I'm not saying this approach to protocol development is a good thing or a bad
thing, but I do believe that it has led to the production of a specification
that is seriously flawed, and that those flaws would have been detected and
probably corrected had the discussion been more public.
More on this below.

The specification, at least, is public. Given the amount of press surrounding
this proposal and the strong liklihood of it being widely used I strongly
recommend that everyone who is interested in email security obtain a
copy of the specification and read it.

However, the proposal is simple enough that it can be summarized in just two
paragraphs. S/MIME is based on PKCS #7, which in turn is based on classic PEM.
The significant difference between PKCS #7 and PEM is that it uses an ASN.1
encoding for the entire security object rather than the header/text encoding of
RFC1421. In fact the specification states that mechanical conversion between
RFC1421 formats and PKCS #7 should be possible as long as the proper set of
algorithms are used. I think that mechanical conversion into and out of the
PEM-derived subset of MOSS is also feasible but I haven't checked up on the
specifics of this.

S/MIME in turn is a simple encapsulation of PKCS #7 in MIME, consisting of  an
application subtype label and an encoding of the PKCS #7 object using standard
MIME encodings. The inner secured content is then seen as another MIME object.
This is almost identical to Jeff Schiller's earlier proposal for embedding PEM
in MIME. There is only one significant twist -- in the case of signed but not
encrypted data the specification calls for the use of multipart/alternative,
with the first part being an unsigned copy of the signed data and the second
part being the PKCS #7 object, including the signed data.

Two obvious flaws in this approach should be obvious from this description. The
first is simply one of excessive overhead -- sending signed material in such a
way that it can be read on vanilla email systems as well as with an S/MIME
system introduces something on the order of 133% overhead.

The second flaw is more serious. The data that a user without S/MIME reads is
not signed. This opens the door to attacks where the unsigned version is
tampered with but the signed version is left alone.

This turns into a really insidious problem when you consider how privacy
services are likely to be deployed in some environments. One model I expect to
be rather popular is that of having a remote signature verification service
within a secure enclave. That is, most of the user agents that people use won't
have the ability to validate a signature. Users will, however, have secure
access to an agent that will validate the signature on a message for them. (The
service may well be a different application on the same machine.) They simply
submit the message to this service and it tells them whether or not the
signature matches.

The problem, of course, is that the material the user of the unextended agent
reads isn't what's signed. And in general there is no way to correlate this
material with the signed copy -- since it was exposed to the message transport
layer without any special tagging to indicate its signed nature the transport
may well have changed it so its no longer a byte-for-byte copy of the signed
version (which is inherently protected against such munging). 

Comparing this approach with security multiparts is quite instructive. Security
multiparts only introduces the overhead necessary to encode the single copy of
the data -- at most 33% in the case of base64 -- plus of course the fixed
overhead of the signature information. As such, it is far more efficient than
S/MIME when it comes to signed but unencrypted material. Security multiparts
can be processed in a single pass as well. I'm not sure this is true of S/MIME
-- it depends on the specifics of the ASN.1 structure that's used. But by far
the most important difference is that security multiparts do not suffer from
this vulnerability when used in an environment with remote security servers. 

You can of couse avoid this problem by not including the extra copy of the
signed material. The problem with this approach is that you won't be able to
read such a message on anything short of an agent that knows how to take apart
a PKCS #7 structure.

I note in passing that there was absolutely no reason why security multiparts
could not have been used in S/MIME instead of the chosen encapsulation. PKCS #7
explicitly provides a facility whereby the secured data is stored outside of
the ASN.1 object. This then fits seamlessly into the security multiparts
methodology.

I do not propose to debate the relative merits of PKCS #7 versus MOSS. Modulo
the MIME issues this is essentially the same as debating the merits of PEM
versus MOSS, and I've had more of that than I care for. Besides, I think folks
should use whatever security service they feel like using. I've maintained all
along that my interest is primarily that of standardizing on a single embedding
methodology for use with MIME. I'm very disappointed that S/MIME has seen fit
to use what to my mind is a technically inferior embedding solution when
compared to security multiparts, and I'd really like to try to get the S/MIME
folks to switch to a security multiparts approach if its not too late for them
to do so.

I'm very interested in any and all comments on what I've written here. I intend
to post them to the S/MIME list I'm now on.
