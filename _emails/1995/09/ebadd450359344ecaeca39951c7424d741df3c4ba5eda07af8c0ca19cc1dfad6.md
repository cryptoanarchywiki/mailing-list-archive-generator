> The proposal would make telecomms operators responsible for decrypting

> `change national laws to enable judicial authorities to chase hackers
> across borders'.
> 
> Opposition to this measure was expressed by Mike Strezbek, VP
> responsible for European telecomms at JP Morgan, who said that his
> organisation `will challenge any attempt to limit the power of our
> network encryption technologies very strongly'.

> Czonka said that the Council had given consideration to business

> Apparently another international organisation, the OECD, has called a

> John Major stated in a 1994 parliamentary written reply to David Shaw
> MP that the government did not intend to legislate on data encryption.
> I am disppointed that government policy has changed to the point of
