...or "somebody else" (ie commercial competitor, personal or political 
rival, etc) paying off somebody to obtain it.  I don't trust the gvm't to

Not necessarily; the members of the review board can be bribed, 
blackmailed, lied to, etc.  I don't believe there's a competent review 
board available...nor do I think such a thing could be created.
