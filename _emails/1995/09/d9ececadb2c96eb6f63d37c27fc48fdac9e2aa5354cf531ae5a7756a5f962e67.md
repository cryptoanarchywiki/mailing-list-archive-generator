Indeed, if a majority of folks on this list start calling themselves
"Martians" or "Crypto Tools," then I suppose this list will _gradually_
adopt that name. Though even then there are no guarantees, as this list is
run on a machine not controlled by a list democracy.

Go for it! If you wish the folks on this list to call themselves "Concerned
Citizens for Cryptographic Freedom," then start calling yourself that.

What I think would be a waste of everyone's time is a drawn-out series of
proposals for new names, a debate which is unlikely in the extreme to
result in a new name.

Indeed, some people here have been calling themselves by various names
("CypherGeek," "Crypto Rebel," etc.) for a long time. Personally, I despise
the terms "geek," "dweeb," and "nerd," and think anyone who calls
themselves by these insults is not "reclaiming and deconstructing the
labels of the oppressor class," as the slogan goes, but is merely insulting
themselves. Blacks who call themselves "niggers," homosexuals who call
themselves "queers," and computer programmers who call themselves "geeks"
and "dorks" are all playing the same game.

The problem is not a "leadership dynamic," the problem is that name changes
are not easily arranged. With 700 people on this list, many of whom appear
to _like_ the name, how long will it take before enough want to change to
make it so? And who says democracy is such a good thing? What if 200 want
to change, 100 don't, and the rest don't care or don't "vote"?

A better approach is for the "conservatives" who want a "more conservative"
name to simply do what I suggested: form a new group and name it what they
like. They wouldn't have to quit this list, they would just be able to
cleanly recruit for their new list.

Seems simple to me. And honest. And less devisive than trying to change the
name of a group with a long history (by modern standards) and with several
well-known achievements.
