Can someone tell me how to run PGPfone over Appletalk ? The
documentation says that support has been added for this release, and
there's a preferences box to check to use it, but there's no information
I can find in the documentation on how to initiate a call over
Appletalk.. it just says to enter a telephone number to dial. If I 
press 'Connect' without entering anything it hangs up the Mac.

How do I tell it which machine I want to connect to ?
