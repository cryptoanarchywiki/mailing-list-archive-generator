	 Netscape Software for Cruising Internet Is Found to
		      Have Another Security Flaw

Another security flaw that has long plagued the Internet has been
found in software by Netscape Communications Corp. and others, raising
concerns for the privacy and safety of information on the global
computer network.

The flaw in Netscape's popular Navigator software, which helps users
cruise the multimedia portion of the Internet known as the World Wide
Web, is the third defect in the software discovered by the
"Cypherpunks" discussion group in little over a month.

[end of excerpt--it's a long article]

The article quotes William Cheswick and Rich Lethin, and mentions the
cypherpunks several times.
