This seems not to be the case.
See: http://www.communities.com/foo/bad.html (which contains these
bytes fairly early in the sequence, and still does a lovely job
of crashing.)

Showed the bug to EC's president, he immediately wanted to try
it. It completely blew his PPC Mac (I've got a Powerbook 540C)
out of the water. (Error of type 11, dialog with only
the restart button.) My powerbook hangs on for a bit and then
locks up.

Onward to the exploit!
