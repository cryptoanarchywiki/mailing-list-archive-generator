Hmm....  notice the use of a non public cipher as the base cipher.... 
what a shame.... 

A note for non-USA people, the next version of SSLeay will include the 
full fuctionality of RSAref/RSAeuro and I should soon have the PKCS-7 
stuff finished in the next release after that.  I've almost finished the 
documentation of the encryption/RSA type routines. The encryption/open/seal 
routines supporting any cipher that conforms with a specified Cipher API.

It will be shipping with examples of des-ecb, des-cfb, des-cbc, des-ede2, 
des-ede3, idea-ecb, idea-cfb, idea-cbc and rc4-128.  If people could send 
me the official Object identifiers for these ciphers, I'll be able to 
support them in PKCS-7, otherwise they will only be supported in PEM mode.
eg,
rc4 is '1 2 840 113549 3 4'
but I don't even know what des in cbc mode is.  I lack documentation.
If any-one can email SMIME/PKCS-7 stuff that is encrypted/sealed, I'll be 
able to extract the object identifiers.

Again, SSLeay has no restrictions, 4096 bits anyone :-)
