There is also the difference between the business intelligence and business
espionage !

The business intelligence is used to collect, evaluate, analyze etc. the
business information and data that may include competitors, markets,
economic trends, suppliers among others. The sources of this information are
publicly and legally available for all companies and individuals. The formal
or informal business intelligence system can be used. The successful use of
the traditional business intelligence will result in the best results, when
this information and data is eveluated, analyzed and disseminated in the
most intelligent, reliable, timely and accurate manner. 100% of companies
are already using the business intelligence (all companies are just not
calling it the BI): some more successfully than others. The business
intelligence can be used both for strategic and tactical purposes.

                                                        Mark
