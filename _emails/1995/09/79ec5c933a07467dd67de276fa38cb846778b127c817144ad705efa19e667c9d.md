In case it was not clear: my earlier post really was not a lawsuit 
threat. It seems it was (mis)interpreted this way by some people.

Also, the original author did not post the article but someone he 
sent it to. I'm sure the author did not intend to post the text as is 
but first give us a fair chance of defending ourselves.
