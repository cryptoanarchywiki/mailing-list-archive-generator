There is this widespread and wholely misplaced affection for
"cypherpunks". We aren't a company or an organization. This is a
mailing list, and occassionally a seminar series in places like
NoCal. It isn't a "group".
..............................................

And you of all the cpunks, Perry, are the most affectionately considered. :>)

Actually, those who want to become official spokewheels should consider that 
the cypherpunk agenda is to promote anarchic (i.e. individualistic, 
self-responsible) action.  That is, that the individual who chooses to act in a 
'cypherpunkish' mode does so at their own risk by their own motivation by their 
own decision and their own discretion.  Not everyone on the list subscribes to 
this ideal of complete independence; furthermore, for anarchist types to 
identify with a "group" would be inconsistent with the philosophical attitude 
of the "members", who come-&-go as they please.

However, it would be an amazing event to see VZ Nuri-logical (Cypherpunk 
Extraordinaire) on TV, saying something like, "Yes, I fully and completely 
subscribe to the Cypherpunk agenda:  black markets, anarchy, overthrow of 
governments.  National borders are just speed bumps on the information 
superhighway."
