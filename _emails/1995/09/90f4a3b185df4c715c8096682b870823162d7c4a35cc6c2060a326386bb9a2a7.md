I'm not sure that the NSA actually would want machines on that scale
these days. Its probably a lot more economical to throw your money
into lots of much smaller machines and occassionally link them up via
networks. Unlike physics simulation problems, most crypto problems
don't involve tight communication between the parallel processors, so
the extra expense that the high speed buses represent would end up
being a waste.
