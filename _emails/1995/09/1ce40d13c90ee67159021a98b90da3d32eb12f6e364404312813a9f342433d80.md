I have been getting a load of duplicate mail from this group; not all 
messages are duplicated, only those cc'd to mail.cypherpunks as well as 
sent to the toad.com address.

I don't know if this is a gateway to a local newsgroup or what, but I 
wish the duplication would stop.  Thank you.

For pure RC4, Yes.  However, SSL is not pure RC4.

You are the third person I've heard think of this.
[ The first did quite a lot of calculations before spotting the problem ! ]

Well, the original suggestion I heard was to try 64K at a time :-))
