Jeff--

First of all, let me commend you for your honesty and forthrightness
in owning up to the problem. I applaud it both as a cypherpunk and as
one of the guys at Intergraph who pushed really hard to get an OEM
agreement with NCC.

The Mac tick unit is 1/60th of a second, and TickCount() returns the
number of ticks since the system was booted. I think you could safely
narrow the range down to between 0 and (3600 * 24 * 60 =) 5,184,000,
or about 24 bits. That's better than on the Unix boxes, but not
insurmountable.

I wouldn't consider the network to be suitably random. How many of
your users are using Netscape over high-latency, low-speed 14.4
PPP/SLIP links? A lot, I'd bet. Not much good-quality randomness
there.

Unrealistic to expect, yes. Unreasonable to ask? Maybe not.

That's probably not the most likely thing-- but why not allow people
with some security & crypto background _from this list_ see the code,
under NDA, for review? Jim Gillogly, Hal Finney, and several others
have show a past talent for that sort of thing.

Frankly, a signed message from, say, Hal saying "I've looked over the
code and it looks pretty good" would carry a lot of water with me. In
turn, I could communicate my warm fuzzy feeling to the dozen or so
people that asked me about the security flaw yesterday, including our
network ops guy.

Cheers,
- -Paul
