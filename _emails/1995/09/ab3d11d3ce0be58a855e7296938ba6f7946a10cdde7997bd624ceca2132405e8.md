	And here, I must object (sorry Perry; I'll be brief).

	Whatever do the workings of an hypothetical "libertarian"
society have to do with the "Libertarian Party"?  Certainly, it would
be nice if the latter were working towards the former, but the two are
not the same.

	I know of quite a few `l'ibertarians who strongly object to
the `L'ibertarian Party pledge.
