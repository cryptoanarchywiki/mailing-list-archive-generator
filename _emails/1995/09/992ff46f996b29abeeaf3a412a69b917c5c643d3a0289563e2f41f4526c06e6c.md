Most common mis-understanding about the GPL.  If you GPL
something, *you* hold the copyright to the material, and
can still do anything you want with it.  See Perl for a good
example - released under an artistic license and under GPL.

GPL prevents *others* from making distributions without
distributing the source code.

Of course, if you accept GPL'ed patches to your code, the
whole thing gets messy, as now you can't claim complete
ownership of the entire code base.

I have simplified this - go to gnu.misc.discuss for a complete
rehash of this subject every 2-3 weeks.
