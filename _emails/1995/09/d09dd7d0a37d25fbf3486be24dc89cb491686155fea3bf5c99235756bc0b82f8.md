A few commnets from Tim Hudson who has put SSL into telnet and ftp, he is 
not on this list but since he is my personal 'put SSL into applications' 
person (I just write the library :-), I felt his comments would be better 
than mine :-)

I agree with this statement - application of SSL at the TCP level for all
communication is possible but *not* desirable in the general case - i.e.
for internet communication.

A much better approach (and the one that I have taken for adding SSL into
TELNET and FTP) is to use *existing* negotiation mechanisms for dynamically
switching on SSL for a given link based on determining dynamically if
the server you are connecting to will support it.

Naturally you want options at both the server and the client that enable
you to:
    - fall back to "normal/insecure" mode if SSL is not available
    - drop the connection in the client if SSL is not negotiated
    - drop the connection in the server if SSL is not negotiated

My aim was when adding SSL (in the form of SSLeay) into an existing server
was *always* to be able to run the *one* server for both the "old" and 
the "new" protocol. I really was getting annoyed at seeing announcements
of yet-another-security package that could be installed that provided 
another potentially insecure access path into the system that only supported
connecting to it with it's own fixed protocol.

SSL can be seen in it simpliest form as just a nice mechanism for 
dynamically negotiating a *cipher* - this is how I initially set things
up so that the "normal" authentication mechanisms had to still be used
for connection - i.e. SSLtelnet still required the normal account password
to get access. This has since been "enhanced" so that you can switch on
an option that uses a certificate exchange as the security 
access mechanism (this is not switched on by default).

For TELNET the "best" place to start seemed to be the work done with
SRATELNET ... it already had all the hooks in the right places for 
using the RFC-defined TELNET extensions that enabled negotiation of 
authentication and encryption. (the documentation that came with SRAtelnet
was also nice and clear too).

For FTP there was a similar was of doing things so I used it too ... and
FTP is a *great* example of a protocol where doing things at the TCP
level (tranparently) would be "bad" - it used two ports ... one of which is
usually dynamically allocated ... and you certainly don't want to 
redo the initial SSL negotiation for each file that you transfer!
(SSLftp reuses the session ID).

Another thing that is worth noting (and worth looking at too) is the
different API offered in SSLREF and SSLeay (... naturally I prefer SSLeay
as I have influence over the author ;-) ... From what I know of the SSLREF
API, it takes the approach of providing wrapper functions that you use
*instead* of the "normal"  functions ... there is (not using the right
names) SSLaccept and SSLconnect that you use that perform the accept() and
connect() along with all the other things required in the SSL protocol
being hidden which sounds nice until you want to do something like FTP ...
where the connection for the DATA socket is formed in the opposite
direction to the CONTROL socket - with SSLeay you do the accept() and
connect() yourself ... as per normal and then run SSL_accept() or
SSL_connect() which does the "logical" SSL stuff ... so in FTP I can do a
connect() and then an SSL_accept() which looks funny but is the "right"
thing to do.  SSLeay has only 2 function calls that operate on socket 
file descriptors, a singe read() and a single write().  The most recent 
version will handle non-blocking IO if the application passes a file 
desciptor with it turned on.  SSLeay does not do a single 
setsockopt(), ioctl(), fcntl(), accept(), bind(), select() etc. 

If you haven't looked at SSLeay or looked and the SSL protocol itself then
you really should grab it and have a read (while ignoring the politics   
and the WWW hype over SSL).

While there are problems with certificate distribution, this will be 
overcome.  Ever tried general inter-realm authentication with Kerberos?

Both SSLref and SSLeay interoperate.  From what I know of the SSLref API, 
our API's are quite different.  Just because SSLref may 'force' you 
towards a particular style of SSL use does not mean the protocol forces 
you to use it this way.
