The problem with a statistic is that it assumes an independent variable.  If 
the variable is not truely independent (which happens with some frequency in 
real world analysis), any purported statistical result is meaningless 
(undefined, to be more precise).  Clearly, the hack of netscape relied on 
the fact that the vairable was not independent.

This is almost right.  Statistical tests work fine if they are conducted on 
independent variables.
