On Sep 22,  6:26, Dave Del Torto sent the following to the NSA's mail
archives:

I like this idea, too, except that it presupposes that the journalists who
want to contact cypherpunks have access to email.  Although that's a common
thing, it's not uniformly available yet.  Still, it's a useful service for
those journalists who do have access to email.  Perhaps both could be done,
with the people on the mailing list also available via conventional means
for the less techno-savvy journalists.
