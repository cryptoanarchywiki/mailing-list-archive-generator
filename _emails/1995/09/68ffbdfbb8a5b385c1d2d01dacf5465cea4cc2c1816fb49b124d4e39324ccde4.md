Another even more subtle problem is inline images, can you say that a
page with an inline image sourced from a foreign site must obey the
foreign jurisdiction.  I would assert this is so, because the web
surfer's *browser* imports the relevant parts of the page from
whatever locations (and jurisdictions) they are in, and displays them
as one page.

Take a look at:

	http://www.obscura.com/~shirt/

which is the www space Lance kindly donated for the UK munitions-T.
The relevance to this discussion is that www.obscura.com is of course
in the US, whilst the inline graphic is in the UK for ITAR reasons,
the is of:


#!/bin/perl -s-- -export-a-crypto-system-sig -RSA-3-lines-PERL
$m=unpack(H.$w,$m."\0"x$w),$_=`echo "16do$w 2+4Oi0$d*-^1[d2%Sa
2/d0<X+d*La1=z\U$n%0]SX$k"[$m*]\EszlXx++p|dc`,s/^.|\W//g,print
pack('H*',$_)while read(STDIN,$m,($w=2*$d-1+length($n)&~1)/2)


ie the html looks like:

	<img src="http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/obscura/rsa.gif">

So that the image is *imported* by the *viewer*, and not supplied by
www.obscura.  This means that people outside the US can also view the
page with out anyone breaking any laws, even though it appears to
contain (allegedly) ITAR contravening material.

Same would apply quite nicely to porn from the netherlands etc.

[as an aside, any one got info on how you go about converting gifs to
transparent gifs - I want the above to be transparent so that it still
works on other than a black background in case other people use it on
other backgrounds]
