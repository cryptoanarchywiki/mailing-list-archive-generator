  I'd rather think of it as a "kitchen sink" approach :-). We are looking
for bits wherever we can find them.  We are not experts in the internals
of all of our supported systems, so any suggestions people could provide
for more high quality sources on specific systems would be appreciated.

  I'd like to add that management has been very supportive of this
idea.  Barksdale was in the cellular industry when their security
through obscurity measures failed, so he knew exactly what we
were talking about.

  We have had code reviews.  We will be fixing several of this sort
of bug in the upcoming patch.
