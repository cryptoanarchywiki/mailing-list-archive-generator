According to an article in Sunday's _Washington Post_ the final draft of
the "Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure"
report is going to be released Tuesday morning.  You may recall the
premilinary draft of this report, a.k.a. the "Green Paper", and its
proposed changes to U.S. Copyright Law.  

Does anyone on the list have a copy of the final draft/"White Paper"?
The administration is evidently keeping it under pretty tight wraps,
probably because of the intense criticism the Green Paper received.
Personally, I expect the White Paper to be just as bad.
