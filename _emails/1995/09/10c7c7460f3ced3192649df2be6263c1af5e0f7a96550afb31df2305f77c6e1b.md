An:

You flamed me several months ago, essentially for being a govt flunky in 
the boonies.  You didn't respond to my last post on the topic ...

Many of us (apparently) have trouble with flames orginating from "the 
great and powerful Oz" who may be, in fact, a nonacheiver hiding behind a 
curtain.  I guess we need Toto to pull away your curtain of privacy!

If you don't diverse viewpoints, either persuade this list's owner to 
change his charter or start your own list.  Then maybe *I'll* start 
posting anonymously.

You also misread the purpose of my post re MKE.  The purpose was for me 
to get a sense whether some number of Cypherpunks might agree to some 
form of MKE (i.e. would some kind of protection that the government might 
accept, also be acceptable to most/some on the list).  I received a 
number of thoughtful and thought provoking replies.  I was expecting your 
flame, but I see you decided to use your blunderbus rater than a rifle.

And you are, of course, correct.  Make no attempt to understand your 
enemy.  Stand your ground regardless.  No tactical retreats, no overall 
strategy.

Was this from Sun Tzu?

Not a lawyer on the Net, although I play one in real life.
