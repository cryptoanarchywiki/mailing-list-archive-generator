Looking at the source code showes that all that is needed to
pass the PGP key check is for the first two blocks to decode
in such a way that the last 2 bytes of the IV match the 2
check bytes before the actual message. Thus the first 6 bytes
of the IV and the last 6 bytes of the next block need not
match the actual message.

There was a bug in the older versions of PGP that set the
IV to a constant instead of a random value when encrypting
with the "-c" option.

I made a mistake thinking that knowledge of the correct
key would help in creating a fake key.
