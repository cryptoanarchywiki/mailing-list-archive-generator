Absolutely, just as there is an assumption that private email will not be 
distributed over USEnet.

There is a clear expectation of privacy. Just as the user of a USEnet server has 
an expectation of privacy. The question of what is legitimate to use log file 
data for is a very keenly debated one at W3 conferences.
