The cold war isn't so decisive. Much of espionage has always been industrial. I
is an essential component of political espionage in any case. Millitary espiong
may get the headlines but the bulk of the work is trawling through trade stats 
and various open networks in embassies etc.

In any case with the breakup of the USSR there are now more states to watch and
because they are unstable more need to watch them.
