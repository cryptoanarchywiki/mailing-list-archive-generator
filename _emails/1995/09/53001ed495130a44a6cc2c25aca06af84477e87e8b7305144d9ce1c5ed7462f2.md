I wondered the same thing myself.  It would certainly be a more
cost-effective way for the NSA to compromise Mixmaster technology
than by brute force.

Consider this scenario ...  Mixmaster get's bought by the Acme
Crypto Company of Ft. Meade, MD.  They "improve" it, and offer a new
version.  It's even FREE (for non-commerical use)!  But their
"improvements" make it incompatible with previous versions, and so
you have to upgrade.  The new "commercial" version comes with no
SOURCE CODE, of course...
