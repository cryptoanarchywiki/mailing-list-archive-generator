Ok folks, I recently received "Applied Cryptography" as a gift, and just 
have one question: How does the MOD function work in crypto functions? It 
seems to work differently than what I've seen before, i.e.: C/C++ MOD. I 
also didn't see anything in TCM's FAQ...

If this is considered noise, I apologize in advance.
