> The machine, to be built at an estimated cost of $45

> microprocessors linked in a configuration known as

> traditional supercomputers like those made famous by Cray
> Research Inc., which use far fewer, but far more powerful
> processors.

> Intel said its new supercomputer would be the first to
> achieve the goal of calculating more than a trillion
> floating-point operations a second, known as a teraflop.
> The machine, to be kept at Sandia National Laboratories
> In Albuquerque, N.M., would be used by Department of
> Energy scientists to study a variety of complex problems,
> foremost among them nuclear weapons safety.
