While I'm at it, here's a question I've been wondering about recently: Why
is it I've never heard of any security issues with Lotus Notes?  Are there
no known weaknesses?  Or did existing weaknesses just not get much press
because Notes isn't a commercially visible consumer product like Netscape?
