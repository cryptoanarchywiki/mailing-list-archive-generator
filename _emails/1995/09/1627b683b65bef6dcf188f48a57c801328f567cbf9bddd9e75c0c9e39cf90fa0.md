A good point that deserves further comment. Employers have taken to _saying
nothing_ about past employees, for fear of lawsuits by disgruntled job
seekers. So much for free speech, courtesy of the American legal system.

But as we can't changed the litigious nature of American society (and maybe
European society--I don't know), the emphasis ought to be on digital
systems and reputations by pseudonyms.

Hal's comment about transferring credentials is one approach. Sort of an
automated version of "Pr0duct Cypher says the work of Sue D'Nim is good."

At this point, not enough pseudonymns to make it very worthwhile, but someday...

Another good point. I always think: "Ah, they couldn't get either Siskel or
Ebert to endorse it." As Futplex notes, endorsements by second- or
third-tier endorsers are often a _negative_ endorsement.
