Jerod, I'm forwarding your message to a couple of lists.  I thought you
made good points.  Of course DigiCash is only running a demo, but still--
why demo poor security?  I think it doesn't make a good impression.


Bryce, signatures at end

I have a couple of problems/complaints with your ecash project.
When I was sent my Acct ID and Passwd they were sent to me plain text
instead of being PGP-encrypted first.  This means that some malicious
hacker could have intercepted the e-mail message and stolen the
free cyber-bucks you were so generous as to give me.  Second, on the
WWW-page where one downloads the software it does not seem to do a secure
connection between my browser and your server (on netscape there is
a small key in the lower-left hand corner that is supposed to show when
one is securely connected to a secure server).  So someone could sniff my
password from the transaction when I GET the software.  Also When I'm
buying/selling things it would be smart for all parties involved to
be using PGP, and I think you should stress this point more in your page.
Otherwise this is another vulnerable point in your system IMHO.
Thank you for your time.
