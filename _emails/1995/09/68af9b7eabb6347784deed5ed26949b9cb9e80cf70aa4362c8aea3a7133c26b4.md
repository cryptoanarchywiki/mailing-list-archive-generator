Here's another option.  I just have no idea if it is possible, nor how it
would be implemented!  PGP could allow for an alternate secret key and a
boilerplate document.  This document would be "overlaid" or appended to
the target file at encryption.  When the safety is finally removed from
the gun at your head (sorry for the drama) you hand over your alternate
secret key.  The encrypted file is wiped until it reaches a marker; the
remainder of the file is displayed.  If you are forced to turn over keys
some day (and I think there is at least a reasonable likeihood of that) 
then They will have a much harder time arguing "But that's not what the 
file *really* said and, deep inside of me, I know it!".  At that point, 
with a secure wipe going on while the "decryption" was taking place, you 
have done the best you could.  I agree- a search warrent gives 
authorities the right to search your home (or disk)- not a guarantee that 
they'll find what they're looking for.
