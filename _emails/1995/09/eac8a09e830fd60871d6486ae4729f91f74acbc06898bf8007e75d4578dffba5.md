This is the problem I was concerned about (actually RSA rather than D-H). 
In HTTP-NG, in addition to supporting PK for key exchanges and 
authentications, there is now support that allows most values used in the 
protocol to be signed. Now that non repudiability is becoming legally 
significant, there are all sort of things that either party might want to 
have signed, for example negotiation options (e.g. wont-log-transactions) 
and meta-information (e.g. kidcode: NC-17,barney-boffing).

More clients and more signings means that conventional chips arent't 
going to be economical for this.

That's another question. A DSP chip can also be used for crypto - yet 
sound cards and nexts aren't ITARed, and aren't really considered 
dual-use. A Modular exponentiator isn't a crypto device  (hey - 
it's a bignum accelerator for Mathematica). Now, if I had a pipelined 
WSI chip capable of delivering one result per cycle, I could think of 
some useful applications, but ...
