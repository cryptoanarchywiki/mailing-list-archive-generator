I'm interested in setting up a key-signing in the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale
area on 28 or 29 October.

Location is flexible, but the date isn't very - a friend of mine is going
to be in town from Down Under from some time on the 27th to the morning
of the 31st and he'd like to snag as many signatures on his key as possible.

"The subjection to which the American citizen is now exposed every day
of his life is so great that the whole idea of liberty ("That which
does not injure one's neighbor") is almost totally lost. The greatest
of despots, Louis XIV, never told his subjects what they could or
could not eat and drink, and he never told them how to conduct their
private lives."
