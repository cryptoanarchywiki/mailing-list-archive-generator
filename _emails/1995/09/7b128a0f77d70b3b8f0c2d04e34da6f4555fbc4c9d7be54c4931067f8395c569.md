The encrypted filesystem I promised never came through, partly because I've
been busy but also because I'm toying with writing it for OS/2 instead... 
alas I know little about OS/2.

Either way, the encryption/decryption routines are nicely written, and I am
willing to make them available for perusal either way (their written in 386
Assembler code).

Drop me a note if you're interested.
