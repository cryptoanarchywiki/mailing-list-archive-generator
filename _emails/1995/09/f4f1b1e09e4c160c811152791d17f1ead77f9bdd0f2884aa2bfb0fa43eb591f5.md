  As far as I know the NSA did not tell Netscape anything about this
RNG vulnerability.  If they had we would have fixed it immediately and
put up a patch.  Believe it or not we don't like being trashed for
being stupid all over the net, print media, and TV.  As far as I know
the NSA have not given us any advice about how to make our system
stronger.  I've heard rumors that they were quite upset when they
learned that SSLs 40-bit RC4 was actually 40-bit secret and 88-bit salt.
