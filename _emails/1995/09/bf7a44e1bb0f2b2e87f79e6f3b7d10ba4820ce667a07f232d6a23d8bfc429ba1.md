Has anyone already created the necessary patches for Apache
<http://www.apache.org/>, or does anyone know whether the Apache dev
team would be amenable to including conditional directives to allow the
build of a secure version? If anyone is thinking of making the effort
to create a publicly available secure server, Apache's probably the
best source base to work with.
