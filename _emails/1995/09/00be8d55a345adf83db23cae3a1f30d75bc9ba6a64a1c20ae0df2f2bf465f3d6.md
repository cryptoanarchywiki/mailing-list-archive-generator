| Has anyone seen any media coverage of last week's meetings?
| I haven't seen anything in either the Washington Post or
| the Wall Street Journal. Nothing on radio or local TV either.
| 
| I don't expect much coverage, as Joe Sixpack has no knowledge of
| why he should be interested. But I expected at least a paragraph
| hidden somewhere inside.  Perhaps I missed it.
| 
| Anyone else seen any???

I'm just in the process of sending off the abstract you did plus
the pointers to a number of journalist I know. But thats in Sweden,
so I guess it doesn't count. :-)
