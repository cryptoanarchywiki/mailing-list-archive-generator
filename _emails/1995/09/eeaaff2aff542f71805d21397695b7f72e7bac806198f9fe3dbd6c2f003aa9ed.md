I've read a good chunks of FR's work at
http://www.ai.mit.edu/misc/unabomber and have to say he is making some very
interesting and incisive arguments, not all of which I disagree with.

But I also searched the text for mention of "crypto" and only came up with
the fairly standard usage of "crypto leftist." My assumption then is that
the meme of crypto anarchy has spread to the writer at that UK newspaper (I
wonder if Brian Arthur has been talking to them?) and that he interpret's
FR's screed in terms of crypto anarchy?

Still, his writing style and some of his points seem close enough to some
of my own points, not to mention his Northern California nexus and
estimated age, that I'm expecting more inquiries (I deflected one already).

After the call from the Sheriff's office about my alleged activities, I
wonder....
