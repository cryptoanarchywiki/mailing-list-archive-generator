  The issue is that any statement that only mentions the 1 minute figure
is only stating part of the story, just as a statement giving a figure
of several hours is only mentioning a part of the story.  All of the
news articles I've seen (not an exhaustive sample) have only mentioned
the 1 minute number, which only really effects a relatively small
number of our customers.

  If you don't know the pid and ppid, or the tick count in the case of
Mac/PC, you will have to add them to your search, which could make it
take much longer than 1 minute to crack.  If you assume that the unix
machine has been up for a while and has a decent turnover of processes
(not a valid assumption for determining strength) then you would have
to search on average half of 16 bit pid space, and then add a few bits
for the ppid(assuming that it is likely to be close to the pid).

  Even if you only got 8 extra bits from pid and ppid, that turns your
one minute attack into a several hour attack. 

  Anyway, I'm not trying to say that "several hours" is the only answer,
just that it is just as good an answer as "one minute".  As far as I
know, no one has tried this attack without knowing the pids.

  This is really dependent on how long window has been running.  If you
boot windows and immediately start an ssl connection, then the number
will be pretty low, but if you don't make the first SSL connection until
later, it should get better.  I think an hour would get you around 16-bits,
but this is just a guestimate on my part.  If you leave your machine
running windows for days you will get close to 32bits.

  We had a conference call with RSA folks tuesday, and they will be in
wednesday to take a look at our fix.
