As a follow-up to the article reference I posted, I pose the
following question:

Will cryptographic technology and information (communication)
technology reduce the need for legal services in the future?
(especially regarding contracts, buying/selling, patent law, etc.)
Will legal services just look different?  Will they be more
efficient (cheaper)?

Put bluntly, will cryptography put lawyers out of business?

Any comments would be appreciated.

Cort.
