The good news is xs4all were prepared for them and have mounted a publicity
campaign against co$. co$ has withdrawn their complaint (though xs4all have
not be _officially notified yet) in an attempt to patch up things but it's
too late for co$ to save them from the wrath.

xs4all has a lot of support in all facets of .nl life so co$ is going to have
a bad time screwing with them. From what I learnt there will be a lot of noise
RSN in the press.

My personal view is co$ deserves all the flak they get.

The above opinions are rumoured to be mine.
