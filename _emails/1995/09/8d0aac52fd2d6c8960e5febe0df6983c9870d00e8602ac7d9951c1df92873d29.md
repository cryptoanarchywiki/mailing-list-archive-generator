If you get a copy of the latest Private Idaho beta, it's got a convenient set
of user interfaces for using the nymservers, as well as for PGP, remailers, etc.
(Runs on Windows, so some of you may not find it all _that_ convenient :-)
PI works with either vanilla PGP or ViaCrypt.
The first step is to get the PGP key for alias@alpha.c2.org installed in your
key ring, and update PI's key tables (a menu item).  Then choose the "Create
a nym"
menu item and follow all the dialog boxes.  I found it a little confusing at
first,
since I didn't realize the nymserver just uses secret-key encryption and not 
public-key, so you don't need to create a public-key-pair to do it - the only
PGP involved is encrypting the message sent to the nymserver.

So you can now send mail to the _highly_ anonymous wcs@alpha.c2.org :-)
