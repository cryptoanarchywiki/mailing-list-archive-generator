A very interesting project!  Can you give us some data like how many is the
maximum number of hops necessary to connect two people on the WoT?  (I am
aware that one wouldn't want to trust such a connection, and that PGP doesn't
actually allow you to do so for hops > 2...)


(P.S.  I guess "12" based on the number of passes necessary.  That seems like
a really high number to me...)


Are any obvious pseudonyms in?  (I would guess not.)


I wonder what sorts of statistical analyses could be done on this WoT?  Is it
fairly evenly spread out or are the noticeably larger "clumps" of mutual
signatures?  How many keys *are* there in this (subset of the) WoT?


Here's a question:  for two randomly selected members of your WoT, how many
signatures would a Man In The Middle have to fake in order to isolate the one
member from the other?


Thanks for this, Don.
