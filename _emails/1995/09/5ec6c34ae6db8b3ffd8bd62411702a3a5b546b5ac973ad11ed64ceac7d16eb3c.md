  My view of SSL is that it should not generally be considered a transparent
layer that can be plugged in below any application.  I don't consider
HTTP on top of SSL to be the same as HTTP, or something that can totally
replace HTTP.  Thats why we use a different port and call it https: and not
http. I think using TELNET and FTP as examples of protocols that can be
transparently layered on top of SSL was unfortunate.  I've looked at
what it takes to make some existing protocols work with SSL, and I'm not
convinced that its always appropriate.  For example FTP and RCMD use
multiple connections, which is a royal pain.

  It seems that the thing you are objecting to is the wording in the
spec, in the "motivation" section, that appears to suggest that the
entire internet could run on top of SSL.  I think that section of the
spec could just be chopped out, and SSL would still be useful today
without pretentions of world domination.

  If a secure IP standard emerges that is widely deployed and provides
similar services, I don't see why SSL couldn't just go away (this is my
opinion, not an official position of netscape).

  This was sort of off the top of my head.  I've not spent long hours
contemplating these questions...
