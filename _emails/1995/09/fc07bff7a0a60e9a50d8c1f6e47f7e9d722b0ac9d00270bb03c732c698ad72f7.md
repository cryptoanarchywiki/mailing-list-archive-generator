Perry's response and Brian Davis' remarks about prosecutorial "creativity"
prompted me to ask Phil Dubois for clarification.  (I told him I would
probably pass his reply along to the list, so I'm not violating email
confidentiality here.)  Here's the relevant snippet:

========================================================================

I believe that the statute expires in June of '96, because there is a
five-year statute on the export-violation allegation and because PGP was
released in June of '91, and whoever exported it did so shortly after the
release.  It is true, however, that prosecutors have been very creative in
extending the statute when they've felt the need to do so.  We can only
hope that DOJ will not feel the need in this case.

========================================================================

I also feel Phil will be largely off the hook by June.  It would be
damn silly to prolong the matter, especially since the complete source
code has been published internationally in OCR format now.  Also, I
expect the Feds would rather focus their "creative" energies on the
Bernstein/EFF export issue.

But who knows what anti-crime hysteria might be whipped up in an
election year, or who it might become handy to demonize, etc.
