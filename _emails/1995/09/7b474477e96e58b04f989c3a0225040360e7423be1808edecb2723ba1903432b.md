Hurricane Luis took Anguilla apart.  The three utility polls right near my
house all blew down.  My house, computers, etc are all fine.

Nobody was killed in Anguilla, but in St Marten (5 miles away) it seems
there were many people killed.  They have a lot of poor people there
and also a lot of people used to live in boats.  More than 1,000 of
about  1,400 boats sank.

They eye went right over Anguilla.  For awhile it was calm enough that
everyone went outside to stretch and say hi to everyone.  Overall it
took about 4 days to pass.

It has been nice to have solar pannels, batteries, an interter, etc. I did
not have a cellphone, but I do now.

And now that I have one I am really interested in the directional antenna
that might let me reach other islands - in particular the US Virgin
islands where long distance rates are $0.10/min at night with sprint
instead of the $2/min that we pay here in Anguilla.  Does anyone know
where I can order a directional cellphone antenna (boat antenna) good for
100 miles?
