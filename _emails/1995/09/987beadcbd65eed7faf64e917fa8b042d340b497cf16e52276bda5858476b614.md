Everything you need to know put pressure on Congress critters is at
http://www.NRA.org/pub/congress/104/
I especially recommend http://www.NRA.org/pub/congress/104/congress.awk.Z
- From the readme: "congress.awk is a comma-seperated database of congress
members & some unix awk code for manipulating the database"
