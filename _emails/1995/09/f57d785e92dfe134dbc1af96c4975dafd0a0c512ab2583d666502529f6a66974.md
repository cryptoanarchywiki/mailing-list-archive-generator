Sure disclosure is required.  There is no requirement; however, that an 
invention be your _whole_ product.  For example, most automobiles have 
thousands of patents involved in their creation.  It is entirely possible, 
even commonplace, as I said in my mail, that one or more portions of a 
product represent practice of patented inventions, and one or more _other_ 
portions represent trade secrets.

That depends.  Obviously, trade secret protection can be very effective for 
processes involved in manufacturing physical goods.  In software, it depends 
on whether what you are treating as a secret becomes widely known (after 
which, self-evidently, it is no longer a secret!)  For example, if one where 
to keep the mathematics behind MD5 a trade secret, it is plausible that it 
would never be "figured out" just from examining object code that implements 
the algorithm.  It doesn't matter if it theoretically could be done, just 
that it hasn't actually happened.
