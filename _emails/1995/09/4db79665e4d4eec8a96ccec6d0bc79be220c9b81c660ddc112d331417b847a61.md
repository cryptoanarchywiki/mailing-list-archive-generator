Inline images are not references -- they are part of the page being
retrieved.

Inlined images are just a convenient way of chunking.  The image is imported
by the viewer because the server, as part of the base document, told it
to do so.  You might be able to fool an ignorant court, but it still
doesn't change the fact that Lance has a document that in the natural
course of operation of the Web, exports crypto.  I would advise him to
edit the page so it reads
	Click <A HREF="http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/~aba/obscura/rsa.gif">here
	to see a picture of the shirt.

Heck, the very word, "inline" gives it away.
