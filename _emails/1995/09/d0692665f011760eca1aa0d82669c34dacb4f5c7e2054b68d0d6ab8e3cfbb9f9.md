Today at the Sun JAVA presenation in NYC.. Sun staff member
Hal Stern who was talking about security mentioned Cypherpunks..
when talking about Thomas Jefferson saying roughly that Jefferson
would be one if he was a live.

He might read this list (Hi Hal!).

Anyway he gave a good talk on securty and actually seemed to
be aware of many of the issues.
