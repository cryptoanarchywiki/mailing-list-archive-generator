Instead of stripping, how about adding an offset to the start and end of
the ciphertext to each encoded idea key.  This way, I can send text A to
key A, text B to key B, C to C and so on.  As long as the recipient and
I have agreed in advance on which key to use to exchange the real message,
who can say otherwise?  If code words are used in all the messages to
refer to any illegal acts, ("ship me 30 kilos of smack" might be a tad
incriminating) how can anything be proved even if the recipient is
compelled to divulge their key?

An added advantage to this scheme is that if properly used it should help
throw a monkey wrench into traffic analysis by the nosy.  If I regularly
exchange encrypted messages with several different recipients, I can
enclose a seperate plaintext for each, make one massive combined
cyphertext and send it to all of them.  The ones I have no instructions
or trade secrets for today will each receive "Ignore this message,"
followed by a randomly selected random number of fortunes or other random
data (so each message to be ignored will have different length different
plaintext to further thwart analysis).

This may be combined with stealth PGP headers to make it difficult for
LEAs to determine all recipients for the purpose of getting a subpeona
for their keys.
