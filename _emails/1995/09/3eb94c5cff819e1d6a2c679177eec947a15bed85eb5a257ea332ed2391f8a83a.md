To add two bignums, P(x) and Q(x) simply sum coefficients of like
terms like you would with any polynomial addition, with one simple
modification. If a_k is the coefficient of the x^k term of P(x), and

etc, etc.


Just a quick clarification, people:

In the UK, and, presumably Australia, "doing sums" refers to performing any
kind of arithmetic, not just addition.


And to Sherry Mayo:

Don't give up on the code, just yet.  Try running it and watching it with a
debugger.
