Even in a cryptoanarchy I would want to treat customers kindly and I would
want to make sure that in any agreement that both parties are clear as to
when we are complying or not.  A lawyer might help in complex cases.
Especially if UCC is referenced.

And in some kinds of escrow a "judge" might be invoked if there is a
despute.  The judge might be a lawyer or might bring in a lawyer as an
expert.

The nature of the work of a lawyer in a crytoanarchy might be very
different.  Lawyers might even become highly respected and liked!
