<URL:http://ganges.cs.tcd.ie/mepeirce/Project/Mlists/brands.html> has a
good collection of earlier discussions on Brands' cash, as well as
pointers to Brands' work itself.

Brands' home page, <URL:http://www.cwi.nl/~brands> has a long list of
advantages which his system has over Chaum's original cash proposals,
mostly technical in terms of efficiency and provability.

Brands' and Chaum's systems have similar anonymity properties so I don't
see much to choose between them on political grounds.  Brands tends to
work in the context of off-line systems with "observer" chips which
prevent double spending.  But his protocols can be used in other payment
environments as well.
