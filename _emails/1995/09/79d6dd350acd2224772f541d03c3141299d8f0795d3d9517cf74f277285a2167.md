All this paranoid talk about the dangers of thumbprints on ID cards, about
driver's licenses, and about magstripes got me to thinking.

So, I accessed my NLETS (National Law Enforcement Telecommunications
System) and downloaded my own record:

Citizen-Unit ASCII Name: "Timothy Christopher May"
NLETS Actual Name: G0Yj34C1qm92H7u
Known Aliases: "Klaus! von Future Prime," "Lance," "Nick Szabo"
Residence: 427 Allan Lane, Corralitos, CA 95075
Driver's License: N4197484
SSN: 227-80-5823
Passport Number: H673qop90
Race: Aryan
Origin: Europe
Hair: Brown
Eyes: Blue
Weight: 210 pounds (10/94, recorded at SFO)
Known associations: Anarchist Alliance, Young Students for Discordianism,
Vernor Vinge Fan Club, Information Liberation Front
Magazines Subscribed To: Newsweek, Playboy, The Economist, MacWeek, Anarchy
Today, Liberty, FertilizerWorld, Reason, MacUser, NewtonGazette, Bay Aryan
Events, Information Week
Consumer Preferences: beer (+++), wine (+), cigarettes (-)
Electricity Patterns: consistent with either marijuana cultivation or heavy
Net usage, or both
Threat level: Class 3 Security Threat

I don't see what the big deal is. The NLETS record implies I'm some kind of
security threat, but also correctly notes that I'm an Aryan, so I guess I'm
safe.
