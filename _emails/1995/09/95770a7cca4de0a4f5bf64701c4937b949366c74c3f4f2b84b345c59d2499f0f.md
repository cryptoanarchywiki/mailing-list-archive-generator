This document describes how Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) can be used to 
provide privacy and authentication using the Multipurpose Internet Mail 
Extensions (MIME) security content types described in RFCXXXX 
(draft-ietf-pem-sigenc-03.txt).                                            

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.	
	                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-elkins-pem-pgp-00.txt".
							
NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
							
For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.
							

Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
