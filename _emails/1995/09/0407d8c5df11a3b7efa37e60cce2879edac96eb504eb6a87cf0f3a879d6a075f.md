What minimal requirements would be needed to support encrypted packets/files
that a holder could only decrypt after a certain date/time?
(Time Escrow?)

Or a server that releases keys if a 'heartbeat' isn't or a trigger is received?
(Escrow in the banking/legal sense.)
(Video/sound recordings for security, opened at court's request., Ecash
Escrow, missing persons)

The obvious is a server that releases keys periodically (and serves old keys
at will).

Is there any way to make this trustable?

Multiple servers with shared (xor split, etc.) keys of some kind?


Design ideas?


Applications: 

Gov. docs with expiration dates for privacy/secrecy.

Source code for projects (if a company folds, copyright expires, etc.).

Contract release to companies, public, etc.
(15 minute stock data, agreements for commercial use initially,
 public/fair use later)
