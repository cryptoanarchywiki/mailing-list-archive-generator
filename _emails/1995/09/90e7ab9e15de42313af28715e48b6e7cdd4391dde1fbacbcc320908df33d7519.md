Speaking for myself only, of course, mandatory key escrow under *any*
circumstances is a Bad Thing.  I don't want anyone to have my secret
key/passphrase, even if 'anyone' consists of n respected cypherpunks.
(How are we supposed to tell whether they're LE, anyway?  I possess
a high degree of confidence, for example, that Tim May is not an
undercover spook.  But that doesn't stop various tentacles^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H
anonymous posters from expressing assertions to the contrary.)

If I *give* my key to an escrow agent, of course, that's a different
story.  ("Mr. Cheatem, in the event of my death or disappearance, please
decrypt this file with the enclosed key and fax it to the Washington
Post.")  But I certainly don't want to allow my key to reside with an
agent who could be forced to turn it over on the basis of a court order.

Sorry if I'm repeating an earlier discussion.

Mark
