This area of court ordered key disclosure is troubling.

I assume that failure to do so would be punished by
"contempt of court" much like a reporter that refuses
to reveal his information sources. (Jail or Fine until
the person complies with the order).

If you have PGP encrypted messages on your disk which
are encrypted to other people.  Is this a libality ?

Normally, you have no way to decrypt this data.

After looking at a PGP 'Hack' which allows the message
to be encrypted with a session key different from the
session key encrypted in the RSA header using someones
public key.  Your data could thus be encrypted in a PGP
message to someone without using the session key specified
in that RSA header.

This someone else may or may not exist.  You may have
created a key pair and discarded the secret key.
It would then seem that you could be found in "Contempt of
Court" because you could not come forward with a private
key belonging to someone other than yourself.
