Consenses or consensuses or consenci? Maybe consensen? Consensix?

Careful there, that comma is rather small to be between two completely
unrelated statements. You might want a semicolon, full stop or
better yet a paragraph break.

If you want another to make a round number, how about something
about GAK and a-screwed keys? I think there's a consensus on
that one... (definitely stronger than on the Netscape point, anyway)


Good luck, anyway!
