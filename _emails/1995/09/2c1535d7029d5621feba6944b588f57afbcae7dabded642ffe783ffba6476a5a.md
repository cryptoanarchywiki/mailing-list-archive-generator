	Good question, but a quick modification allows for effective
bootstrapping.  If I want to start consulting for Amalgameted
Consolodated, I can offer them a 10 free questions deal to bootstrap
things with.  Mallet can only cheat if my offer was broadcast.  (I 
presume that Amalagated' keys are somehow strongly verified, and the
negotiantions are kept secret from Eve and Mallet.)

	There might also be fingerprinting technologies that allow me
to embed a signature in the documents returned to clients that would
allow me to show that Mallet stole them.  (Which might, incidentally,
get Mallet a job in some circles...If thats known, Bob and Alice can
collude to make it appear that Bob was Mallet, and thus forge a
reputation.
