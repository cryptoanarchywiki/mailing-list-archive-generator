That's not possible. The offense in question took place on or before
September 8, 1992, and the statute of limitations is, to my knowledge,
three years. Even if it were four years, it would have to be September
8th of that year.  Branko Lankester announced availability of PGP 2.0
on Mon, 7 Sep 1992 at about 20:22 GMT, so since the allegation is that
he exported PGP Version 1.0 to the team that developed PGP 2.0
overseas, any export that Phil performed would have of necessity to
have taken place before then.

Michael, you are one of our local lawyers. Could you please confirm
the length of the statute of limitations?

Perry
