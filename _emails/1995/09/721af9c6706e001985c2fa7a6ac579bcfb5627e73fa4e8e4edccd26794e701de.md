Is _that_ what was going on with Pentium division?  
Less seriously, thoguh, a UART might be a good place to add a random
number source, since it may be able to extract randomness from communication
line jitter, is usually an easily replaceable part on most machines,
and communicates at a higher speed than you're likely to need for
most randomness applications.
