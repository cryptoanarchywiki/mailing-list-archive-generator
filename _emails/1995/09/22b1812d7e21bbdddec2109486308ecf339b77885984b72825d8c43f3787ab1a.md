Hmmmm... If memory serves, a year or so ago there was just such a schism
when a prominent cypherpunk split off and formed the "cypherWONKS" list. 
The failure of that list can be attributed to one thing and one thing
alone: a concerted effort by YOU and your acolytes against it.  You refuse
to even mention this, which is all the proof any open-minded person needs. 
Now you are trying to stifle all open debate by doing it again. So, Mr.
May/Szabo (if that IS your name), why not come clean once and for all
about your role in the deaths of Vince Foster and Randy Weaver's wife, and
your part in the newly-emerging administration scandal: TENTACLE-gate. 

						Watch the skies,
