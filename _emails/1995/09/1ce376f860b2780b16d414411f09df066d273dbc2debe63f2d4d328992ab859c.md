The same danger happens with the TIS DRC (see the company web page), even
though there is no key escrow in the TIS system.  Instead, the emergency
access field (Data Recovery Field (DRF)) is stored with the file -- but the
key which encrypts it is the public key of the Data Recovery Center (DRC).

If too much attractive stuff is available by loss of any one public key,
that key gets attacked.  To compensate for this, the TIS DRC generates new
public keys periodically to give out to new (or old) customers.

However, a government warrant which demands the DRC's private key collection
would gain quite a harvest.
