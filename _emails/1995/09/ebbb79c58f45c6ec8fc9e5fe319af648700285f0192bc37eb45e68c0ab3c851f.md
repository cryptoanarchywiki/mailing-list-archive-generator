My guess is that you're on a network with multiple AppleTalk zones.  The
"PGPfone 1.0b4 README" file mentions a known bug that causes PGPfone to
freeze when trying to bring up its AppleTalk Browser.  The Read Me file
then goes on to explain how to connect anyway.  Be sure to use a
semi-colon, not a colon, between the zone name and the macintosh name...
