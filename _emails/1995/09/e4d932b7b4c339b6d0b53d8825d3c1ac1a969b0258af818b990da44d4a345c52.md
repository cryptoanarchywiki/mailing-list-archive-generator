Hey!  I never said I could type at 1am!  Yes, I know.  #%#$#%ing spelling
flames.  Grumble. Grumble. (BTW, the compass egg will show up in any page
with /jwz/ in the url.  The "anim" tag on his page is bogus.)

The url for the spec is: http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html.

The cookie overload probibly only worked under 1.1 and before.  The spec
claims to have limits on the number of cookies you can have.  But between
this and the server API, I am sure that a hole or two has to exist.  This is
an area not explored by many.  (For good reason.  It is usually poorly
documented...)

OBParanoia:  Want something to really make you worried.  Imagine this for a
web page...  A local law enforcement agency decides that it wants to nab a
few of those "computer preverts".  They create a web site that has a cgi
script that looks for providers from a list.  It then has a link that shows
up only for people at one of those sites to "get hot porn pics".  They then
collect enough machine names and other info, then use the collected
information to obtain a warrent to seize the ISP's logs to match users with
machines. (Most browsers to not report e-mail address.) In the current
hysteria I do not see this scenerio too far off.  Makes you wonder what
constitutes entrapment anymore?
