No, the weakest link is that you have to trust the person _running_
the time key system.  Spoofing the clock only matters to a system 
you trust.  Even a system running on a satellite isn't trustable
unless you're running it yourself; your good friend and business partner
who launched it may have put in a backdoor because the KGB threatened
to kill his grandmother if he didn't.
