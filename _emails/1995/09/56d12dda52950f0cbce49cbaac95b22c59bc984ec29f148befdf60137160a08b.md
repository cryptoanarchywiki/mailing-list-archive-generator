Copious apologies if this is old news, but I just got a chance to read some
mags from the last few weeks:

An article in *The Economist* (August 5th-11th 1995 p56) reports that the
United States Postal Service has plans to offer *electronic certificates of
identity encoded to prevent forgery*
It goes on to say that they are working with the usual suspects (Microsoft
and Lotus/IBM) to get appropriate software included in their products. 

Future services include timestamping, multimedia kiosks in post office
lobbies and e-mail print out and delivery services (for the connectivity
challenged).

I guess this puts a new twist on saying that PGP is an envelope for your
e-mail.
