Problems with that:
  1. SecDev needs a way to easily ID it's own files. Encrypting a known
     ID string would be a weakness (known plaintext) so it's better to
     have a plaintext identifyer.

  2. If someone thinks it's a lost TMP file they will delete it. Not a
     risk you want.  It's better if they think it's a strange type of
     swap file or something needed by an application.

Source is available... so you can change the ID string in source to
something innocuous yet unique and recompile it.

Well, there's a risk of someone seeing a mysterious file and deleting
it anyway... assuming they don't go ballistic over it anyhow.

There's also a risk of someone peering over your shoulder and noticing
that something's afoot as well, is there not?
