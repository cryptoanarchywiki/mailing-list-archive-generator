Well, there is selective wording, mispellings, punctuation and
formatting. These can be corrected easily if allowed to be
transported as a text or common file type.

Another  way is to place the document in a PItA proprietary graphical
format for transport and viewing only, stego identifier imbedded if
you chose * , so that every portion of the document has some
indentifier imbedded in it. Many obvious and many devious. Electronic
drawings with a harmless and useless circuit(s) added on , software
with do nothing code (by design!:) ).  Difficult and time consuming
to do, but for megabuck items, no prob. Automated for an additional
fee of course. Start a service industry for such, make money, pay me
back by running a fast, reliable remailer.

Idea is to make the thief go to some major effort and if the scanning
option is used to make the deletions  as obvious and telling as the
former identifier.

note* Makes a neat way of putting copyright & source  information in picture and 
sound files, somewhat useless but every trip up helps.
