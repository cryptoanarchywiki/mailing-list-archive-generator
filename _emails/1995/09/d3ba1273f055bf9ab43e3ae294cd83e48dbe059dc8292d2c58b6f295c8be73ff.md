My favorite Clipper master key generation algorithm, in the sacrificial
laptop in the Mykotronix vault, is:

	\[ K(n) = H_1(R_1, R_2, n) = H_2( n ) \]

where $H_2$ is a damned good one-way function, as highly classified as
DERD's original description of the PRNG in the chip programming process
indicated, $n$ is the chip's serial number, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the ranno
seeds provided by NIST and Treasury folks and $K(n)$ is the master key for
chip n.
