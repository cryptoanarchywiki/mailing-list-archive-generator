Nor was I suggesting a legal solution (I know your comment
was triggered by Rob's request for legal recourse) but instead
suggesting that things are farther along than some people realize.

Someone suggested a rational, non-hysterical approach to
converting people.  Perhaps.  I certainly wrote a nice letter
to the editor of a magazine which published a piece about
electronic checking, and made sure to mention that e-cash
would be preferable to some.  

On the other hand, The Gub'mint is certainly conducting a
campaign overt and covert to throttle unlimited and uncontrolled
use of cryptography.  That combined with how politicized
things are these days, it can be difficult to conduct a rational
debate or in fact find anyone who wants to talk. 

Personally, I'm of the opinion that we need to a pre-emptive
crypto strike.  But just as the 'Privacy Card' has been debated
here endlessly, so too reaching critical market mass w/a 
'bump in the cord' product.
