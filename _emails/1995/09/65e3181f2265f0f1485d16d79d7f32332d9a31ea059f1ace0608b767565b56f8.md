Perhaps true, but this assumes that the Chaum method is the only method, 
which I believe to be incorrect.  Perhaps I should use the term "future 
e-cash models" or "True Digital Cash."

Currently there is no "true" e-cash implemented (as far as I know), but 
this is part of the problem.

The product introduced to the public, the original market release
will be (is) traceable, why should the public expect anything different?  In
addition this is exactly what I was talking about in deterring the use of
"real" e-cash.  Real e-cash will be seen as an anomoly, a perversion of e-cash 
to make it sneaky for the four horsemen (or that's how I would play it to 
the public were I a statist).

Again, one more reason that "real" e-cash will be banned.  The public 
doesn't need it as an alternative is widely available.

This is the curse (or gift) of crippleware- its use as a diversion.
