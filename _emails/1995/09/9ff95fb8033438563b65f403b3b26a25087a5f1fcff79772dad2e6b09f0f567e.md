The RSA algorithm, and thus RSA's software, uses public-key cryptography,
and is therefore within the scope of the claims of the Merkle-Hellman
and/or Hellman-Pohlig patents.  Also, the recent RSAREF versions contain
Diffie-Hellman code, which is covered by the Diffie-Hellman patents (but
PGP doesn't use that version of RSAREF.)

On the other hand, the RSAREF license says that RSA will defend any patent
claims for use of its code (I forget if that was RSADSI or RSA Labs),
and Jim Bidzos confirms that that's still the case even after the PKP breakup.
