Now that you mention it, it seems to me that completely anonymous tipsters
with the ability to receive ecash rewards would likely be a bigger boon to
law enforcement types than would easily tappable communications lines.  
Is anyone in a position to set up a cypherpunks CrimeStoppers mailbox (for
use through the remailers)?  You could set up a web-page with instructions
and a list of crimes for which there are rewards.  Perhaps some civic
organiztions would be willing to donate money for tips leading to arrests
and convictions of any crimes.  Even if it doesn't catch any bad guys, it'd be
great PR for strong crypto, anonymity, ecash and whoever runs it.
