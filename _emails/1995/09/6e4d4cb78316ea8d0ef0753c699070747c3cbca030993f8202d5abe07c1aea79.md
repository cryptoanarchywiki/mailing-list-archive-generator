Ah.  but if there is no plaintext, the question is whether you comply 
with the rule by providing the encrypted text rather than plaintext.  I 
would say you have to provide the plaintext in the absence of a legitimate 
privilege claim, but I don't recall a case to this effect (there is 
precedent for requiring translation of foreign language documents when 
the request is covered by an evidence conention; I don't recall if there 
are any such cases that fall purely under domestic US rules).  Anyone have 
chapter and verse?
