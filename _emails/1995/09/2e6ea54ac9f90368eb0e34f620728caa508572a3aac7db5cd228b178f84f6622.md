NY Times, Sept 13, 1995. For the outawork:


C.I.A.'s Chief Calls Covert Action a Must

Washington, Sept. 12 -- The Central Intelligence Agency
will maintain, and perhaps increase, its covert
operations abroad and continue to hire informers from
terrorist cells, military regimes and drug syndicates,
the new Director of Central Intelligence said today.

The Director, John M. Deutch, called espionage "the core
mission of the Central Intelligence Agency." That mission
has been questioned by critics of the C.I.A. in Congress
and the foreign-policy establishment, who wonder whether
the rewards of secret information are worth the risks of
undertaking covert operations and recruiting murderous
and corrupt foreign agents.
