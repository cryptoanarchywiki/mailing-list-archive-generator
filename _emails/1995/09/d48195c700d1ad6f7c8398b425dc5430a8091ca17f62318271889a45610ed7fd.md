Um, not really. I dunno about you, but I don't bother to get new ROMs from
cisco for each new software release - I FTP the code over the net, and
write it into flash RAM in the routers (or net boot it). So, in fact, there
are many sites (and backbones) for which that statement is literally true.

P.S.    And yes, cisco does publish MD5 hashes of their binaries.
