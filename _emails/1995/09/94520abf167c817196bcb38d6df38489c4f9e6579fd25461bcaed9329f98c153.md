Yes, I'm still working on a magazine, I still need authors! Write
about cryptography and coverups and clipper and whatever else you
find interesting, and write about it!  Become rich and famous! 
(ahtough


although the rich and famous part won't be a result of
writing for TCW...)   I also need reporters to write blurbs about
things that happen.   If interested, mail me privately at 
dr261@cleveland.freenet.edu.. not on the list.
