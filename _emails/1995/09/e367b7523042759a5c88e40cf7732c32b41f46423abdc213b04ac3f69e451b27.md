  What I should have said is that its a very interesting idea.  Given
current perceptions of netscape, I should have made clear that I
wouldn't do something like this without getting a lot more discussion
and review of possible dangers and how to avoid them.  I certainly
can't fault anyone for wondering if we would just implement this
without thinking it through, given recent events.
