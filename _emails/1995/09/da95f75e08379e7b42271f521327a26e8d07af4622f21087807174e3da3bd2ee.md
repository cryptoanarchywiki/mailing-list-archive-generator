Quite true.

This is true. However, you must get 128 bits of entropy into the MD5
-- this can be accompanied by as much junk as you like, but if there
are at least 128 bits of entropy fed in, the MD5 process will distil
it into what you want.

You might want to read RFC 1750, and examine the code PGP uses for
doing its random generation. Clients do lots of fairly random things
while talking to netscape (click and keyboard press times, etc) that
can be incorporated in, along with other sources of bits. You should
grab bits whereever you can and keep them for when you need them, as
getting 128 bits takes a while.

PC timers inherently run at Mhz speed -- they interrupt every 100th of
a second but you can get finer resolution by querying the clock
chip. Does Windows let you do this?

By the way, starting with the time that the program was started is
okay but not great -- I think you probably can only safely assume a
few bits from this.

I wouldn't do that, since it forces you to have a dependancy on
executing a subprocess. 

Were I you, I'd capture the timer on every single keystroke and mouse
click event and feed that in to your entropy generator a la PGP.

By definition, that isn't random. Don't use it.

There are other things you can mix in, besides keystroke and mouse
timings and positions, like system call timings for things that might
take a bit of time.

I can't speak to things on PCs, but...

No, sorry, this is very non-random.

Doesn't change very often.

Thats true, but its better than it could be, and most users will be
running local.

You guys should quit thinking of SSL as a good idea. It might be that
the concept is useful for backward compatibility, but don't think of
it as the universal solution just because you developed it.

I agree. Don't run on the assumption that everyone has root --
otherwise you'll build something that produces less safety than it could.

Actually, Ted Tso built a /dev/rand for Linux, and there are people
trying to port it to other platforms. This is probably a better idea
than a system call.

I've lost my share of nights to security holes announced late in the
day that HAD to be fixed for clients within hours. Welcome to the real
world. You play with the big boys and you get big headaches every once
in a while.
