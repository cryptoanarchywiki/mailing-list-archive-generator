In the relatively short time I've been on this list, Cypherpunks
have bruted, and then found a weakness in, two kinds of Netscape
software.
[A fine public service, IMO. Congrats to all involved.]

I don't expect to know NSA's specific brute-force capability, but
does anyone know if the NSA has *ever* found a glaring weakness in
software and then told its author(s) or owner(s) about it? Do "we"
perform the "COMSEC" role Tim was speaking of better than the NSA?
