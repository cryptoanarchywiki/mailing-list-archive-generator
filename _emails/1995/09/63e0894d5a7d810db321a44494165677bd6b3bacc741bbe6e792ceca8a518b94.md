Nope, that wasn't it, either.

See the Eichin/Rochlis "tour of the worm" paper.  

I was visiting friends at MIT the night the worm hit.  After receiving
some confused and unspecific reports that the worm was getting in
through fingerd, I had a flash of insight as to how that might happen;
as it turned out, this insight was correct, and shortly thereafter, I
had reproduced a benign form of the fingerd attack.  As implemented by
the worm, it only worked on vaxes, but it could have worked on other
systems.

The buffer in question was on the stack, not in static storage.

The attacker wrote a long sequence of NOP's, followed by machine
instructions which implemented the equivalent of exec("/bin/sh"),
followed by the approximate stack address of the stack buffer; the
last address was at the right place to overwrite the saved PC field in
the stack frame.  When the routine "returned", it actually branched
into the runway of NOP's, and then exec'ed "/bin/sh".

Note that the actual stack address varied, as environment variables
(which tend to vary from installation to installation) are located at
the top of the stack.

As it turned out, the attack did not work on most Athena systems,
because the athena /etc/rc complex wound up using a large number of
environment variables which pushed the location of the stack frame in
question out of the range where the attack would have worked.
