In _retrospect_ (:-}), the approach taken by Goldberg and Wagner seems
pretty obvious. Where PGP, for example, asks the user to go through a
laborious process of "generating entropy" through ostensibly-random
keyboard button presses, Netscape does not do this. Nor does it, for
example, "listen" to a microphone input for some amount of time (to at
least make a plausible pretense of gathering entropy), nor does it measure
a Zener diode, or count clicks of a Geiger counter, or whatever.

The very speed of Netscape's PRNG process suggests the usual weakness in
PRNGs: simply not enough entropy. That is, a limited search space allows
the guessing of a seed or entry point in a deterministic process.

I think a reasonable way to generate several hundred seemingly random (or
at least highly unpredictable) bits is the "swirling the mouse" approach
mentioned by several people. All implementations of Netscape involve mice,
I assume, and this is a fairly fast way of generating hard-to-guess bits.
Colin Plumb has code to do this, as has been mentioned. (I'm not saying
that some number of "mouse swirlings" will generate some number of bits of
entropy...this depends on the platform, the granularity of mouse
measurements, etc. Better to take several times as many bits as needed and
distill them down, with MD5 or other hash functions....can't have too many
bits of entropy to start with!)

This could be done fairly quickly by Netscape, and doesn't assume the
platform has microphones to "measure background noise" or other exotic and
nonstandard inputs.

Years ago, I recall articles in sci.crypt about getting "pretty good random
numbers" from complicated measurements of disk accesses on a local machine,
ticks of the system clock, times between keyboard button presses, etc., all
mixed and convolved together. Not perfect, of course, but if enough bits
are started with (e.g, 2000) when "only" 126 or 512 or whatever are
ultimately used, this "mixing" can probably be pretty damned good. At
least, I doubt any t-shirts will be won.

I think a better approach is to modularize the functions, so that a "PRNG"
chunk could be shown without "damaging" Netscape's market situation. (I
doubt the crypto section is seen as Netscape's market edge, and use of
industry-verified crypto modules would be a net plus, anyway.)

In other words, keep secret (arguably) the things you don't want
competitors to have access to. But things like crypto modules are rarely
trade secrets--if only because the cores are so often licensed anyway--and
can be shown and vetted without affecting the rest of the product.

(I said "arguably" because many will argue for showing all of the source
code, anyway, as the almost-ultimate check on integrity and reliabilty. And
there may be subtle security flaws that hinge on the overall program, not
just specific parts.)

See above. This has been a recurring topic in sci.crypt and Cyherpunks---so
recurring, in fact, that several of us have expressed bemusement at seeing
"yet another "How do I generate entropy" argument."

I guess we all (save for Mssrs. Goldberg and Wagner) tacitly assumed that a
modern product claiming to have strong crypto would use commonly-accepted
techniques for generating enough entropy. (Commonly used in RSA's crypto
products, and in PGP.)

I suggest you take RSADSI up on their offer to advise you. (Or Cylink, as
the case may soon be.)
