Or- even easier yet- improper httpd installation or users who have not
been properly trained.  NCSA's default configuration file makes document
root a subtree.  One major institution I deal with regularly (and the
administrators should know better) changed the default setting, allowing
users to store html files in their home directory.  And, it seems, the
file permissions were too lax.  If a user had no index.html then I could
just cruise through their home directory, view most files and, in some
(inappropriate) cases, download them.  I told the administrator, and
mailed him a copy of a user's address book (she was a friend and knew what
I was doing before I did it).  The situation has changed and is now more
secure.  But I wonder how many other institutions have an inappropriate 
DocumentRoot so (I guess) users can have a "single home directory"?
