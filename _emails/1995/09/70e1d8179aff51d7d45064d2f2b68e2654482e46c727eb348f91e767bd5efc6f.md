I was very distressed when Josh gave this presentation; apparently
patents have been filed, etc., and someone from another company
in Europe was claiming they'd _already_ patented it.

What is the story here? From my pov, the performance increase doesn't
justify the ramifications of dealing with yet another potentially
surly patent holder (either Microsoft in your case, or whoever the
irate European fellow was who claims to have already patented it.)
