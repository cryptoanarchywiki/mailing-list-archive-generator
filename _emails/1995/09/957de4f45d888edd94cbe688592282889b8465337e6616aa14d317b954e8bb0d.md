That assumes that you have someway of measuring the timing to microsecond
precision.  On most machines I've been on, if you get something time-
stamped, even if there is a microsecond portion of the timestamp it's
meaningless because it wasn't based on a timer with the required precision.
If a timer can only resolve milliseconds, the microseconds don't have any
meaning.
