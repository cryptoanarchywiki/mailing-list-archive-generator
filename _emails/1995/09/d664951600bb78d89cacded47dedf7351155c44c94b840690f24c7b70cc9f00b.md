Has anyone seen any media coverage of last week's meetings?
I haven't seen anything in either the Washington Post or
the Wall Street Journal. Nothing on radio or local TV either.

I don't expect much coverage, as Joe Sixpack has no knowledge of
why he should be interested. But I expected at least a paragraph
hidden somewhere inside.  Perhaps I missed it.

Anyone else seen any???
