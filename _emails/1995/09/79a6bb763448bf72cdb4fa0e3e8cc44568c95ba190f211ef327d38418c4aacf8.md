My thought was that there might be shortcuts that the attacker
could use to compute the permutation of the state array in less time.

I wrote a small test program to look for cycles and weak keys in the
65536 iteration permutation. I assumed a 40 bit key. One weak key
was found, 0x0101010101, that produces a 255 iteration cycle.
375 randomly chosen keys were tested and no cycles were found.

There ought to be a faster way to compute the permutation with
a more analytical approach. My skepticism tells me that nothing
is a replacement for more key bits.

In a semi-related question, why don't we see Feistel systems with
larger numbers of rounds? Would a modified DES with 256 rounds be
any more secure than standard DES?
