I agree with you that the patent hassle is probably not worth the speed 
increase.  If I came up with the algorithm by myself and on my own time, 
I certainly would not have filed a patent for it, but that wasn't the 
case.  I also agree that the patent system should be abolished, but there 
is nothing I can do about that either.

The speed increase does exist over Montgomery's modular reduction 
because it uses n*n multiplications and 1 division compared to n*(n+1) 
multiplications, and the pre- and post-calculations are much simpler.

Division using Karatsuba multiplication does seem to have a better 
asymptote, but is probably slower for most practical lengths.  Both 
Lenstra's LIP and Lacy's CryptLib use Montgomery for modular reduction.

The numbers you give are a bit off.  Assuming a 32-bit machine,
n=64 implies a 2048-bit modulus, and a 4096-bit number to be reduced. 
Also, Karatsuba should use 1/3 (2*64^1.58 / 64^2) the multiplications
rather than 1/5.
