Someone already tried that. The cops got a copy of the WWW logs and 
started investigating everyone who'd looked at the WWW page... So at the 
least you'd need a bunch of anonymous WWW proxies as well.

There's also the problem that the current ecash systems do not provide 
payee anonymity, so if you pay informers with ecash they can be traced if 
the bank and payer collude.
