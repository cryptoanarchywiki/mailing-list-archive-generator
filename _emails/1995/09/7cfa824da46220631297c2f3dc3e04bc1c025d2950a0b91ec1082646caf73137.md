For fun ways to hack NT, check out http://www.somar.com/security.html.
 Some of these are really laughable.  You can use NT's LogonUser API
call to repeatedly guess passwords until you hit it, since NT offers
no way to limit number of login attempts.
	There also is no way to stop remote users from modifying the
registry.  *Any* user with an account can remotely dump and modify the
system registry.  So in theory you can write a bruteforce program to
keep guessing until it gets a password, then modify the registry to
make the system to "interesting" things.  The worst part of all this
is that the Registry is very poorly documented, MSoft must consider
most of that info "confidential."
	Fortunately, when using NT's SMB services such as drive and file
sharing, passwords are never sent in the clear.  Just make sure you
disable that "Guest" account.:)
