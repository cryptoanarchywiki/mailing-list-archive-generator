And the idea is that on decrypting with the 'wrong' key, it outputs the
dummy file rather than the real plaintext, correct?

Why would they use your copy of the program to decrypt the file?  They
could just use a version that lacked this 'feature'.  Of course, they
still couldn't get at the real plaintext unless you gave them the key,
but you are right back to the same old standoff where they say, "Give
us your key," and you (try to) say, "No."
