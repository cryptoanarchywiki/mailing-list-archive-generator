This scheme doesn't quite work.  (Let's call Amalgameted Bob, to keep
names short.)  Bob can create a new, unlinkable pseudonym and give the same
offer to Carol under the new pseudonym.  Then, Bob acts as Mallet and
passes messages back and forth between Alice and Carol.  At the end of the
10 free questions, Bob terminates its contract with Alice, leaving Alice
with nothing and Bob's pseudonym a certain amount of reputation with
Carol.

Fingerprinting may be useful in some situations, but is clearly not a
perfect solution to this problem.  Alice may be able to prove to Mallet's
customers that she originally wrote the answers, but if their
communications with Mallet are private, how does Alice even know who those
customers are?  Also, I'm not too familiar with fingerprinting
technologies, but Mallet may be able to remove the identifying marks by
translating the answers to a different form while preserving the meaning.
