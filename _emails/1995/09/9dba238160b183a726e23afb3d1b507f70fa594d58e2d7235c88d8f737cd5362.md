Nobody accepts unsolicited scripts for legal reasons.  The real 
question is, do they accept outside scripts?  Some shows do; some
shows don't.  IF they do, they will send freelance writers a show
"bible," which is a writer's guide to the basic rules concerning
the structure, history, characters, etc. of the show.  If you're
interested, you should drop them a note asking in they accept
scripts from outsiders.  Giving the production offices a call
would let you know what their attitude is about submissions.
