That's what so nice about the nets.  You don't (won't) have to "live in the
world" any more.  The creation of consentual halucinations (virtual worlds)
allows you to "change the world" at will.

And once the interface improves...

Actually, the creation of separate "spaces" that can only be entered with
your (each person's) permission will have a big impact on life in the real
world.
