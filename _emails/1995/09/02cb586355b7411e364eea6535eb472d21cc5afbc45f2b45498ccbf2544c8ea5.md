Better yet, ban both strncpy and strncat.  Replace them with
differently-named routines (strbcpy and strbcat?) that, given a buffer
length, are GUARANTEED to always give you a properly terminated string
that (including the terminator) does not overflow the specified
buffer.

Even better, use a good string class that does all this automatically
all the time.
