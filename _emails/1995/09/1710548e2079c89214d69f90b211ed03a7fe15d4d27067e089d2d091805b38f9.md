     This is the second or third time I've seen descriptions of such
     raids where cult (no, I'm not trying to be diplomatic)
     representatives were present and participating.  Is this legal in
     Amsterdam?  How about in the U.S.?  Britain?

     If a police officer has a warrant then I really don't have much
     choice about letting him in.  Am I also under an obligation to
     allow the people who filed for the warrant into my home or
     business?

     Thanks,

     Mole Rat
