You should consciously be aware that the U.S. Government *will* break 
it's own laws to further it's goals.  You should know that such as law as 
"this shall be the law unless the fuhrher disagrees andf then what the 
furhrer says shall be the new law"  [yes, such a law was in Nazi 
Germany's lawbooks]  in the states we call it "Executive Order" and with 
the U.S. beiong one of the most powerful outlaw governments on this 
planet, you should watch them anyway.  Dont count on your citizenship or 
location outside of the US as protecting you.   If they want you, you are 
dead-meat.  You know it too!


BTW, if you are going to say 'well the US has a Constitutioon, we'll we 
*dont* it was suspended in 1933...
