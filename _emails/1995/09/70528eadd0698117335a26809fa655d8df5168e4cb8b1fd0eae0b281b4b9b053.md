Jeff,

	I'm collecting lists of ASN.1 problems as well as better solutions.
If you'd care to contribute....

Otherwise, I'll post the results when they're firmed up.  I got some
*great* material from Burt Kaliski at the P1363 meeting and that needs
to be folded in, so I know it's not soup yet.
