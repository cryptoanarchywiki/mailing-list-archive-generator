3. Unescrowed crypto banned, with advanced stego, panic passwords, 
stealth PGP, incorporated remailers all across international borders 
making offenders impossible to identify or catch.

Given the degree to which I believe 1. unlikely in the numbers required 
to avoid the unescrowed encryption ban, I believe the goal is to 
propogate crypto far enough to at least have a salient "underground" 
participants.

Some months ago I called for advanced stego and stealth PGP as well as 
larger keys in the event we all had to go "into the crypto closet" for a 
time.

I call for them again.
