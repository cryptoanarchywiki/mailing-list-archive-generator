They really are not getting it - are they stupid or what?
Scientology people are not behaving so I take a standing
that I don't have to behave when I treat them as well.
Good, remember they started it ...

Sorry to hear that Mr. Braan

O camoon - that name sounds great what's
inside it? Research department of Brainwashing?
Wast that the technology you tried to sell
to CIA? And luckily CIA told you to piss off.

We would need a list of all legal offices representing scienos 
in all countries. Also does anyone has a list of top scienos
and some kind of organization flow chart of this evil 
emperium?

Does anyone has tel number to these Co$s?

Good - you have civilised police there.

They wan't a war - well let's give them one! I don't mean this
bashing in the net - I mean a REAL WAR! Co$ has been on
offensive for some time now and they must be got to the defence mode.

I think it would be a jolly good day if they would try that against 
me. I would make best of it...

Screw with their permission.

Sorry for the raw language but I get so damn angry when I even see
these scienos mentioned. 

To fight them we need an organization to fight them. Todays
situation is like uncontrolled and thefore unoptimised guerrilla
operations. Results will be weak.
