An interesting article appeared on Page B1 of the 9/7/95 San
Francisco Examiner.  Titled "Keystroke Cops," it discusses the FBI's
new cyberswat team.  In the midst of a routine discussion of whether
law enforcement needs to keep up with cyberspace criminals, the
following intriguing quote appeared.
 
"Already, Fuentes said, federal authorities in New York are
investigating whether programmers hired to write software for a
financial institution may have left a 'back door' open in the
program, one through which money may have been diverted to foreign
bank accounts."
 
Does anyone know what this federal investigation in New York is
about?   How about copying this note around and seeing what people
can find out?
