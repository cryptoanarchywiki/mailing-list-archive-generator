Marcel--  I'm sorry that my comments upset you so much, but I do not 
believe that they were unwarranted.  It is true that the cyberbucks demo 
is insecure in some ways, such as using insecure e-mail.  On the other 
hand your response that the demo is not about e-mail, it is about E-cash, 
and that you don't have the manpower to invest in making those extraneous 
things secure, is a good one and I am satisfied.


The only thing I wish I had done differently was to make the title of the
message "weak links in cyberbucks demo".  There are, as far as I am aware, no
weak links in the DigiCash system.


I sincerely wish your company the best success, although I fear that
MicroSoft and Visa and the like will successfully market inferior systems by
use of their money and mindshare.  In fact, a large part of the reason that
I chose to sell BAP via a cybershop was to draw more attention to Ecash.  
I hope it is working.  I guess if you have about a two-week queue for free
cyberbucks, then maybe in a week I will get a whole lot of BAP purchases.
:-)


Regards,

Bryce
