Dave.  Sorry you didn't catch the implied change of tone in the above.  I
meant to show a switch from Space Cadet rhetoric about the nets to a more
realistic view.

These separate spaces won't wipe out the Real World (used with permission)
but they will influence it as a form of private property that is self
enforcing neither dependent on force for protection nor capable of being
penetrated by force.  This is a BIG THING.  You can't live in it yet but you
will certainly be able to trade digital goods and services there and stash
digital goods (work product, databases, etc.).

Having a place that is under your exclusive control has enormous practical
and psychological implications.  Think of the change that occurred when
peasants came to be able to own land.  Cyberspace contains spaces that can
be cheaply created, individually owned, and free of confiscation.  And since
the bulk of the wealth of OECD countries is non-physical (consisting of
various forms of ownership rights and "choses in action") that wealth can be
protected cryptographically.

Don't you like the idea of a "place" that's yours alone?  It's not dangerous
(to you).  It increases your choices.  Your power.
