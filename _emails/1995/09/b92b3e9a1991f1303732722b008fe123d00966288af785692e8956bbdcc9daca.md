Clint Brooks of NSA repeated this assertion, at least once.  He said it
during the August 17, 1995 meeting as well.

I find this interesting, not least as a violation of security.  This
amounts to an open declaration that NSA can break through 64-bit keys.

Could it be that NSA was miffed at being upstaged in the announcement of
breaking through a 40-bit key and wanted to up the ante? .... :-)
