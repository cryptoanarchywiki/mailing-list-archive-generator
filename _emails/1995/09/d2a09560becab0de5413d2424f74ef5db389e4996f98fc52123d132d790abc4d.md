There's nothing inherently wrong with using popen or system.  The problem
arises when you use information given to you from outside as the argument
to popen or system without checking it.  You should have an awareness that
whatever you pass to system or popen is essentially being passed as the
commandstring to a:

    execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", commandstring, (char *)0);

Make sure you know the implications of this.  If you know that what you're
passing can happily be exec'd directly, it's more efficient to do an exec 
yourself instead of (effectively) having a sh exec'd to exec your code.
Of course you can see that you shouldn't do something like:

    cout << "Enter the directory to list: " 
    cin >> buffer;
    system(buffer);

especially if you're running with any sort of priviledges.  Suppose someone
entered:

    / ; echo >>/etc/passwd "gotcha::0:0:Intruder Man:/:/sbin/sh

Obviously if this program was being run as root you'd be in trouble.
If it was running as a user it would let them do something like add
an .rhosts for the user that would let them get on the machine.  Once
on a machine it's often fairly easy to leverage that access into root
access.

Oh well, I could talk about security all day:)
