Depends on the department.  They have at least one manager at Netscape with
a permenent case of high blood preasure.  (He happens to be in charge of the
support department.)

If he is not running X Windows, he is going to be searching along time for
the Compass easter egg.  You also need X windows to find the Mozilla
animated icon hack on Jammie Zawinski's page.  Which easter eggs that are
available is dependant on which client you are running.

obNetscapeHack:  There is a feature called a "cookie file" in Netscape that
is ripe for exploitation as a security leak.  If you are using a Netscape
server (and you may not even need that), you can feed all sorts of
information into it without the user's knowlege.  I have heard of one page
that overloads the cookie file until the machine runs out of drive space.  I
am sure that there are other exploitable holes there...  Any takers?
