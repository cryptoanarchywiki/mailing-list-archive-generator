    On today's machines, it's a little more complicated than that. 
After you XOR the key, you have to then flush all the cache lines that
contain the key, to make sure that the XOR operation makes it to the
main memory.  Unless I'm mistaken, a write-back cache will not propogate
the XOR operation to main memory unless another memory operation(s)
forces bumps the XORed key out of cache memory.  Successive XOR
operations on the key won't necessarily do this; you need some other
memory op to flush the cache lines.
