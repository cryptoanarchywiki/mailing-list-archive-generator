Real Answer:  Because they're all a bunch of crooks.  PKP was formed
for the purpose of monopolizing the market and screwing the customers. 
Unfortunately, RSA and Cylink were too busy trying to screw each other
that they forgot what their real mission was.

According to the settlement, RSA made only one offer, which Cylink
refused.  (Which was all that RSA was obligated to do.)

Maybe not, but it looks like RSA has their own spin doctors working
on it as well.
