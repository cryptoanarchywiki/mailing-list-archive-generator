It's even worse - the seeding mechanism has too little entropy, given that
you know some of the input data (e.g. system clock), but if it had, say,
32 bits of entropy, you'd have to run your test tens or hundreds of billions
of times for the patterns to really show up - which is hard to do for something
that uses the system clock or other hardware - and you'd really have to get
at the output of the seeding process rather than the PRNG output, which has
been filtered through enough MD5 that it's hard to detect the patterns.
But you could still crack it easily enough.
