There was a hack to pgp ui published a while back that would allow
someone decrypting a RSA encrypted file to print out the idea key.

Another feature of the hack allowed someone with the idea key to decrypt
an RSA PGP encrypted file ignoring the RSA headers and using the IDEA
key directly.

Using this software should allow the reciever of an RSA PGP encrypted
file to allow someone else to decrypt it (by giving them the IDEA key)
without exposing the secret key. The IV block check will  allow them to
check that they are using the correct idea key.
