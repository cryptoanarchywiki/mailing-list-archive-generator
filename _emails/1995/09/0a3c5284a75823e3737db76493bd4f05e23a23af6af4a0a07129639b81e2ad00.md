Would the person who expressed interest in my collection of genuine AT&T
UNIX for the AT&T 6300 (an 8086) and 6300 Plus (an 80286) complete with
several shelf feet hard cover doccumentation  as well as the developer kit
please get in touch with me?

As for the rest of you: you may stop laughing now ;-)
