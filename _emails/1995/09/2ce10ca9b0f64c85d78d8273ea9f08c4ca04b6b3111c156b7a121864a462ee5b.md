Wow.  I just checked, and Nelson's right.

The seed is this:
#ifdef ITIMER_REAL
    {
        struct timeval  now;

        X_GETTIMEOFDAY (&now);
        ldata[0] = now.tv_sec;
        ldata[1] = now.tv_usec;
    }
#else
    {
        long    time ();

        ldata[0] = time ((long *) 0);
        ldata[1] = getpid ();
    }
#endif

and if you don't have XDMAUTH defined, the auth value is this:

        seed = (ldata[0]) + (ldata[1] << 16);
        srand (seed);
        for (i = 0; i < len; i++)
        {
            value = rand ();
            auth[i] = value & 0xff;
        }


Oh, well.  We knew X didn't have much in the way of security, anyway...

   - Ian
