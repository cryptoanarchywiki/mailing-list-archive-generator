It wouldn't be hard, though I'm not sure it's much different from requiring
the owner of the public key to decrypt the document in the first place.
It does give you some verifiability (somebody else can take the session key
and demonstrate that encrypting it with the recipient's public key does or 
does not produce the encrypted-key string in the document being verified.)
If that's what you plan to use it for, you would also need to have the
entire padded session key and not just the session key itself.

Total amount of work to implement - another command-line option, a print
statement,
and maybe another command-line option and bit of code to allow decryption of a
public-key-encrypted document using a command-line-supplied session key.
