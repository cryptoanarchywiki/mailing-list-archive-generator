Okay, so what's stopping you from starting right now with PGP?
You could simply have that as an alternative to the current system
(on a per-ID basis, ie new customers specify PGP or not).

started using it.

How about "The safest Internet payment system just got safer."?

On sweeney, I may delete without reading!
PGP 463A14D5 (but it's at home so it'll take a day or two)
PGP EF0607F9 (but it's at uni so don't rely on it too much)
