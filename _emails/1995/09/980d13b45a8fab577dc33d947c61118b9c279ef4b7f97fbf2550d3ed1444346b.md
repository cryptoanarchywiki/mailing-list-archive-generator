I'm still running MSDOS, so I suppose net connectivity isn't much
of an issue :)  At any rate, I set my randseed.bin to a length of 0
and then made in un-writable, so that new random bits have to be
generated every time.  It's not too much of a trouble for me;
most of my PGP use is just signing messages to certain interested
parties.  How would Netscape handle the fact that there aren't any
random bits here?

Opinions this ludicrous are mine.  Rational ones will cost you.
Heh
