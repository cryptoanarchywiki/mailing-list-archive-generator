The breakout session that I was in was directly charged with this issue.
We talked at length about it. There were NIS&T and NSA folks at the session.
The consensus was that the Government wanted to prevent a version of PGP
that was export enabled (GAK and short keys) that would be backward
compatible.

The group stated strongly that this was a "non starter." That is,
it was unacceptable. Vendors wanted "sales appeal." That means
compatibility with existing software. And compatibility with existing
export-approved systems. [DES has been exported to "friendly" countries
with strict controls.]

And criteria #2 specifically outlawed superencryption.
No DES | TRAN | DES | TRAN | DES.
They were serious. talk to CME, he was in that session.

I believe that this criteria is stupid, or at least ill-advised.
But the govies insisted.

All the more justification to ignore the US rules and develop
off-shore.
