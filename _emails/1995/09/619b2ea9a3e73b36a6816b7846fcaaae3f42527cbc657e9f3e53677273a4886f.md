I think a media contact group is a good idea too, but I think we should
handle it by having a special address <cypherpunks-press@toad.com> that
media people can send to to request information and that it should split
the incoming mail and route it to a group of volunteers who could then
respond. Question from media people are usually NOT going to be heavily
tech-oriented, and this sort of press list would give the lesser
cryptologists among us, who nevertheless have a significant amount of
knowledge about public policy issues concerning crypto, a chance to be
useful.

BTW, <pgp-help-humans@hks.net> is still operating, and the small group of
knowledgeable cypherpunks there all see the mail that comes in and cc the
list when someone asks a PGP question and gets it answered by one or more
of the volunteers. This would be a good model to expand on, imho. Everyone
learns something, people go away impressed by the quality answers, etc. :)
