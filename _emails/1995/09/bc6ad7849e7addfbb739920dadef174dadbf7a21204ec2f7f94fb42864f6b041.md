After thinking about this (and drinking more coffee) I realized that he is
loading the GUEST.EXE driver.  This is not the best way to get the Zip drive
to work.  (It is meant as a temporary fix.)  There is actually a set of
drivers that can be installed in the config.sys file.  (Check the
documentation for installing the ASPI drivers and install the PPA3 driver as
the first of the three.)  This is poorly documented by Iomega, but it works.
