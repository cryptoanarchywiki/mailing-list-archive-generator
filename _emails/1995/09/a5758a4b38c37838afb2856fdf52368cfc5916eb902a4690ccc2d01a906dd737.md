Exactly. As someone recently pointed out, the practical result
would only be to define a new class of single-crime criminals
(cypherpunks/cyphercriminals).

In my .se perspective this is emphasized by our penalty system.
In the foreseeable future (10 years?) they would never get away
with a harsher penalty for using un-GAKed crypto than a moderate
fine. To 'real' criminals, who usually don't have open assets to
forfeit (and the current praxis is then to forget about it after
a few years) and no reputation as law-abiders to defend, it would
be a joke, of course.
