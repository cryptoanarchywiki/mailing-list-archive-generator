SecureDrive Users,

I have seen inquires here and received direct e-mail enquirinq about
SecureDrive and WIN95, and the Iomega zip disk.

I have recently heard from users that SecureDrive 1.3d does work on
Windows 95, although it does force it into "DOS Compatibility Mode",
which is a performance hit on disk access.  I've also heard that LOGIN
does not work from a WIN95 DOS window, so has to be issued outside of
Windows.

I haven't heard anything specific about SecureDrive 1.4, but I believe
it should work the same as 1.3d on WIN95.

I'm sorry to report that SecureDrive does not support the Iomega ZIP
drive.  I believe that's because the TSR driver supplied with the
hardware does not support a DiskBIOS interface.

I had thought that Secure Device, another real-time encryption system,
would support this drive, since it works through a device driver
mapped to a dos file.  But an actual trial proved otherwise.  The
problem is that the DOS file must be present when the CONFIG.SYS
DEVICE= statement for the SECDEV.SYS is processed. But the zip drive
driver is a TSR that doesn't get loaded until after all DEVICE
statements have been processed.  There's no particular reason that
Iomega couldn't have written their driver as an MSDOS device driver
rather than a TSR, in which case SecureDevice would probably work, but
they didn't, so it doesn't.

Hope this info is helpful.  If any of you discover any interesting new
facts using SecureDrive, please let me know.
