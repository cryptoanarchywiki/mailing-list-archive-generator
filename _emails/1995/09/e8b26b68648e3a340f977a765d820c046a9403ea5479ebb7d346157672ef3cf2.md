At least you notified me.. :) Something the TRW crew or others like them 
do not do.

This is true.. I could adopt a nym, such as I use on my BBS, or when I am 
doing other stuff on the net.. but it is difficult at best to get a new 
set of credit cards, ID and so on with a new name/alias and still 
maintain your own name. If it were possible to have an alias in real 
life, as easy as it is to get one on the 'net that is, then I would most 
certainly do so..
