My previous post about the Cryptography Technical Report Server (CTRS)
contained a bad URL, so some of you who tried to access it recently
weren't able to find it.  My apologies.

The problem has been fixed, though, so CTRS can now *really* be found at

		    <http://www.itribe.net/CTRS/>
				  or
		    <https://www.itribe.net/CTRS/>

We're upgrading our SPARC Webserver to a spiffy new Challenge-S, so
not only should you now have no problem finding CTRS, but it should
also respond pretty quickly.
