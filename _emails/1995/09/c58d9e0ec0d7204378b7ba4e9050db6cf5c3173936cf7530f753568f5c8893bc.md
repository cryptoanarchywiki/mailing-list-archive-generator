I know of three ways to get software:

1. Write it yourself.
2. Pay someone else to write it.
3. Find software someone else wrote that meets your needs.

If (3) isn't working, perhaps you should try (1) or (2). 

(I've been "calling for" a big house with a hot tub for years now.
Still no progress. I'll let you know if it works out.)
