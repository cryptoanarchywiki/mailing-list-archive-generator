Actually there is a limit of 20 cokies per web server.
I will have to check to see if there is a limit on the size of
the cookie. And no you dont need a Netscape server. Its just another
HTTP header. What about this: downloading a encoded picture
contating graphic description of sex with minors. Would the FBI go around 
checking peoples cookie files and busting them?
