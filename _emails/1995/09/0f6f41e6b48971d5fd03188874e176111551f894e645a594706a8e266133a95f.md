Actually, the most recently-added key will be the one that is
used.. So updating your encryption key works fine, since the most
recent encryption key will be on top, and hense used first.

True.. To get around this problem you need the concept of a two-key
certificate... However a rogue user could still use the signature
key to encrypt, so I'm not sure that even this would help the problem.
