| For the next version, include PGP free with every version of Quicken,
| and have Quicken just "call" PGP.

| Of course, users can encrypt their files now with PGP.  Is there an
| Intuit bboard where someone could post instructions?

	Of course, it would be *much* easier to store Quicken + data
files on an encrypted filesystem (Cryptdisk or SFS).  To start
quicken, the user starts Cryptdisk, runs Quicken on his encrypted
files (now transparently available), and then quits.  Cryptdisk
disappears 5 minutes later.

	Thus, Intuit isn't putting crypto calls which might be illegal
into their code.  They maintain a single code base, a single version
in the warehouses, and continue to lobby Congress to change the laws.

	(Quicken gets stored on the encrypted area so that it won't
start up and say 'where are my data files?')

	Naturally, this works with programs other than Quicken.
