Sounds good, but having publicly implementable standards would be nicer;
licensable patented code is enough of a hassle, without having standards
that have *trade secrets* built into them.  RC2 as an option is fine;
RC2 as a mandatory part of a conforming implementation is pretty tacky.

Actually, it turns out that the latest RIPEM has certificate chains, Web of
Trust,
and really just about everything I want, except perhaps user-friendly GUIs,
which could be added easily enough.  I haven't yet sorted out which
parts are in the export-approved RIPEM-SIG and which parts are only in RIPEM2.1,
but it's a pretty straightforward job.  (Now to go scrounge some disk space!)
The RIPEM code is all public-domain, and uses RSAREF for its crypto,
so exporting the non-RSAREF parts is copyright/patent clean, and maybe
it can be possible to put together a CJ-able version of the new stuff
so it can gain legitimacy after having been exported for months :-)
