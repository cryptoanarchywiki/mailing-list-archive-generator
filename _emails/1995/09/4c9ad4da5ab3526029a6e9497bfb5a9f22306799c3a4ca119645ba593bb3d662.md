I think it *tremendously* disturbing that the F.B.I. suddenly thinks 
itself part of the Legislative branch, able to make law and dictate 
policy to the rest of the country.

In fact there is a plague of this kind of thing, law making in the wrong 
channels, as if the executive agencies in the United States were suddenly 
able to implement their own law.

I think the F.B.I. needs to act like the Executive agency it is, advice 
the president, and then generally shut up.

In short, like small children, the F.B.I. should be seen, and not heard.

Unfortunately, I believe the children in this case will be Citizens of 
the United States.
