This struck me as rather ironic in the wake of The Govt. Could Be Reading
_Your_ Home Page. It also sparked me to draw the short connection between
industrial espionage (and simple industrial nosiness), and anonymous Web
proxies. An obvious point, really, but companies often have an interest in
concealing the nature/extent of their Web crawlings, too. Perhaps there's a
market niche, or a few pro-anonymity publicity points, here for someone.
