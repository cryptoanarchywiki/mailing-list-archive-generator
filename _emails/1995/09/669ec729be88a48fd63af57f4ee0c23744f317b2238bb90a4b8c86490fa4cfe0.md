This idea seems to get proposed every few years. In the past it
has been shelved as soon as someone figures out the disaster that
would be caused by the resultant decline in the value of the
dollar. The U.S. Government has to be nice to foreigners that hold large
quantities of dollars and treasury securities, even if it doesn't
care about the political consequences at home.
