No disrespect intended, but I think that the various "let's sanitize
the Cypherpunk message for mass acceptance" marketing/soundbite 
proposals are pointless. Cypherpunks is a mailing list, not a political
party (or a platform). 

- From my perspective, the organizing meme for the list is not "strong
crypto is really important, so let's write some and lobby our lawmakers
to make sure it stays legal" but "strong crypto is here and is changing
the dynamics of force, politics, and power, so let's see what we can 
do with it."

(And no, I don't think it's important to spread that "meme" (a term
I use with some trepidation) around to get "market share" for it.
Ideas are not football teams nor initiative proposals.)

I appreciate and support and have participated in various write-yer-
legislator activities. They're useful short-term. But if Tim May and
Duncan Frissell and the other list members who've dared to make predictions
about the impact of crypto on government and economics are correct,
what the government and the legislators want doesn't matter. If they're
wrong, what we want doesn't matter.
