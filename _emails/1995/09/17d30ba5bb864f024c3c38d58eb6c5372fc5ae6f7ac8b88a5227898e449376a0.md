Not likely.  It's the kind of machine Sandia _would_ use, especially
since they seem to be getting good support for nuclear-related
boondoggles even after the demise of the Cold War, and it's
also the kind of thing they could use for commercial applications
if they lose their nuclear funding, or use to say "But we _need_
to keep funding this program, we haven't yet gotten our money's
worth out of this big expensive computer", etc.
Also, the cost is roughly $5K/processor, which is probably more
than you'd need to build a MPP key-cracker, which doesn't need
as much interaction between processors.
