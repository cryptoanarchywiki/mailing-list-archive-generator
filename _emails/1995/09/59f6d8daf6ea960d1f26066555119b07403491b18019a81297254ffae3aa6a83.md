Thats the weirdest statement about the dialectic I've ever heard -- it
bears no resemblance to what the man was talking about
whatsoever. Hegel was discussing a theory of how historical changes
occur, not suggesting a way to achieve change. You also have his dates
wrong -- 200 years too early. The comment also had nothing whatsoever
to do with the topic of this mailing list.
