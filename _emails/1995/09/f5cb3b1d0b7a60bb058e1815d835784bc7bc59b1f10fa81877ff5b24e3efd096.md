Hi!

How much computing power did we actually
use, in terms of MIPS/FLOPS*hours?

An unloaded SS10 that didn't swap went at
approximately 16400 keys/s. How many
MIPS is an SS10 approximately?

How does different algoritms compare?
DES, RC40, RSA512 etc?

Or if I pose the question differently,
what can you do with 30 GIPS for a day?

/Christian
