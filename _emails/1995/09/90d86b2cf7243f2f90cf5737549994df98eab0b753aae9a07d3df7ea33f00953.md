I think I understand your position now.

To me there is little difference in how one is persuaded against one's 
will.  Certainly I dislike violence, but some of the "persuasive" methods 
in a market economy sicken me just as much as force might.

In any event, your construction makes sense to me, even if I do not find 
it useful myself.
