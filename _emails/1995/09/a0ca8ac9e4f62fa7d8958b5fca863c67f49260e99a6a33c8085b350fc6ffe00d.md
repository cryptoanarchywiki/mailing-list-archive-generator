	I would just like to point out that, when a LEA comes to you
to get at the contents of your computer, (s)he is not going to
patiently wait while your system wipes the offending evidence off your
hard disk.  The first thing they do is make a copy of everything, so
they can work from the copy.  Besides, you do have backup tapes laying
around all over the place, don't you?
