Is this a new discovery?  When I used to work with DOD classified
data, not so long ago, disk drives had to be declassified using an
approved program, such as Norton Utilities' "WIPEINFO".  (That was
approved up through the SECRET/SAR level, anyway.  I don't know
about TS/SCI/SI.)  But those same regulations said that RAM was
considered declassified within a certain time (30 seconds, I think)
after power was removed.  (That time figure was UNclassified, BTW.)
I think it was just to allow time for the voltage to bleed off of
the power supply's filter capacitors, and not related to the
relative volatility of DRAM.
