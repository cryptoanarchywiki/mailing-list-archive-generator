I got the ad (and a subsequent review copy, upon request) after we 
published the first issue of the Journal of Law & Technology on the 
web.  It appears that they got my name, and address, from the web 
(both are displayed in the "Contacting the Journal" page).

I haven't had much time to read the book, but my recollection is that 
it is somewhat misguided in its analysis of privacy online.  Its 
historical perspective is fairly thorough, however.
