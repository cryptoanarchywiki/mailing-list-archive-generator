So you wouldn't consider the Hollywood blacklist coercive?

What about revocation of tax free status?

I could go on for hours of examples how one can be hurt without a 
physical element.

In the context I was using them, they mean whatever the licenser 
(certifying authority if you prefer) says they mean- this is part of the 
point.

Which, I think, is your key error- particularly in the context of this 
licensing issue, where the difference is nearly invisible.

I think your hangup is one of overdemonizing the state to the point where 
no other evils seem to exist.

Like TRW.  Would you argue there is no coercive power in this entity?  
Yet they are not affiliated with government.

And as I indicated before, one need not threaten violence to coerce.

I will point to the TRW example again.

I think you have failed to apply them to other organizations.  Again, I 
think you are over amoured with hating "the state."  Many organizations 
not affiliated with government do violence to abstract properties.

If I am a producer in a horizontal territory limitation agreement for 
sales of wigets, and bob is not, bob's attempt to move into my area and 
sell widgets will be met with a boycott by all the members of my 
agreement.  Is this any less coercion?  I understand the violence is 
fairly dramatic coercion, but it is hardly the only coercion.  Do you not 
consider the Clipper program coercion?

I suggest you take a look at Nozick, Coercion, in Philisophy, Science and 
Method  (S. Morgenbessed ed. 1969) or Zimmerman, Coervice Wage Offers, 10 
Phil & Pub. Aff. 121 (1981)  Also, see Kreimer, Allocational Sanctions: 
The Problem of Negative Rights in a Positive State, 132 U. Pa. L. Rev. 
1293 (1984).

Personally I think Justice Stone had it correct with "Threat of loss, not 
hope of gain, is the essence of economic coercion."

You might also take a look at the Yale Law Review article by Reich:
(73 Yale 7 I think)

Exactly, it must be tied to some kind of authority.  In this case, the 
issuing institution is about the only acceptable one.

I stand by the contention that a University degree cannot be certified 
acceptably by an authority not in some way connected to the University.

You are using coercion in a different sense.  One of the definitions I 
get in Webster's (while force is incorporated in some others) is "to 
compel to do something by the use of power, intimidation or threats."

If you perfer that I use "serious persuasion" instead, fine, but I think 
you are just splitting hairs.

You needn't apologize, but I must admit, this looks a lot like coercion 
to me, as well as to Reich, and several justices of the Supreme Court.  

Do you believe it impossible/insignificant to manipulate behavior by 
persuasive means other than violence or the threat of actual physical 
violence?

An example please?  With specific regard to certifing authorities and 
university degrees?

But certainly all lawyers must have some base level of certification, 
even if this is only market enforced?  i.e. no one would accept a lawyer 
with NO certification (or few enough people to make it impossible to be 
one with some certification) this being so, the withholding of the 
required certification is still co- er... persuasion, no?

I still am having trouble understanding your definition of coercion.

There is no PHYSICAL violence, this I have admitted, but the economic 
violence of such an act can be significant.  It seems that for you the 
distinction is in the emotional effect of the application of persuasive 
force, rather than the effect.

I've given this example before.

We take two convicted carjackers.

The first we sentence to 5 years, but after 4 years and 50 weeks, tell 
him that we are going to extend the sentence another 10 years unless he 
takes an experimental vaccine.

The second we sentence to 15 years, and after 4 years and 50 weeks, we 
tell this one that we will cut off 10 years from the sentence if he takes 
the experimental vaccine.

What's the difference?  Both have been given two choices

1>  Spend 15 years, no vaccine.
2>  Spend 5 years, take vaccine.

The point is that the first is emotionally more stacked, you feel sorry 
for the carjacker (well, maybe I should have picked crypto exporter) 
because he has been tricked.  When asked, 90% respond that the first is 
more "unfair."

Allowing emotion to cloud one's judgement of what is and is no coercive 
is a mistake.

Let me dig it up.

I believe that your defining the words merely to distinguish who the 
certifing authority is confusing- and deceptive.

I still think you are mistaken in that I feel you are ignoring the fact 
that no market exists below a certain certification level, regardless of 
how diverse the certifiers are.  You also still miss that credentials for 
attorneies are already multidimensional.

I will point to the oil companies in the industrial age, as well as the 
railroads.  Certainly the potential for violence is not limited to 
government.  I hate this example, but in this particular case I think you 
are missing its context.

Then how do you explain the points I have brought up.

The base requirement of a certification from an education institution 
(for which you have provided no substitute).

The existance of a floor, below which it is impractical to practice a 
profession and the existance of a set of entities (of whatever number) 
who's signatures are required to transcend this floor.

I think this construction is still flawed.  I will remain by my position 
that licensing is useful when not used to collect taxes or 
otherwise overregulate.  I also hold that the distinctions you make 
between licensing and certification are without functional difference in 
effect and are deceptive in that they suggest a significant difference in 
effect or purpose where there is none.
