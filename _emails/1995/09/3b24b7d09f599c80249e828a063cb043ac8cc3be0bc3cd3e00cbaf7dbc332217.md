Well they are just doing what their charter says they
should be doing - gathering information.

I think that's because White House workers has access to 
net and of course they are surfing like all the rest of us
- they are just people you know :-) If that would be 
part of something hard level information gathering
I assure you they would not leave so clear traces.

So are you saying White House by itself checked out those places
or are you saying that *people* working inside the White House
happened to be interested issues available on those sites and 
accessed them. And so what it is public information when it
is on the WWW - isn't it?

Probably both

Probably to read it and maybe learn something from it :-)

Hell I am keeping my own records and on the other hand I am in the
process to get/buy/snatch/built a system where I could automatically
scan all the newsgroups with some kind of AI system and to keep
an eye on certain FTP, GOPHER,WAIS, WWW and so on to keep
me bether informed. This partly because this information from 
interne is getting out of proportion AND quite a big part of it
is just rubbish and wasting your time.

Probably they do and they really should. If I was Mr. Clinton (which 
I luckily am not) I would want my adjudats to prepare a report for
me each morning summing up all the possible comments round 
subject Clinton and The USA from NET: That would be very precisious
source of feedback to finetune your acts. And that information 
is real time.

Totally another thing which somehow belongs to this subject
should intelligence bodies watch for the net.

I am middle reading Spycatcher book. Btw I don't understand
all the hype rouund it and I would say in that book there is
not enough substance to ban it's printing in certain countries.

Anyway again in that book it becomes clear that the most
riskiest part of the agent and therefore on of the best way
to unweil them is to concentrate on their communications
with the coordinators in that particular country or on 
the communication directed to country behind the operation.

So clearly to make agents more succesfull their coummication
is the one needing new techniques - how about internet?
It is accessible almost everywhere and you can get an 
account without giving your real identity. By using certain
sites you just call in from telephone box give few information
or in some places none and you are ready for almost 
totally untraceable communication. I bet they are using
it already a lot to replace clumsy readio communication.

Don't get me wrong I vote for freedom of speech(whitch is 
getting slimmer), privacy (witch there is not much left), 
no regulation on encryption (which is not going to be)
but I don't like these things used against my country's
security and steal our intellectual property.

Based on this I tend to think every self respecting 
intelligence organization must have those taps 
otherwise they are not doing their job properly.

Truman might have been one of the best presidents US ever had
but talk is talk and deeds are deeds.


Comments and reasoning is totally my own imagination 
my employer would propably disabprove them and
certainly not they don't represent my employers 
opinions.

Be carefull out there ...
