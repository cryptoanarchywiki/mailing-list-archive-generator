Thing about the Restatement (any of 'em) is that they
must be read carefully, being especially wary of
circularity.  Note here that the actor would be privileged
only to the extent he would be privileged, get it? under
some other body of law not specifically referenced.

So it all comes back to reasonable apprehension of bodily
harm to yourself or your family (or guests, I suppose), in 
your home or similar place.
