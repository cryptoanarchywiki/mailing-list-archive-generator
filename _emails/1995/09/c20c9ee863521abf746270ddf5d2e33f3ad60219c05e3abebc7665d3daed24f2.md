   "Making the PC Come Alive. A Software Language That Puts
   You in the Picture." By John Markoff

      A new computer language known as Java is an emerging
      technology that many industry experts expect to be the
      next big thing in computing. Just as popular World Wide
      Web "browser" software like Netscape has transformed the
      Web from a scientist's research tool into a consumer
      medium over the last two years, many computer industry
      researchers and executives predict that the Java
      programming language will transport the Web to the next
      level.
