That was my thinking exactly.  That's why I wrote just such a mail2news
gateway to a local newsgroup, csc.lists.cypherpunks (moderated, with
cypherpunks@toad.com as the moderator), as you can probably see in
the header.

This way, trn groups all articles with the same subject together,
and correctly threads articles that have References: or In-Reply-To:
headers.

As for the location, I'd agree with comp.security.cypherpunks.

Watch out, though; the list/group will probably get a much higher
readership as a newsgroup.  Although this is good for the
"make the public aware" goal, remember that, as far as I can tell,
September 1992 never ended.

I've been very impressed with the signal/noise ratio on this list.
In fact, people often put [NOISE] in the subject line to flag trivial
content.  This ratio will certainly go down if we go to a newsgroup.

One of the main benefits of Usenet is that anyone can _post_.
One of the main detriments is that _anyone_ can post.
