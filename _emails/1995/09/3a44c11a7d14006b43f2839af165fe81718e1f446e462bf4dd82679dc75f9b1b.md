Clever, but I think it's missing an important element of zero knowledge
interactive proof systems. For example, why not simply open _both_ hands?

By opening both hands one shows immediately that one has a duplicator, but
does not show how the duplicator works. The same results are obtained with
perfect certainty in _one_ round that the ZKIPS approach takes N rounds (as
N gets large).

Granted, this fails the " don't want the buyer to be able to prove to
anyone else that you have a duplicator" test, but I don't think that is
central to ZKIPS. I think a more important test is "don't show others how
to make matter duplicators."

Matter duplicators are "self-demonstrating" without revealing how they
work, so they don't fit the model of (or create a need for) software-based
ZKIPS.

For example, in the Hamiltonian cycle example, the Prover demonstrates to
the Skeptic either the set of nodes, with the nodes labelled, or a
Hamiltonian cycle, with the nodes unlabelled. If he shows _both_ the set of
nodes _and_ a Hamiltonian cycle, then he's given the Skeptic the whole
shebang. In Phill's example, he's just taught the Skeptic "how to make a
matter duplicator."


But I applaud the creation of new and simpler examples, and maybe I'm wrong
and Phill's example captures the essence of zero knowledge interactive
proofs. I'll think about it some more.

Comments?
