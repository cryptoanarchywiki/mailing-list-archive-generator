Here's another option.  I have no idea if it is possible, nor how it would
be implemented!  PGP could allow for an alternate secret key and a
standard "dummy" document from somewhere in your path.  A command line
option would encrypt for both keys (as if there were 2 recipients) and
append the "dummy" document to the end of the target file when encrypting. 

When the safety is finally removed from the gun at your head (sorry for
the drama) you hand over your alternate secret key.  If decrypted with the
"alternate" or "fake" secret key, the encrypted file is wiped until it
reaches a marker; the remainder of the file is displayed.  If you use your
"primary" or "real key", the extraneous text is simply stripped. 

Alternately, the "dummy" file could overwrite the "real" message n times, 
to keep the decrypted file size more realistic.

If you are forced to turn over keys some day (and I think there is at
least a reasonable likeihood of that) then They will have a much harder
time arguing "But that's not what the file *really* said and, deep inside
of me, I know it!".  At that point, with a secure wipe going on while the
"decryption" was taking place, you have done the best you could.  I agree-
a search warrent gives authorities the right to search your home (or
disk)- not a guarantee that they'll find what they're looking for.
