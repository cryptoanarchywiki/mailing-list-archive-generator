Just to let everyone know that I've got an assignment from Wired to do a
story with the above working title.

Since Wired is monthly it will be feature rather than news but will give a
bit of an inside look at the process.

I will be hitting various people up for help and would appreciate it if you
send any URLs on the SSL and other such cracks to me.
