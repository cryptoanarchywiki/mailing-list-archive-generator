Obviously, but I think many people would resist it if they collect it just
for the sake of collecting it.  But if they say they are collecting it to
put on the license in order to verify licenses "in the field", then the
collection will be a lot more palatable to a lot more people.

Have people in CA complained much that they collect it when you get the
license?
