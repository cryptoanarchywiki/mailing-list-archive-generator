"Printer's ink has been running a race against gunpowder these many, many
years. Ink is handicapped, in a way, because you can blow up a man with
gunpowder in half a second, while it may take twenty years to blow him up 
with a book. But the gunpowder destroys itself along with its victim, while
a book can keep on exploding for centuries."
