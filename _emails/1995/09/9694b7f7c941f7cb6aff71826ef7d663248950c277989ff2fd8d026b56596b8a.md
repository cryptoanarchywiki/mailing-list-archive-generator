  Guys, I think this has gotten a little silly. Trying to claim that 
anyone 'stole' a single word title is equivalent to Microsoft trying to 
tell other OS makers that they can't call their graphical frame things 
'windows' because they thought of it first.

  The word 'Hackers' is a description of a group of people. It means 
different things to different folks (personally I like the 
definition/descriptions in Stephen's book) but since it is so widely used 
I don't see how anyone can claim to have had it stolen from them.

  Just as a side note, Stephen's book 'Hackers' had a substantial 
influence on me when I read it, and it holds a honored place among my 
collections of books.

  Brian
