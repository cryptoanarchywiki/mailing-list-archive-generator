Hm.  Observe the bad signature from the "Cypherpunk signing agent".  Sorry if
I should have limited this to Lucky and the auto-signer, but I thought y'all
might be interested in this as either an attack or false positive.  (My bet
is on the false positive, of course.)


Bryce, signatures at end


P.S.  I have seen no kiddie porn of any type on the Net.  Oh wait, I saw some
once that advertised itself as "young girls" performing fellatio, but they
looked to be adults as far as I could tell.

P.P.S.  I wonder if a "pedaphile" would be a teacher fetishist?  And a
"pedephile"-- for feet?

There has always been nude teens on the net. The kind of pictures the most
casual observer can take at any Mediteranian beach at any given day in the
Summer. There is no real kiddy porn readily available on the net.  I
looked long and hard. Its a red herring.

ANYBODY on this list seen some real kiddy porn on the net? I am talking
intercourse, etc., not scans of six year olds from the Sears catalog, or
naked boys building sandcastles on the beach.
