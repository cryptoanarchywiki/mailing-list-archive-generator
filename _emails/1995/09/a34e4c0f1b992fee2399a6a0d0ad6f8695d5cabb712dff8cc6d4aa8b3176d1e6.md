Acutally, I have *everything* laying around all over the place but I 
suppose that's off-topic.

They have to decrypt the file sometime if they want it's "contents".

I use the -w option when encrypting.  After encryption, the "dummy" file
(would be) embedded and the plaintext is wiped.  The only "secret" key 
is the "fake" key.  The "real" key is under the blender in the kitchen.  
(If I get busted and they search under the blender I will write back if 
I'm in a position to do so.  Not that I have anything to get busted for 
of course. :)  Don't back up plaintext and what is the problem here?  
Where will they get the "real" data from?  What does it matter where the 
decryption takes place?  And no, I don't have backup tapes laying around; 
I use a Zip Drive!  :-)
