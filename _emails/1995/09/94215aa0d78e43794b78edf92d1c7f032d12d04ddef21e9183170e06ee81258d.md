There was an investigative article in a recent Readers Digest (no I'm not a
regular reader, heard it through Radio for the Print Handicapped in
Australia) regarding a major counterfieting operation that uses same printing
presses as used by US Treasury. The proceeds amount to BIG numbers and are
used to fund various terrorist organizations.
