Yes:  1.196 MHz precision.

The VTD maintains a 64-bit value that is accurate to 0.8 microseconds. This
value is obtained by calling the VTD with AX set to 0100h. The 64-bit value
is returned in EDX:EAX. The returned value indicates the time Windows has
been running based on a 1.196 MHz clock.
