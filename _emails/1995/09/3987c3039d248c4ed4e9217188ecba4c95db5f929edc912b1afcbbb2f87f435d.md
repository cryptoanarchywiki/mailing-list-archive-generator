Why would you even ask this question?  If the odds are > 0 (which they

A screensaver which shuts down the system entirely if anything but "}" is 
pressed.

If any key but the secret one is pressed by an excited agent, the ramdisk 
is gone.  If the computer is simply powered down, the ramdisk is gone.

I suggest, rather than a ramdisk however, an encrypted partition al la 
CryptDisk or Secure(Drive? Device?).
