How could crypto put lawyers out of business?  People would still
have disagreements; plans would still go wrong; cars would still
crash.  More important, transactions would still need to be 
structured to carry out the desires of the parties while minimizing
risks.

Good communications technology, including crypto, could make lawyering
more efficient, but I suspect the savings would be minimal.

Communications technology will no more put lawyers out of business
than CASE put programmers out of business.
