On the less paranoid side of this, you might check out TIS's Data Recovery
Center plans.  ftp://ftp.tis.com/pub/crypto/drc/ and below.
That location will have some code for interfacing to the prototype DRC in a
week or two.  Send me e-mail if you want to be on the mailing list for
notification of code availability/updates.


On the more paranoid side of this, in spite of Steve Walker's relish over
the fact that TIS's CKE (Commercial Key Escrow -- his name for the DRC
work) keeps keys out of government hands, except in cases of actual search
warrant, it looks (according to one privacy-advocate lawyer I discussed
this with) as if access can be gained with a mere subpoena -- and,
according to Scott Charney (of Justice Dept., if I remember correctly) the
currnet view is that if you voluntarily give a copy of your key to your
employer, you've abandoned your presumption of privacy and that relieves
the gov't of getting a search warrant (and maybe even subpoenna).
