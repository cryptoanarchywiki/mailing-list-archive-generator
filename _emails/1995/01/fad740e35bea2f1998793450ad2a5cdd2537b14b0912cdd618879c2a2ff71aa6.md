Some may recall an idea I wrote about a couple weeks ago to provide
transparent encryption/signing/remailing facilities to users of Windows 
Sockets based mail agents on PC's (e.g., Eudora).

I have completed an initial portion of the program as a "proof of
concept."  All it does right now is act as a SMTP server and accepts
mail from a mail agent, performs requested encryption/signing operations
on received messages, and puts RFC 822 compliant outbound messages in a
directory for submission to a 'real' SMTP server. (No remailing features
present).

Of course, the next module to write is the SMTP client that takes this
outbound message queue and sends it off to the actual SMTP server.

It is a bare bones app with no user interface, fault tolerance, or
configuration options, and probably only works on my machine at the
moment :)

I don't expect to make any significant progress on the program between
now and the Jan. 14 meeting, but if anyone is interested I will bring it
to the meeting and "demo" what little there is at the moment.
