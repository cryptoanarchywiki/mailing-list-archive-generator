Won't work!  You can always embed an encrypted message in what 'looks' 
like plaintext.  A trivial example: Encrypt a message with a caesar 
cypher, then build a story where the first char of each word maps to 
each subsequent char from the encrypted text.  At the cost of expanding 
the size of the message by a factor of 5 to 10 you've hidden the 
encrypted message in what looks like a letter to your mother (or a news 
story in the NY Times, etc.)  This is old technique.
