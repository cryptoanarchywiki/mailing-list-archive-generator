A classic example of people being unwilling to accept responsibility for the 
outcome of their own actions.  That said, building inspection serve much the 
same function as code reviews, and are a "good thing" for exactly the same 
reason.  I suspect that the A-E's will lobby for liability exemptions, and 
if they fail to get them, they will wind up going to private building 
inspectors/"code consultants" just like in-house accountants bring in 
outside auditors.
