Sandy posted Martha "Spam" Siegel's SF Chronicle editorial. If it boiled 
anyone's blood quite enough to write a letter to the paper on both the author's
background as well as the unconstitutionality of her 'solutions', I'd be happy
to sign my name in support.

BTW while paranoia is good for C'punks, I don't see a hidden plot in the
recent media coverage of anonymity. The media likes 'hot' issues, and have
flogged the other one - kiddie porn - to death. Everyone from Newsweek to 
The Economist mentioned pedophilia, simply because it grabs attention more
than global K-12 projects conducted over the net, just as anonymity grabs 
more attention in relation to crime than to sexual abuse recovery groups.
