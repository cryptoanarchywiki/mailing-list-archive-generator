I agree. There should be minimal cooperation between remailer operators.
They should work together on standards and policies to ensure the free flow
of messages.  They should not be afforded an oportunity to conspire.

Observation:
Most complaints to remailers come from news posts. Only a small fraction from
direct mail. (Is this the experience of the other operators?)

Suggestion:
Pay the first and last remailers in the chain.
The first remailer knows who you are. You simply
purchase an account from him. He provides support and
user friendly utilities...
Block all posts from normal remailers.
News posts only allowed from pseudonym servers like omega.c2.org.
The user uses e-cash, or greenbacks in an envelope, to buy an
account on the nym server.

All email from other remailers, and to any address is free.

Thoughts?
