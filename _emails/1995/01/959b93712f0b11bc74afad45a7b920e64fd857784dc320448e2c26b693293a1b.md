"Anti-immigration bandwagon," San Francisco Examiner, Sunday, 11/22/95, p. A-5:

Amid an article discussing Clinton's effort to beat the Republican's in
keeping out illegal aliens:

"A federal advisory commision recently proposed that the government
establish a computerized register of the names and Social Security numbers
of citizens and aliens authorized to work in the United States, so that
employers could check the immigration status of job applicants."

"Clinton will seek $8.3 million for a pilot program to evaluate the
effectiveness of such a system."

Comforting words, especially given that children are to be assigned Social
Security numbers at birth.

Best Wishes,
