To some degree this requires the evaluation of the "authority attention" 
level the data haven has achieved.  If the real sensitive data is more 
extreme than a porn deposit, (I assume we are talking 'legal' and not 
kiddie porn BTW) then the spam involved will serve to properly mask, to 
some degree, stego'd files within the porn.  Part of a data haven, it 
seems to me, will be security by obscurity.  Just on the basic level that 
a haven with all encrypted files will be somewhat secure by obscure, in 
that the authority most likely to be interested in the data probably will 
not be attentive.  A repository holding some legitimate spam, be it porn 
or gifs or whatever, is unlikely to attract the level of SERIOUS 
attention that the sensitive data it contains may warrant.

To sum:  Spam's usefullness is a function of current authority attention, 
likely authority attention and authority attention the sensitive data 
warrants.

A better policy might be to encrypt all files that are not encypted, 
perhaps through some key assignment system.  The spam thus adds to the 
total traffic analysis problem, and the security of the spam is not 
material.  i.e. better encrypted spam than plaintext spam.
