WiReD. What a waste of pulp; worse, what a waste of potential. A magazine 
that could have held the hands of aol novices and led them into the real 
net.world, and promoted freenets, and demonstrated the need for 
cryptosystems, and challenged the minds of net citizens decided to take 
the low road and become "USA Today" (for cypherpunks abroad, "USA-T" is a 
`newspaper' that looks like a big comic book, and doesn't trouble its 
readers with many syllables ... rather like Prodigy ...).
