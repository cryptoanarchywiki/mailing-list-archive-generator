I've never figured out why governments are made out to be so bad; guns, ok,
but the problems of privacy we face on this list have little to do with that.
Corporations can be at least as bad - extreme government leads to socialism,
which often retains some form of citizen-participation in decision-making;
the corporate state, though, is exemplified in fascism, inherently much less
concerned about citizen's rights.

As many of us have argued, in what is sometimes called a 'post-capitalist'
economy, (intellectual) property rights will not be enforceable. They may
be respected often - but then that requires no laws; after all no one had
tried to rob Phil Zimmerman of his (only recently trademarked) 'PGP'. Those
who depend too much on enforced rights will not survive. I've discussed in
my column, Electric Dreams, and on this list the shift in economic structure
that will have to take place - cooking-pot markets, knowledge exchanges etc;
concept patents enforced by net.cops are most certainly 'Second Wave thinking!'

'Third Wave' is such a lovely phrase that it is all too easy to hand wave 
opposing beliefs and concerns - "that's Second Wave thinking." Reminds me of 
the Freudian defense against Jung - "Ah, Jung was sexually repressed as an 
infant and therefore jealous of his mentor's open emphasis on id..." - 
solipsism is great for argument, but does little to elicit the truth.

FOL! That competition and distributed ownership is elitist has long been
held true by communists; the reason we prefer it this way is that monopolies
end up being elitist too - benefiting those within them.

Those who remember their history will note that the original Magna Carta was
not a pact that distributed power from a King to the people, but to a feudal
nobility - the rest of us, netSERF on!
