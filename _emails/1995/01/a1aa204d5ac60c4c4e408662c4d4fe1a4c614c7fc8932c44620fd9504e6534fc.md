RSA Licenses Commercial Distribution Rights to RSAREF
=====================================================
  RSA announces that it is licensing commercial distribution
  rights of its RSAREF software to Consensus Development, allowing
  for implementation of commercial Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
  applications.


Press Release
--------------
  REDWOOD SHORES, CALIFORNIA--JANUARY 9, 1995--RSA Data Security,
  Inc. and Consensus Development Corporation jointly announce today
  at the RSA Data Security Conference that Consensus Development is
  licensing the commercial distribution rights of RSAREF from RSA
  Data Security.

  RSAREF (pronounced "R.S.A. reff") is short for "RSA reference
  implementation" and is a cryptography source code toolkit designed
  to allow developers to create PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)software
  and other encryption/authentication tools. Until now, RSAREF has
  been an unsupported RSA product approved for use only as part of
  freeware and not-for-profit software applications.

  Consensus Development will now be able to market and license RSAREF
  to commercial software developers, and provide software support and
  future enhancements to the RSAREF source code library.
