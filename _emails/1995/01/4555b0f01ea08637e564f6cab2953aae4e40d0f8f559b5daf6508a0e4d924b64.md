The primary point that I'm trying to make is that there is no such thing 
as an algorithmic test for a dataset being in a 'state' of encryption.  
Such a test is beyond alogrithmic capability (at least in our universe). 
Therefore, an RM/DH operator should just drop the pretense of filtering 
out non-encyphered submissions.  Just take what comes and tell customers 
that if they don't want you to read it, it's up to _them_ to make 
certain that you can't.  Period!  The DH operator could encypher all 
submissions with his own key so that the DH contents can't be 
compromised to outsiders.  This seems to be a much more real-world 
approach to the problem than tilting at windmill with encryption 
filters.  (The previous examples were an attempt to demonstrate, in a 
concrete way, the failure of any such algorithmic approach. Whatever 
encryption-test algorithm you come up with I guarentee you I can defeat 
it!)
