I think the worst is that the government never seems to be in the mood 
for giving your computer equipment back to you. Hiding your phycal 
location, being out of the question, (old thread), all the government has 
to do is drum up suspision and enough information for a warrant for your 
computer equipment, then your screwed out of a system. If you had a 
system good enough to efectivly handle DH's or even remailers, your out 
of a good sum of money.
