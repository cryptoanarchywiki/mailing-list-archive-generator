   Let me try to deal with the first
   two to conclude that many professionally run remailers may very well
   stay free or close to that for a long time:

[summary: cross-subsidies for hiding another businesses]

Cross-subsidies are common in other industries, why not in privacy
provision?  No particular reason why that won't happen.

Nevertheless, the remailer is getting paid for one way or another.  In
addition, virtual link encryptors to some other commercial remailer
may be a better way of providing cover traffic.

It is refreshing, though, to see thoughtful discussion about alternate
economic arrangements.  The twin requirements of supporting the
physical remailer and preventing swamping do not immediately and
necessarily lead to pay-per-use.
