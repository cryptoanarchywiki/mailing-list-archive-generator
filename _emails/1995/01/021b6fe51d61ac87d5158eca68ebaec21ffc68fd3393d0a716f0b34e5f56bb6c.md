are you saying that there is an agreement between the data haven operator 
and the user?  If so, that's one of the things i was attmeting to point 
out in that reply.  I think the agreement, wether it is a contract, not 
likely, or a sense of trust is extremely important to the data-haven.

Right now were are getting into so many fraggin different definitions of 
data haven, that this conversation is loopng over itself infinetly.  In 
one sort of data Haven, the operator does have a responsibility to keep 
the data private, yet on another, he doesn't have th responsibility, it 
all depends on what the aims and views and golas of the DataHaven are.  
And since we have not yet agreed on what a data Haven.....we get usenet 
run-around.

this is ties into the above line, maybe you arent just sending encrypted 
data, maybe your selling secrets to a datahaven operator, who is 
offshore, or who has the money ot pay you know, and also the structre set up 
to recieve, transmit, and take payment and pay for that secret data, or 
valuable info.  Once again I think that we are working with multiple 
definitions of DataHaven here, adn it is leading to confusions.

ther are already services much better equipped to deal with this problem, 
although, I am unsure if any of them are crypto-aware as of yet.  Osmthig 
to look into.
