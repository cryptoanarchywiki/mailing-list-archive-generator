But certainly no worse than the stuff which regularly flows
through a.b.p.tasteless and a.b.p.bestiality.

It strikes me that this would be the perfect way to generate
consumer interest in anonymous digital cash protocols.  The
entire AA collection, hooked up to the net through a T-3, and
available for a nominal fee per GIF, could easily make the AA
Sysops millionaires by the time their sentences are over.  Such a
setup would make their pictures available to everyone, not just
the limited number of people their BBS has the capacity to
handle.

Perhaps the server could be placed securely overseas in a neutral
country which still respects privacy and free speech.  Orders could
be encrypted using the server's PGP key and the customer could 
specify the passphrase to be used to IDEA encrypt the "goods"
prior to shipment, ala NetBank.

When the government pisses into the wind, the citizens get wet.
