What if the remailer operator is not root?

I will offer to forward mail for MX records to any address via my
system (myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu).  If you want to run a remailer, and
have it be completely hidden from nameserver lookups, ask John Perry
to create an MX record for your domain which points to
myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu, and tell me the address you want it forwarded
to.  I will configure my SMTP daemon to forward all mail to your
domain to the email address your remailer is run on.

Well, to obscure the origin of your outgoing mail, you could simply
forward via another remailer.  However, delivering directly to SMTP
port 25 would probably be a good idea.  Sendmail has an option to
set the from using -f, but you have to have it configured to allow
it.  Normally only root, uucp and daemon are allowed to use this
option.
