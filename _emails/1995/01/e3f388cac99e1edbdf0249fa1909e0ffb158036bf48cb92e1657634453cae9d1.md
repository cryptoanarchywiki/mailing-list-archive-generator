Just out of curiousity on this subject, is there any remailer software for
Macs? I think I have enough leverage and power on my campus to be able to
run a remailer here during the school months *which is when I have net
access*.  If there isn't, how hard would it be to do? Could it be done with
something like MailShare indirectly?
