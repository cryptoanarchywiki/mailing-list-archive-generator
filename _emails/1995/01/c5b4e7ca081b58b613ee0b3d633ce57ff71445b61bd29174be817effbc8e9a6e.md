Do you have any sort of life whatsoever, James?  Writing a gazillion K
of flamage on your hot-button topic du jour, especially when you keep
lying about wanting to end the thread, is a total waste of your time,
esp. if you believe people will read the spew.

(I'm half believing that you're going to call me a collectivist because
 I imply that one writes so that others will read).

I've simply never heard of anybody caring.
