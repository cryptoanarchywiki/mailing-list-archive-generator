True enough.

The big problem I have with mandatory encryption for remailers is that it 
thwarts one of the two major purposes of remailers.  Basically I see 
remailers serving two goals:

        1)  Defeating traffic analysis of point-to-point communications.
            Mandating encryption for this is redundant--anyone who wanted this
            would be encrypting their mail to begin with.  Also, I don't     
               believe this mode of operation generates many complaints.

        2)  Anonymous broadcast transmission.  This one can generate a lot of
            complaints, but it is also very important for things like *.recovery
            newsgroups.  Mandating encryption renders this mode useless.

There is a third use, which is anonymous point-to-point transmission.  While 
this is of some benefit for anonymous tip line, it makes things like 
mailbombs and hate mail very easy.
