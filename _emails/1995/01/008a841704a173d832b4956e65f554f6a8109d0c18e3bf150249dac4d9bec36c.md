Today's (1/31) Washington Post has a tiny blurb that AT&T and VLSI will
announce a hardware encryption device for use in lots of
communications devices, including cell phones, PDAs, etc.

Today's Wall Street Journal has a bit more, says that it uses
3-DES and is a market rejection of Clipper. Also contains a quote
from Jim Bidzos of RSA/PKP. But there is little detail. There
was no mention of what PKP technology is used in the hardware.
I assume that AT&T has liscensed DH for session key exchange.
They could be using RSA with the keys embedded in ROM/EEPROM.

Anyone got any technical details?

Thanks
Pat
