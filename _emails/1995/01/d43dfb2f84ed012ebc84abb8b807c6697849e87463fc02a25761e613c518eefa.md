If the encryption method is any good, the output will be pseudo-random
with no digit being more frequent than any other. This certainly applies
to IDEA and DES. With RSA, you usually have a random (IDEA) session key
encrypted using the senders private key. This will also be an effectively
'random' number.

This would only work for ciphers that are effectively 'broken'. Also, many
packages and users compress data before encryption. Compression algorithms
work by removing patterns from data, so the resultant compressed plaintext
becomes fairly random anyway, removing the utility of frequency analysis.
