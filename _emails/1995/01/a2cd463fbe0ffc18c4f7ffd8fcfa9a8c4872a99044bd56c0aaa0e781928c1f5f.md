I've got one of those, too (it won't be ready for release too soon, 
though - telnet is big and ugly).  An encrypting telnet and telnetd
almost always provide a more appropriate way to do session encryption.
However, there are some situations where ESM is really the only
option.  One is when you can't or don't want to install a daemon
(e.g., for very occasional use).  More importantly, by running within
the session, ESM can provide end-to-end encryption across an untrusted
application-layer firewall (like the one I go through to get
between home and work).

Since part of my motivation for working on these tools comes from 
wanting to use them myself, I'm building the stuff I need the most
first.
