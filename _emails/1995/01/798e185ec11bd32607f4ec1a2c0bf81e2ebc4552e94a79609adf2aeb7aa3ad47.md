I wasn't referring to requiring encryption using the remailer's public key.  
I was referring to the stuff discussed here, where the remailer operator 
insists on ensuring that the traffic is encrypted over and beyond the 
remailer's public key, in order to give the operator plausable deniability.

Really, all inbound remailer traffic should be encrypted with the remailer's 
public key if any significant level of security is desired.
