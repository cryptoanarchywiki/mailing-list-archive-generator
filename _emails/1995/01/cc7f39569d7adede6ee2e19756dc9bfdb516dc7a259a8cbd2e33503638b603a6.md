I don't think it's useful to redefine "anonymous" to include some 
messages which identify the author, and to exclude some messages which
do not identify the author. Then again, I'm not sure it's useful to
play Language Cop, either. But count mine as a voice in favor of
describing accurately what's being discussed. (Perhaps messages which
defy traffic analysis might be called "untraceable" but not 
"anonymous", unless they also do not identify an author.)

I agree. I fear I've been influenced by some of the authors on that
Cypher[something] list who've recently argued persausively in favor
of applying technology appropriate to local conditions; e.g., not
wasting time on the techno-gadget-of-the-month when more pedestrian
but functional means are available.
