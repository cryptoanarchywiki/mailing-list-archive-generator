DONT READ THIS UNLESS YOU GIVE A DAMN ABOUT JAMES DONALD'S "OPINION"
OF UNIX -- HIT DELETE NOW.

Nope, sorry.

Posix defines these things called "Locales". They provide automatic
and seamless support for things like changing currency symbols, date
formats, fonts, etc. The X windows system has full support for
internationalization in most of its widget sets, too.

Sorry that you don't work with people who know about these things, but
ignorance is not equivalent to absence.

Frankly, I have yet to see a single statement from you that actually
bore some relationship to reality. The most devistating comment you
seem to be able to come up with about why Unix is bad is that make --
an application that doesn't even come with DOS -- used to have some
places where it required tabs.
