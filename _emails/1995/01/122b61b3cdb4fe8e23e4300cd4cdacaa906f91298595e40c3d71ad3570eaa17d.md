Yeah, that does seem possible.
One thing to keep in mind, though, is that it's really the _last_ remailer
in the chain that's taking the most heat, and it would be nice if they got
payed.  There's also an issue of some remailers refusing to be last in the
chain, so they dont' expose themselves so much. So the remailers which
_did_ agree to be last in the chain would obviously get used for this
purpose, while the others wouldn't, but they wouldn't get any more money
for it. They might even get less, since most people probably don't use the
same remailer twice in a chain, so the ones agreeing to be last are hardly
ever going to be first.   That seems undesirable.

Ideally, the forces of capitalism would work on the last remailer on the
chain, rather then (or in addition to) the first, to increase the number of
remailers willing to do this.  All this goes triple for mail-to-news
remailers, since that poses even more exposure to heat, and it would be
nice if ops were conpensated for.
