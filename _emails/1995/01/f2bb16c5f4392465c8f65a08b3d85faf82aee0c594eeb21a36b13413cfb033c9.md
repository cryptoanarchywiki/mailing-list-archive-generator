If you read my analysis with more care, you will note that I do not argue
that
latency is superior to reordering, nor that it should be used in place of
reordering.  Reordering is far superior to latency. My point is that pure
reordering is vulnerable to attack. It is less vulnerable if combined with
latency.

Also note that this was a repost of a message I sent to the list some
months
ago. I sent it because it seemed similar to the work that Wei Dai has been
posting.
