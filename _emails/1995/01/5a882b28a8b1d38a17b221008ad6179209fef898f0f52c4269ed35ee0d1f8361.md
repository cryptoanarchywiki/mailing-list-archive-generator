This was essentially my point, phrased much more precisely.

I believe this has been suggested, even discussed at length before on the 
list.

Just from a structure standpoint, the haven could segment the data, 
use some sort of encryption, and then send an encrypted message 
containing the "resegmenting key."

Theoretically the haven would destroy the resegmenting key after 
generating it and sending it, leaving the original sender with the only 
copy.

Trust in the data haven operator is bolstered by his or her interest in 
not knowing the contents of the data, or the retrevial key for the data, 
less he or she be vulnerable to authority scrutiny.
