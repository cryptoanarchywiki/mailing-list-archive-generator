A small advisory: since na166182@anon.penet.fi is subscribed to the c'punks
list, and anon.penet.fi attempts to filter out instances of Make Money Fast,
any mention of "MAKE.MONEY.FAST" on the list will likely generate an autoreply
like the one below. It appears that a copy of the MAKE.MONEY.FAST FAQ (there,
I've said it again :) included in the autoreply will even trigger this 
mechanism, which is awfully ironic at best. At worst, this self-referential
property seems liable to allow some nasty email feedback loops. Offhand it
appears that a message with an address @anon.penet.fi (preferably forged) in
the From: line, and "MAKE.MONEY.FAST" as the message body, would launch an
automatic recursive bounce process as anon.penet.fi attempts to send itself
a message it considers illegal. Presumably this would crash when the disk
quota on some mail spool somewhere is exceeded. If the message was forged
to come From: cypherpunks@toad.com or another list to which an anon.penet.fi
user is subscribed, I imagine the list would have the dubious privilege of
witnessing all the recursive bounce messages along the way.

I'm not volunteering to try to write a better MMF-recognizer for a.p.f, 
though....
