Aren't ya glad 94's over with?
He was in a big hole as 95 started.

His machine was being hacked routinely.
Nobody on the Web visited the site.

I just like PGP.
I believe it to be the nicest program anywhere.
It has lots of everyday uses, even you used it.

And when I crosspost a help note to .1% of Usenet,
and lose 4 days of good postings, everyone loses.

Till of course the story is told, for all to know.

Love Always,

Carol Anne
