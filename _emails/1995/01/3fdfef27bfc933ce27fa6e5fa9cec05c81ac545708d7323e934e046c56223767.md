- From the node of anonymous-remailer@shell.portal.com:
: 
: I want to propose that a change to more of a Snow Crash society
: with anarcho-capitalism as the norm is not necessarily being
: _caused_ by pressures listed above, but, rather, fit a grander
: historical destiny.  What we are seeing and will see in the
: 

Not necessarily to the EXTREME that Stephenson predicted, but I definitely
see alot of what he said already starting to happen.  Hell, look at the 
Burbclaves.  Lil' old Indiana, PA had their first drive-by shooting a
few months ago.  Some of the growing gang-warefare influence is starting to
spill over from Pittsburgh.  Once people get a little more frightened of
violence, the engineered community idea is going to explode.  Now take
that with private and corporate police forces and ... BINGO!  Snowcrash.

: Consider the possibility that the dissolution of large,
: centralized federal republics is also inevitable.  (The
: Frissel/Sandforth Optimists have been arguing this exact point.)
: 

The decentralizing effect of digital networks (or Webs a la Hakim Bey)
is pretty self evident.  One can easily extrapolate the effects of a
structure like the Internet, a structure that by nature routes around
any form of 'censorship' from above.
