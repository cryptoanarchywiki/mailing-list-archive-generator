To clarify a little bit:  I summarized wrongly.  The GPS fine location has
not been turned off, the dithering has been turned off.  In essence,
the GPS fine positioning usually lies in a particular algorithmic way
designed to make determining exact locations extrememly difficult.

In theory, the military GPS units bypass this dithering.  Either it doesn't
work or there aren't enough military units (I believe the latter is the
official story), but GPS fine positioning has been turned off during times
like the Iraq massacre and the Haiti invasion so that the military can
use civilian units.

In any case, it turns out that the Green Beret in question is being sent
to Haiti.  It doesn't explain the GPS, tho.  There's lots-o-speculation
elsewhere on the net.
