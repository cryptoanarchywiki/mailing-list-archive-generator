Not quite.  It's this one:

	First they came for the communists,
	and I did not speak out, for I was not one;
	They came for the Jews,
	and I was silent because I was not a Jew;
	They came for the Trade Unionists,
	and I did not protest, because I did not belong to a trade union;
	They came for the Catholics,
	and I said nothing because I was not a Catholic;
	And then they came for me.
	There was no one left to say anything...

	Rev Martin Niemoeller, 1945
