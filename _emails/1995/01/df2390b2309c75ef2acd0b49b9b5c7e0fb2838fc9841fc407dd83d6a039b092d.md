Actually, those of us who are going should arrange to take *separate*
flights...  My reading of Matt's message said that most of the time
was spent trying to figure out what to do, and only a little time was
spent actually doing it.  If a bunch of people all take the same
flight, it will take them only a slight bit longer to process the
whole bunch of you than if one person on the flight was doing it...
