Why, we have the credentials and audits of these organizations and
individuals checked by a being of godlike wisdom far superior
to that of us ordinary mortals -- namely that god on earth,
the government.

What makes you assume that guns make people wise and virtuous?

Common sense and casual observation does not support this hypothesis.

I recommend you read the excellent book on free banking
sold by Laissez Faire:  I do not remember their web
site, but I have a pointer to them in my home page. (see sig)

It details the sorry tale of government supervision of banks --
which invariably had the effect of the state governments robbing
the banks, or protecting well connected crooks who robbed the
banks.
