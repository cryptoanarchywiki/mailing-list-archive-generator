>Governments as a whole are seen to be "bad" because they invariably undermine
the right of the individual to make choices for themselves.

Quite untrue. It's society which provides you with an environment in which
you have choices. And its government which orders that society. It's
because government has served you so well, that you have luxury to
fantasize you don't need it. You're being duped.

>The so-called "Third Wave" has nothing to do with government and everything to
do with the empowerment of the individual.  Some seem to not recognize that.

The "Third Wave" -- if you take the PFF's Magna Carta definition (and
Toffler is one of the authors) -- is a power grab by corporations to return
the world economy to status of the USA economy in the 1880's. You so-called
libertarians might like the theoretical, abstract formula of "unregulated
capital", but if you'd put down your Friedman long enough to read history,
you'd know that it was a disaster. Unregulated capitalism is incompatible
with a civilized societiy.

>This has always been the case throughout history - the forces of dark, of
disinformation, have always attempted to keep true power from the hands of
the people.

So why are you on the wrong side?

PS> If this list would like to see the full Magna Carta, or my
analysis/review of it ("Electric Dreams" sent you a few clips), please let
me know.
