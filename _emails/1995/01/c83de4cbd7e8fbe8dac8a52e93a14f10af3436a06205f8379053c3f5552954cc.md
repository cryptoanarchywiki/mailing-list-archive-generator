This works only if one assumes that the exact same message is posted using
the exact same path.  Granted, it would probably be effective for novice
spammers.

Consider a premail/chain type script and a cleartext spam message.  The
script is executed once every five minutes, say.  When it runs, it creates a
new random path through the remailers, adding encryption wrappers for each
hop.  Your spam detector would miss this one completely unless your remailer
was used as the terminal remailer for a significant number of spams.  More
significantly, the MD5 hashes of each message would be different even if the
same path were used more than once because the PGP session key would be
different (again, unless your remailer would be the terminal remailer in the
particular path that repeated).
