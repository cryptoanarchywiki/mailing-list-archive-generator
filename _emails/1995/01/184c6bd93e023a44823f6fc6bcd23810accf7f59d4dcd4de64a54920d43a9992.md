	Yes. The unfortunate culprit was <an157790@anon.penet.fi>. I sent 
him mail, non-blinded, and posted a message to Cypherpunks and to 
<cypherpunks-owner> to get it fixed. I haven't been getting them anymore, 
so I suspect somebody fixed the problem.

	A while ago, someone posted a regexp for majordomo that would 
automatically convert a <an> address to a <na> address. Does anyone have 
that lying around anywhere?
