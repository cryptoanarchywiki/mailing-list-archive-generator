All posts to cypherpunks since June '94 are available by ftp from
ftp.hks.net:/cypherpunks/nntp/cypherpunks.   They are also available
via nntp from nntp.hks.net:hks.lists.cypherpunks.

I'd be glad to put a search engine of some sort on them, either by
Web or by mailserver, if someone can suggest a reasonable way to index
the whole lot.
