so your point, basically, is that the public will settle for whatever it 
can get, and get easiest and cheapest, when it comes to software and 
operating systems in particular.  This may be the case, but there is 
certainly a growing market for internet-capable systems, and the most 
internet-friendly OS around is, of course, UNIX.  In that fact, and in 
the growing importance of having an OS that utilizes the full 
capabilities of increasing powerful personal computers, lies the future 
of UNIX.
