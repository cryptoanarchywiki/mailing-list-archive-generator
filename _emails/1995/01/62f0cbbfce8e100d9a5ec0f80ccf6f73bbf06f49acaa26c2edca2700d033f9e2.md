I hate to contribute to this silliness, but I can't let blatant errors
like this pass.  I debug reams of C++ daily on a wide variety of UNIX
platforms.  With real symbols.  With real C++ expression evaluation an
overload resolution.

(I also get to use compilers that actually come close to supporting
the language as defined by the ARM.)
