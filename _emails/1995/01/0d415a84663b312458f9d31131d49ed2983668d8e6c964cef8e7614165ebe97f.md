Expected and hardly anything to go into public dispute about.
Cypherpunks are here to circumvent the measures of various
governments by technical means. Since Joe User doesn't really
care if he can connect anonymously or not, at least not yet,
they might very well succeed in making some aspects of anonymity
'illegal'. But who cares, if anonymous agents can't be traced?
