| You seem to think that anoynimity can be separated from privacy itself.
| Anoynimity was an accidental feature of the telephone system that was
| only recently eliminated.  Now, it seems, that those who seek control
| over others have realized that it could be eliminated in other media
| as well (why not routinely fingerprint everyone, and dust all postal
| mail for fingerprints? More practically, why not earmark every transaction
| on the Reuters feed?  Or credit every article in the Economist?).  But
| even these fundamental disruptions to basic institutions are dwarfed by
| the threat to individual confidence to speak out and not fear retribution,
| in a world with so many laws that everyone is breaking one or another...

	The Economist is written anonymously becuase it prevents
"Dan Rather syndrome."
