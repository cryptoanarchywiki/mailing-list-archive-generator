Perhaps an MD5 of the password could be encrypted along with the
plaintext using the method(s) of choice.  At the decryption
phase, the password would be MD5 hashed again and the block of
bytes the size of an MD5 hash would be "decrypted" with each of
the methods... which ever one matches the original MD5 hash
would be used to decrypt the rest of the cyphertext.

This method wouldn't leave a known plaintext in the file to
attack.
