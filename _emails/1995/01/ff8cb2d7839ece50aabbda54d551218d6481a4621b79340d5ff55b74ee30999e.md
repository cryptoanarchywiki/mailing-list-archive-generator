why would you give the haven owner free run?  I mean naturally he does 
have free run with your data once he gets it, but a matter of trust, and 
encryption protects you marginally.

it matters alot too me, that's the security of the dat, what if your data 
is sem top secret plan to bomb the pentagon, and you are using the data 
haven to distibute to your band of anonymous terrorists, I am sure you 
woudln't want your data stored ona  public access Unix system, or in 
plaintext.

you casn do this a number of ways if the datahaven is turned into a data 
broker, i can pay you for good data otehr would be willing to 
buy(Blacknet anyone?) or you could pay me for access to data, or for safe 
secure storage and anon transfer of data to other users.

because it is if you want security, and also to bring in money if that is 
a motive.

well what would be thepurpose of this data haven you propose except as a 
extra storage pace for data, like if you dont have space on your own 
drive?  Your leaving out anon drop boxes, data brokering, or the data 
haven serving as a center for black markets.
