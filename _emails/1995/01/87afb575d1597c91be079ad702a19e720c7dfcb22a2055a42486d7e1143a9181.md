A general hint for finding authors' e-mail addresses: figure out where 
he/she works from the book jacket, use WHOIS to find their domain name, and 
then finger them or look at their web page to see if they have an e-mail 
directory.  (Now keep this a secret!  I don't want the internet.masses to 
find out my e-mail address when I become rich and famous! :-)

I bet Vinge has written for himself a really intelligent filter like the 
kind he describes in AFUtD.  Of course I wouldn't want to test this.

I guess this is not really related to cypherpunks, except to the general 
philosophy of making tools to protect oneself, instead of relying on the 
good will (and intelligence) of others.
