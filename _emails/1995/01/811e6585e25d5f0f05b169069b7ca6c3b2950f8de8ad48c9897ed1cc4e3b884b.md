FYI, there's been some controversy lately on the Firewalls list about Winn
Schwartau. For one thing, he apparently works as a marketer for the company
that makes the Sidewinder firewall, so this "independent consultant" bit has
been judged rather misleading by some people. Last I saw, someone was 
requesting an apology/explanation from Internet World or some such magazine
for the last paragraph above, or a reasonable facsimile.
This arose because he apparently wrote a highly favorable review of Sidewinder
for the aforementioned `zine, in which he also criticized Bellovin & Cheswick's
firewalls bible for not discussing "type enforcement" (used/implemented by 
Sidewinder).  The latter criticism has been vigorously defended by some third
parties, and I don't know enough about the subject to make any clear judgement
about it. Anyway, since he's knocking the security of something else in the
article here, I thought it appropriate to point all this out.

[Lest anyone ask me, you can join the firewalls list by sending mail to
 majordomo@greatcircle.com with "subscribe firewalls" in the body, not in the
 subject. There's a digest format (use "subscribe firewalls-digest") which I
 recommend over the standard list distribution.]
