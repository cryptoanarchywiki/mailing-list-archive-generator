   You may want to take a look at glimpse and harvest.  Here are some useful URLs 
   for them:

   http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu:1994/

   http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/

Both very good systems.  Harvest is probably overkill.  Glimpse is nice,
but I don't know if it handles mail archives (unless they are
one-file-per-message).

There used to be a WAIS index of cypherpunks on mariposa, but it doesn't
seem to work now.

WAIS indexing mail archives is pretty easy.
