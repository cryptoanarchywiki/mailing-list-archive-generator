I see C.Chung's program as one of the first vollies in a new phase of a 
TV/print media project.

Internet and talk radio emerged as political forces in the '94 
election.  If political influence by the media is a zero-sum game, as I 
believe it is, then the TV and print media must look to their own 
survival by trying to discredit or regulate their talk radio/internet 
competition.

Regards, Skip.
