It just occurred to me when reading this another method for ensuring the
"I can't tell what's in it" condition with a data haven operator.  Why not
use a secret sharing system where the contraband data is split into a number
of pieces and sent to different havens?  It could be argued that the individual
pieces are not the same as the whole, and there is absolutely no way the
operator could recover the original from a given piece (thus providing
plausible deniability.)

Using M by N secret sharing, with M < N, you build in some redundancy in case
one of the havens gets shutdown.

Ok, Eric, go ahead and blast your holes in this argument :)
