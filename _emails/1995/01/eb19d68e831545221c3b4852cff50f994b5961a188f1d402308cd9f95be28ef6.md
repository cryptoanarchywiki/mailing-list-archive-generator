TO:    THOMAS M. SMALL
       COUNSEL FOR RELIGIOUS TECHNOLOGY CENTER AND BRIDGE
       PUBLICATIONS, INC.

FROM:  Lance Cottrell
       Operator of remailer@nately and mixmaster@nately

In response to your email of January 3, 1995 requesting that I block anonymous posting to the Internet news groups alt.clearing.technology and alt.religion.scientology.

Although my remailers have always supported direct posting to news groups, this feature has never been advertised or supported. Since direct posting from my remailers is never used, I am willing to comply with your request. Posting to alt.clearing.technology and alt.religion.scientology has been blocked.

By this action I do not admit to any wrongdoing on my part, nor do I wish to imply any wrongdoing on the part of any users of my remailers. I am merely turning of a feature that I never intended to be used.

By design it is not possible to prevent users from using my remailers to send a message to another computer to be posted. I can not, and will not, block mail to other remailers or to mail-to-news gateways.

                                Yours,
                                        Lance M. Cottrell
