Latency (by which I take to mean some kind of random delay) will 
probably make the analyst's job harder, but I suspect not by much.  The 
method of analysis I outlined earlier can be modified to apply to mixes 
that use random delay instead of batching as the method of mixing.  
Instead of adding up the number of times Alice's message to the mix is 
followed up by a message from the mix to a user, take the sum of the 
probabilities that each message the user receives is from Alice.

So you would do something like this for each user of the mix:
	  message #    probability this message came from Alice
		1                       0.000135
		2                       0
		3                       0.000012
		4                       0.004332

		     SUM:               0.004479

Each probability can be calculated from the statistical distribution of 
the delay time, the length of time between the Alice sending the last 
message to the mix and the user receiving a message from the mix, and 
the timing and number of other messages sent by the mix around this 
period of time.

This method is more general than the one I talked about earlier, since 
it is equivelent to the former method when you apply it to a batching 
mix (that is, the original Chaumian mix).
