Not actually true. It was because US banks were
subject to statutory limits on the amount of interest
they could pay on dollar deposits.

Banks are intrinsically insecure. All banks are subject to
the "sawn-off shotgun" attack, also the "kidnap the
managers family" attack and several others.

Why do you think that? Certainly it's compartmentalism
is better than UNIX, and as a "ground-up" design it's
probably seen better QA than UNIX. However, it hasn't had
20 years of interest from hackers and others. Also, while
the NT kernel may be *better*, several subsystems have
all the problems of UNIX, e.g. TCP/IP and the sequence
number attack.

I like NT, but it will never be a security panacea.
