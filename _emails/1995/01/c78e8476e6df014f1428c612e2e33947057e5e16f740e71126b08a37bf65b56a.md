What you define as pornography doesn't mean shit, it's what the media and 
jornalists and fundies etc.. decide is pornographic that you gotta watch 
out for.  This means just about anythign that isn't vanilla After School 
Special material is suspect.  

I too mayt have a site int eh near future, so I am interested int eh 
project also, as I have always been really into the idea of data-havens. 
I think that a self-sufficient data-haven is going to need alot of 
resources tho to continue it's operation past the pont were it is known 
to exist.

i want to know everything          http://www.mcs.com/~nesta/home.html
