How would you get access to the trunks?  Aren't they mostly optic 
fibers now?  Also, since Internet traffic is growing at a geometric 
rate, the probability of anyone or any organization having the 
capacity to monitor and process ALL of Internet traffic should be 
very small and decreasing.  It would be much easier to install 
sniffers on selected local networks (e.g., those containing 
remailers or other entities you're interested in).
