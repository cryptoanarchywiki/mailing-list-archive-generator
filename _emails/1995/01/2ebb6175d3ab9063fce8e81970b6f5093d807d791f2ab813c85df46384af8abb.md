I think you've grasped the fundementals!  You'll soon make VP of 
Marketing. <g>

OS/2 comes internet-ready and pre-installed and it's still an almost 
complete failure in the market.

In any mature market, technical superiority above some baseline level of 
sufficiency has no market value.  The auto market is a classic example 
of this. Look how long tail-fins and chrome have dominated technical 
superiority as the prime focus of marketing.  These are all marketing 
issues not technical issues!
