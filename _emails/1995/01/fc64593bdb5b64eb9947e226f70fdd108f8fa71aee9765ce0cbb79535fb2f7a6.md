Girl Scout Cookies do crumble a bit when crammed through the net,
and it's tough to deliver them to anonymous locations, unlike bits.
And there are moral concerns there as well - not only do their 
"butter cookies" use non-butter shortening (:-), but there's the
problem that it turns the Girl Scouts into a crass commercial enterprise,
just another division of Nabisco, instead of teaching the kids that
hard work will get them a 7 percent margin on their sales.

On the other hand, being able to have Girl Scout cookies or flowers
sent by anonymous donors may go over well in some circles...
