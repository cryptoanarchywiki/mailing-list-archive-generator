This doesn't really sound too difficult.  Just have a script run as
user uucp which adds the header and hands the message to sendmail.

Yes, this can be done, but getting IP addresses isn't easy for most
people.  I would propose that we use the unassigned IP address blocks
which are reserved for private networks (see RFC 1597).  In fact,
we could even connect the remailer systems that use the private address
space via IP tunneling (swIPe maybe?  or SLIP over telnet?)  These
remailer hosts could then communicate with each other on a private
network, and gateway mail to the internet via "firewall" hosts.  This
approach would also allow us to connect private machines to the
remailer network by providing IP connectivity to hosts which currently
use software such as Term or TIA.  Having more remailers on private
machines would be a good thing IMHO.  Finally, such a network might
serve as a basis for building future untracable/anonymous IP routing
capability.

I wonder if the "Term" program could be modified to act as a virtual
machine?  For those not familiar with the program, it creates a unix
domain socket and supplies IP services via it, forwarding them over
a modem connection.  Many programs have been modified to work with
it.  Perhaps term could be modified to send its output to an IP
interface instead.  Each user on the system can run his own term
process and have his own virtual machine.
