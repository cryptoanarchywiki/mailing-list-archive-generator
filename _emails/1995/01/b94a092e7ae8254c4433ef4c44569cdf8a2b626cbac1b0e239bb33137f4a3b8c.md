I just looked over an article in US News and World Report today.  The cover
was a badge with the words "Cyber Cops" on it.  Guess which article I
scanned.
 
"Is Anything Safe in Cyberspace?"
 
I think it came over okay.  Quoted Chaum, mentioned the positive uses of
remailers, had an extensive sections on privacy and on free speech.  It
was somewhat sympathetic to Clipper, didn't really take the protests
seriously.  Mentioned anonymous ecash.  It also had a quote skewering the
highway metiphore, "It's organic".
 
This was all after the four horsemen were trotted out, in all their glory.
If anyone looked at only the first six inches, it sounded like an attack on
the net as a whole.
 
I'ld give it a 4 on an objective scale, 7 compared to what we expect.
