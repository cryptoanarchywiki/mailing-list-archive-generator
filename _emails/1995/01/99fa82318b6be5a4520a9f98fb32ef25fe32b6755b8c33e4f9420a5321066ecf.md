The more the merrier, in my opinion. As long as they can all get funding,
which admittedly could be a problem, but presumably if it is then some of
the organizations will just drop out. *shrug*  But in general,
decentralization is good, right?  I'd rather have 5 organizations defending
electronic rights then just one, when we know all too well how possible it
is for that just one to negotiate a compromise that seems more like a
betrayal.  The more active, funded organizations, the more it appears to
legislators like people are really concerned about this stuff, and the
safer we are against point-failure.  Decentralize, distribute, good.  :)

[Of course it remains to be seen if so many organizations at once can
remain active and well funded.]
