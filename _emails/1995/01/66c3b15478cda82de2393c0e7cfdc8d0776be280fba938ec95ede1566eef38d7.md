Do you assume privacy and protection from arbitrary power are solely
libertarian concerns?  If so, educate yourself and check out the ACLU
and Amnesty International ...
..................................................

You can check out each group, each organization, each institution, etc. 
one by one, and eventually arrive at the realization that it's a matter 
of principle.    Anyone can make your life hell, even the "good guys" 
who are supposed to know better and whose talents are engaged 
supposedly for the support of great ideals.
