Ok....I thought it was more generic than that.

To mount an attack on an opponent requires specific programs oriented
toward the cypher in question. Can anyone suggest what programs / tools
may be out there for cypher busting?

I'm just curious....and no, I'm not planning on reading my girlfirend's
mail :>. I'm just interested in the methods exist in the real world. Hell, I'd
even be interested in a program to bust Enigma. That would give a basic example
or idea of how codebreakers operate on a day to day basis.
