"Relatively easy"  -- Relative to the usual venomous Unix 
user hostile interface that is.   I use procmail, but my 
local Unix guru does not, even though he has a clear need to do so.

The .procmailrc file is in effect a program, rather than
a bunch of flags.

Every time procmail receives a message it interpretively 
executes this program, which does a pattern match on the mail, if
it gets a match, passes the mail to some external program,
which may be yet another invocation of procmail executing
a different .rc file.

Now if us windows folk had done it, we would have done
it as visual basic controls and we would have created
an installation program.  Still I must 
confess, we windows folk have not done it and the unix folk have
done it, so I guess it is score 1 for unix, 0 for
windows.

But I guarantee the chairman of the board is not going
to use procmail.
