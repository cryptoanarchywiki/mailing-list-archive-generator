I suppose you _are_ aware that the US has threatened China with punitive
duties on $100 BILLION dollars worth of trade, and that China has started
holding some show trials (without shutting down its state-owned CD-piracy
factories). It's not going to be easy to find a country more willing and
able to ignore international copyright law (Berne Convention etc) than China;
however, despite howls of protest even China is likely to knuckle down 
eventually. What may be likely is distributed piracy markets, such as 
described in Tim's BlackNet spoof.
