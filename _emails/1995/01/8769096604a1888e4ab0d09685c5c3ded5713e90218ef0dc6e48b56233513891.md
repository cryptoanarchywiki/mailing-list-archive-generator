If there is no cost associated with the haven and there are no account
limitations (ie anyone can get an account) then I don't see a means to do
it reliably. However, if you work up a fee based scheme such that you 
charge per M then it is trivial. If the data is larger than the account
balance it bounces. By limiting the availability of accounts you can make
it less enticeing for users to spam the haven because they are hurting
themselves. And it is assumed that since the accounts are limited  that 
there is an assumed web of trust working.

It seems to me that a message should come back only if there is a problem.

This form of dating files is pretty commen in bbs systems where if a user
doesn't log in for say 30 days the account and its contents are deleted.
To do this doesn't even require knowing anything about the user  other than
how long the files have been there versus how long they are supposed to be
there.
