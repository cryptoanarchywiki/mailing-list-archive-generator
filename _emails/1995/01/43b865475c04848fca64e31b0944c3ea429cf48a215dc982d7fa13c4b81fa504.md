I address this somewhat further in a response to Eric Hughes on the list.
Basically, Dave wants to make sure that he can't see what's in the file. My
scheme guarantees that the file is unreadable to anybody but the owner
until the owner asks for it back. If return of the file is automated,
Dave'll never know what's in it. Alice should, of course, further protect
her data if she feels the need.

Change the payment structure a little and you don't have those worries.
Alice doesn't pay for thirty day storage, but rather pays for at least
thirty day storage. If she thinks she'll be getting the file back in
fifteen days, she only pays for that long. If she needs it for longer than
that, she sends another payment before the file expires.

That's the job of a data broker, not a data haven. Dave might well wish to
offer that service, too, but, if I were him, I'd keep the two obviously
separate.

Not without an awfully good AI....
