Do you assume privacy and protection from arbitrary power are solely 
libertarian concerns?  If so, educate yourself and check out the ACLU 
and Amnesty International ...

I even know lots of cyrpto-anarcho-libbers [or whatever Tim May is 
calling them nowadays ;-] who are willing to concede, under pressure, 
that unfettered corporations can be as dangerous to freedom as any 
government.

So encrypt away, guys, and I'll keep telling *my* compatriots that no, 
"the modem in Washington" didn't rig all the vote-counting computers 
in the last election.  I'm relying on you-all to keep it that way, 
while others try to make/keep voting meaningful.  It's called 
division of labor ...

Greens, of course, only enslave plants - so weed-whackers work better than cops ...
