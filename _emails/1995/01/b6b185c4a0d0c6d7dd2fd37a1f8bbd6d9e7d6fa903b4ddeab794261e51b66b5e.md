	There are two versions of MacPGP that use RSAREF, and are thus
legal & kosher, plus Viacrypts.  The free ones are MIT, and 2.6.2ca.
The MIT one doesn't support Apple Events.  The Apple event supporting
PGP's can be driven by a menu interface called the MacPGP kit. 2.3 is
not fully compatible with 2.6; I use 2.6.2 with the kit.

	You were supposed to use gunzip (GNU's unzip) to unzip, but
Stufit deluxe will handle it; just tell Stuffit its a zipped file.

Crunch asked:

| I learn that Mac PGP2.3 exists,  but NO version 2.6
| exists for the Mac.   Is that true?    If not,  then
| where can I get a copy,  so I can decode a message
| created with 2.6?    If ver 2.3 will decode a message
| encoded with 2.6,  then I'm faced with how I can
| extract this Mac file which has a .gz extension.
| Binhex don't seem to decode it.  So,  I now got this
| file named "macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx.gz" on my Mac.    Was
| I supposed to have used some special UNIX itility to
| convert the .gz thingie first?    Please emlighten
| this confused cypherpunker!!! :-)   Or will I even have
| to do all of this because 2.3 is incompatable with 2.6.
