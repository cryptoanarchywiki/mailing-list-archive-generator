Although DH and RSA are believed to be of approximately equal
difficulty given the same number of bits, DH is additionally
vulnerable because system designers usually publish an "official"
modulus and primitive root for everyone to use, whereas in RSA,
everyone has their own key.

To mount an attack on PGP, for instance, you must factor a key
for each person whose privacy you wish to compromise.  Breaking
Sun's published 192 bit DH modulus instantly broke SunRPC on all
machines using the protocol.  The latter was a lot less work than 
the former.
