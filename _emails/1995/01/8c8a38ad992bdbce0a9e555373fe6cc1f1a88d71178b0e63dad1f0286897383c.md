To solve problem #1, use digital postage of some form. Digicash, FV,
Tacky Tokens, Mountain Dew futures... just require a per-storage-unit
charge _to initially check in the file_. You can of course charge for
storage over time, too.

To solve problem #2, send an MD5 hash of the file back to the sender.
Ideally, you would also provide (in perl, C source, csh, or whatever)
a submission script which outputs an MD5 hash before the file is sent.
As long as the before-sending hash matches the hash returned by the
haven, you can assume that the file is intact.

Not very. Use a dbm database to map "rent due" dates by file, then
periodically sweep through the database.

Perl has the nice property of being fairly portable, too.
