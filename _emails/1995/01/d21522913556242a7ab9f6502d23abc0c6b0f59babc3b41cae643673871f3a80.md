Yes, my machine has a 56k direct line in, 24 hrs. a day, 7 days a week
(during school months!;-)) The server you just mailed to is on this
machine.

I understand this, and am trying my best to cope. I am currently in the
process of developing a name server for the Mac, because the Mac has alot
against it when it comes to being a real eintity on the 'Net.

I agree that the Mac lacks some of the more powerful Unix features, namely
preemtive multitasking, but I also believe that, at least with the newer
Macs, CPU time-sharing is more efficient than it used to be. Know of Chuck
Shotton's MacHTTP WWW server for the Mac? An excelent piece of software
that gives literally on demand, and at least with my copy, it is always in
the background. Really about the only thing that cuts out CPU timesharing
is multimedia, mostly 3D grahpis games and highly intense graphics
software, neither of which I use (much!;-))

I thought that it was in Perl. I have tried pulling Unix Perl scripts and
running them under MacPerl, but it doesn't quite do it. In fact, it usually
doesn't do anything but spew errors back at you.

As I noted, I have a constant 56k line in/ out. And mine never moves...
it's a bit large... mine is a Quadra 660av (ugh).

As far as I can tell, and maybe you have other knowedge on this, my
situation should work, assuming I can run the software. What do you think?
Should the remailer Perl script run under MacPerl?
