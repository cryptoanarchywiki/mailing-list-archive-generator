If you can convince BankAmerica or MasterCard International to deal with you.

Right there you imply one of the requirements you'd need to fulfill--the 
reporting requirements on cash transactions over $10K.  If you accepted many 
deposits over $5K, you probably get asked a lot of questions about how 
you're preventing people from structuring transactions to avoid the 
reporting requirement.
