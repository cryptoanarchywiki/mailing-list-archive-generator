Sorry about that.
The hazards of being brief, I guess (never post when you're half asleep). 
Gopher and ftp work for the same address on this one.  
/Library/Documents/taz.txt is good for ftp, or try the   
/Electronic Books at Wiretap     heading on the first menu, if you use 
gopher. The pointers to the other etext sites might lead you to his other
stuff (there were two others as far as I can remember).
