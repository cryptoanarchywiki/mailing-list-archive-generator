I predicted a while back, that when the time came for a serious
attack by authority types on anonymous remailers, we would see
the term "message laundering" suddenly spring into the public
lexicon.

Well, I certainly wouldn't post death threats through Penet. At
the very least, it would threaten the existance of the server,
which is a valuable net.resource, and cause me to receive nasty
mail from Julf.  I think Bitch Siegel exaggerates the potential
danger of this particular system.
