I have been lurking for a while, trying to learn.

Someone asked about electromagnetic shielding.  I remembered an
article in Popular Science.  It was July 1989 on p. 87.  It
described a _fabric_ which provided 100 dB of shielding.  I
have not used it, but thought I would pass on the reference.
It is called Saf'n'Shielded and is produced by International
Paper.  Hope this helps.
