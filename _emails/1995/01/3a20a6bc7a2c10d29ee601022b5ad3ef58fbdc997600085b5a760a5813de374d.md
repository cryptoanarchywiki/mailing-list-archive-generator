With non-government reptutation and certification agencies. Currently the
government is saying 'there shall be one certification agency and it shall
be us', whereas personally if I were hiring someone to design a skyscraper
or cut me open I'd much prefer to pick someone who had a good rating from
three or four independent agencies. 

The only difference is that you would have the choice of choosing someone
cheap who didn't have a good reputation, not that we'd give up on them
altogether (see the numerous past discussions of reputations etc on the 
list, and the Cyphernomicon).

Another thing to consider is that the government monopoly has a lot less
to lose by certifying people incorrectly than a commercial agency would.
The government's reputation is low enough already that such errors won't
affect it significantly, whereas a commercial agency would lose a lot of
custom to its competitors.
