So why not just implement remailers for the DOS/OS/2/Windows NT crowd?  
I think we'd see more remailers if people didn't need to leave their OS 
of choice just to run UNIX and a remailer.  OS/2 and Windows NT are 
stable platforms.  If there was little performance impact caused by an 
OS/2 remailer process, I'd be more than willing to let it run.
	Is anyone working on porting remailer code to one of the 
IBM/Microsoft operating systems?  Perhaps I'll get cracking on an OS/2 
version....
