Warning! This has nothing to do with cryptography, nothing to do with
Cypherpunks, nothing to do with this list. Therefore. I'm going to
write several message about, each one saying it'll be my last word on
the subject. And, my "DON'T READ!" will hopefully pull in the curious
and encourage them to add their two francs, whhich will give me more
opportunity to expound further.

Actually, I'm lying. I'm leaving for Monte Carlo in a few hours, to
give the paper I distributed earlier. (And I'm carrying half a dozen
DATs, each capable of holding several gigabytes of data, or hundreds
of megabytes in Stego-LSB mode. And an optical disk cartridge (holding
only a measly 128 MB). I'll let you know if French customs raises an
eyebrow upon my entry to Paris--I doubt it--or if the U.S. Federales
take note of me upon my (attempted?) return to the land of the free.)

Have a good time on your Unix flame wars...but hasn't it been done
already?

I was fortunate to be in Miami last October for the apparently
interminable "logo" debate (rosy leaves on a field of cypherpunk
azure, with crossed keys triumphant), so I hope to miss this Unix vs.
DOS vs. AmigaOS vs. Warp debate. Warped, indeed.

Have fun!
