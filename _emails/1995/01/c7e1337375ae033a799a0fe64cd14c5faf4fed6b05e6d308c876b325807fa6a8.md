This gives me an idea.  Imagine a server that allows you to open a 
low bandwidth (let's say around 100 cps, in order to reduce costs)
link-encrypted telnet session with it, and provides you with a number 
of services, for example a link-encrypted talk session with another 
user.  You'll need to maintain the link 24 hours a day to defend 
against statistical analysis, and of course you can chain a number of 
these servers together in a way similiar to chaining remailers.

This scheme seems to provide untracibility while getting around the 
latency cost problem of remailers, thus allowing users to talk to each 
other in real time, anonymously.
