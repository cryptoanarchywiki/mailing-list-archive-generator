For the moment, all of the archives that Eric just dropped me are on
ftp://ftp.hks.net/cypherpunks/All

I'll be making some primitive engines to access individual articles by
various means but I thought I'd put 'em up in case anybody else with more
disk space than brains would like to snarf 'em (following the Shulgin
model).

(By the way, Glimpse looks like it'll be ideal, since everything is
 already in its own file, the "since June" archive currently being
 our /usr/spool/news/... dir.)

Look for more info in this space (that sucking sound is my copious
free time).
