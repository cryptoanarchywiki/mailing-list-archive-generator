This has nothing to do with Unix, Mr. Donald. This has to do with the
nature of internet protocols.

Can't be done. Sorry. There are certain flaws in the design of the
internet protocols down on the transport layer that I'd rather not get
into because they don't seem to be widely known and I'm not interested
in making them better known.

Sendmail already has such limits. Unfortunately they ultimately do no
good. I'd try explaining, but the details get too technical -- if
people insist I'll get into it. The gist is, however, that in the
current network its too easy to fake connections. Even with per client
limits I could still make your machine die a horrible death.

Not usually, actually. The "utilities" have nothing to do with the
kernel, and the kernel is what can crash the machine.

Those sorts of security problems are not only well known but largely
gone. The last one, in sendmail's debug flag, could only hurt a
machine by action of a user on the machine itself, not over the
network. The sorts of things I'm talking about are *inherent* in the
design of TCP and cannot be altered at this point.

Name one, Mr. Donald. Name a single one.

Sorry, but you just don't know what you are talking about here,
period. We don't know how to solve the routing problem in the general
case. Thats one of the reasons for all the arguments in the IETF
concerning the problems we are getting ourselves into with route
agregation.

(Just so you are clear here, Mr. Donald, the routing problem is NOT
the problem of finding an optimal path between all pairs of nodes on a
network in polynomial time -- thats solved and absolutely useless.)

Nope, not a bug. There are problems that we don't know how to
solve.

The problem is routing agregation, you understand, and the fact that
agregated clouds don't really experience locality of reference. This
means that we end up with nasty and totally artificial network choke
points as the networks scale. If we transmit full information,
however, we no longer get agregation and can no longer store the
tables because they are too big.
