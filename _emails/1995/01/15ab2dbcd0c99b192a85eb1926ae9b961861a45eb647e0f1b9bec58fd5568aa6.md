Well, Yale Law School is offering a class this semester on Law in 
Cyberspace.  I'm going to audit it, and when I get a syllabus(tomorrow), 
I'll post a copy if folks are intersted.

Just thought it would be of general interest.

"By the end of 1648 all was over.  Cromwell was Dictator.  The Royalists 
were crushed; Parliament was a tool;  the Constitution was a figment; the 
Scots rebuffed, the Welsh back in their mountains; the Fleet was 
reorganised, London overawed.  King Charles, at Carisbrooke Castle, where 
the donkey treads the water wheel, was left to pay the bill.  It was mortal."
