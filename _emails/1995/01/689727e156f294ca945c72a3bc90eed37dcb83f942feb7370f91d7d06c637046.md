May I ask why you even bother re-booting?  I never re-boot my machine
unless there is a problem.  I can go for MONTHS without re-booting.  I
have never used a DOS/Windows machine that could go more than a few
days without having to be re-booted.

My machine, if gracefully shutdown, boots in about 2 minutes.  DOS, I
think, would take about 30 seconds.  About 25 seconds of both of those
is POST (Power On Self-Test).
