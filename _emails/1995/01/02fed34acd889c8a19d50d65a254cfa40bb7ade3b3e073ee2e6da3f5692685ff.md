Here comes the clergy! :-)

I'm sure that when your hypothetical remailer comes up and I decide to spam
you with your own words (now I wouldn't do that, now would I? ;-), your
sysadmin will be comforted by knowing that it's only ones and zeros filling
his hard disk.  He would be especially comforted if I spammed
postmaster@wherever.you.are rather than your own account in a move to
protect your own anonymity.

Advocating a remailer such as you describe is only possible in a world where
anonymity is considered the supreme good, a goal to achieve no matter how
many other ethical rules we break.  In the real world, however, there will
always be problems with "acceptable use" and "abuse", along with the
additional problems with establishing policy and so on.
