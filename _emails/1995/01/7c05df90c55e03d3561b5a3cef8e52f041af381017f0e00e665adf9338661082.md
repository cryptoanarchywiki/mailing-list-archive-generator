To a former employer of mine, security meant using the word "security"
in as many reports as they could.  The management never committed
resources to it, and didn't seem to have a grasp of even the most
basic concepts of it, but as long as they said "security" lots of
times, they felt that they had it.

Unfortunately, this seems to be a fairly typical state of affairs
in many organisations.
