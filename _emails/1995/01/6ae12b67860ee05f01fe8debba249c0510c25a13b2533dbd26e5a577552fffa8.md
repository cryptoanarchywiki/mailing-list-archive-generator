As Wei Dai pointed out, the hostname of Vernor Vinge's office
workstation at San Diego State University can be easily determined in
about 5 minutes of poking about.  (He appears to have about 10-15
shells running at any given time...)

I really enjoy his work.  However, I've never sent him any email.
The general impression I've gotten is that he prefers not to receive
fan email, since it distracts him from important work.

If you *really* want to send him fan mail, I recommend sending it in
paper form to his publisher.  First, this allows him to better handle
fan mail in batches.  Second, this gives his publisher some indication
of interest in his work, and maybe gets him a better deal on his next
book.
