How to buy an Out of Print Book (c) 1995 Offshore Enterprises

1)  Find an OP book search specialist
2)  Ask he/she to find it for you
3)  Pay for it

To accomplish 1), ask at (independent) bookstores in your vicinity (those
are places you may have seen around town full of processed tree carcasses),
libraries, etc.
