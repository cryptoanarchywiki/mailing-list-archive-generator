That would be a little more secure, but I'm thinking that the "handful of
plaintext" would be a random number of some kind that the user prepends to
the file before encrypting. This is kinder on the data haven's CPU; compare
even 3DES of, say, 256 bits to IDEA of a few megabytes followed by MD5 of
same. Plus, it offers the operater even more deniability: he doesn't even
look at the whole file, but just enough to be sure that it's what it's
supposed to be.

Presumably, the data haven will specify how much a handful is, and offer a
client program that generates all this automatically.

You sent this to me privately, so that's how I'm replying. If you don't
mind, though, please forward this on to the list.
