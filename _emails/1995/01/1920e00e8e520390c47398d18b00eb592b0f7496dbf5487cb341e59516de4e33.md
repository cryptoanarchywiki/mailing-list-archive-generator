You might want to check out Brian LaMacchia's Ph.D. proposal to create
a new class of knowbot, to be termed "Internet Fish".  It is posted on 
http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/bal-home.html

LaMacchia's proposal is interesting in that his 'fish' seem to have 
limited autonomy, thus moving us closer to a content-addressable model
of net info retrieval.

Also of interest is RFC 1728: Resource Transponders, by C. Weider.  The
idea is that there should be meta-information (information about 
information) available for use by info retrieval programs like 'archie'.  
From ftp://nic.ddn.mil/rfc/rfc1728.txt

The following is extracted from LaMacchia's abstract:

> We will design, implement and deploy a system for constructing
> ``Internet Fish,'' a new type of resource discovery tool.  Internet
> Fish attempt to discover new sources of information related to a
> particular topic; characteristics that describe the topic of interest

> time.  As part of the information-gathering process Fish conduct
> long-term conversations with users; these conversations permit Fish to
> ask for human assistance when necessary and allow humans to
> dynamically reallocate Fish resources.  In addition, Fish facilitate
> *serendipitous* resource discovery; that is, the act of finding
> interesting information in an unexpected place or manner, information
> that we were ``lucky'' to have discovered.
