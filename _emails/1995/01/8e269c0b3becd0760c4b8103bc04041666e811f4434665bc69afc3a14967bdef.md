The Economist is my favorite magazine (my parents' too). I don't read it
regularly, but that has more to do with my being busy than anything else.

It succeeds in providing fairly balanced in-depth coverage of international 
news that isn't terribly Amerocentric or Anglocentric. At worst it's 
G7-centric, but I think that's entirely reasonable ;)  It's witty, politically
aware, relatively technically savvy. The articles exhibit a healthy (IMHO)
cynicism about what happens and why, yet maintain some idealism about what
should happen. It's not perfect, but it's difficult to imagine surpassing it.

I recently read an interview with Bill Gates in which he was asked which
periodicals he reads. His first response was: "The Economist, every page".
