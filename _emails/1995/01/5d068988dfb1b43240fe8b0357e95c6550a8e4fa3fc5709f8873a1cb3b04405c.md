The latter is what I was proposing.  Only the first one would charge via
FV, but the other ones would form a "closed system" that you could only
get into by going through one that charged.

That's not my assumption.  I think you may have misread my mail -- I
*agree* with you on this point.  Sorry if I was unclear!

As I said, it all depends on your level of paranoia....  I tend to think
that in such an organization, where the primary "product" is privacy,
each member would tend to watch all the other members like hawks, eager
to publicize any instance of the other guy not being sufficiently
zealous in protecting privacy.  (Of course, I'm assuming that people
like *you* will be running these services, i.e. people even more
paranoid about privacy than me.)

I think this is wrong.  In my model, each consortium model has two, a
for-pay and a for-free.  Anyone can send to a for-pay, but only a
consortium remailer can send to a for-free.  Not that complicated,
really.

To my mind, that's not a bug, it's a feature.  The consortium is
charging you a set fee for privacy, and you get to decide how many hops
are required to have a level of privacy you trust.

This is true of the scheme that I said I would be satisfied with (one
remailer + FV), but not true, I think, of the "overkill" scheme, which
was the consortium.

Well, I *think* I do, though I may be suffering from a bit of
dilletantism here -- I'm certainly no expert in cryptography, but I
think I understand the concepts involved.  We haven't even gotten into
the effect of encryption yet -- so far, we've just been talking, I
thought, about untraceability.  But as far as I can see, there's no
reason that the consortium pay-only-at-entry scheme couldn't work with
encrypted remailers.  Am I confused?  Couldn't you use the same
cryptographic chain as is currently used, where all the inner entries in
the chain are free crypto-remailers open only to other consortium
remailers, but in which the outer encrypted message had the FV payment
attached, which gained it entry to the remailer pool?

Again, I think you mis-read me.  I haven't (nor do I care to) spent a
lot of time thinking about how to do remailers at all, let alone with
digicash.  What I was referring to was the basic objections that come
from using a digital cash scheme in the first place.

I agree that FV doesn't meet the above requirements, but I don't see why
they're necessary for remailers.  In the consortium scheme I'd proposed,
the only thing that could ever be proven about you would be that you had
used a remailer.  Now, if the message was not encrypted, your anonymity
could be broken by collusion of FV and the "entry" remailer.  But if the
cypherpunks style cryptographic chain was used, i.e. if the contents
(including an inner envelope that said who you really sent it to) were
encrypted, nothing more would ever be derivable without the collusion of
everyone in the chain, and even then it would only be derivable if
certain records were kept.  

All I'm claiming is that it's do-able using the FV payment system.  I'm
not going to do it myself because I don't personally feel that this
level of untraceability is EVER legitimately necessary.....  -- Nathaniel
