Ralf,
	I hate to bother you, but I am setting up your premail program and 
tried the "premail -getkeys" but it never works. I tried to manually 
finger Matt's Pub Key area, but looks like he is down or has a different 
address. Is there somewhere else I can try to get the PGP Keys for the 
remailers, or does Matt have a different address? Any help would really 
be appreciated.
	Also does anyone have a patch for PINE 3.9X to get premail to work. 
I know I am kinda behind but just starting out and would really 
appreciate any help I can get. Again Thanks in Advance....
