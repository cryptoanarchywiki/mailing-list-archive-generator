Philip Weiss writes in tomorrow's Magazine a very long (52K) 
cover story on Idaho survivalists Bo Gritz, Randy Weaver and 
the burgeoning anti-government population.  The longest story 
I've seen in there in years.

Mentions societal threats of cashless economy, tax nix, and 
more c'punk tonics.

Is The Times getting antsy, seeding a L&O crackdown?  Or 
huffing luridities?

See for yerself by sending blank message with subject:  SUR_huf
