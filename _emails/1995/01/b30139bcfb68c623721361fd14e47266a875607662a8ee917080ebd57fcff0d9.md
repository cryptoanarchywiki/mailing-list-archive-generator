What is the state of the Windows/.dll PGP libraries?

Does anyone have a usable version yet?


I've been thinking of trying to wedge pgp/encrypted session ability
into some of the socket proxy programs out there.

For Windows: twnsck12.zip, which is simple, is GNU, and has source and
by writing a relatively simple windows serial terminal emulator and
using Comt ($15 or 25 shareware) to convert it to a telnet client.
Both of these could be modified fairly easily.

I think Twinsock (Troy's winsock, twnsck12.zip) would be the first
to work on, since it would cover whatever clients you would want to use.

It also should tunnel through multiple telnets since by default it escapes
just about everything.

Term would be a good Unix-Unix equivalent target.

Does anyone have better ideas?  Any suggestions on login/key
exchange sequence?
