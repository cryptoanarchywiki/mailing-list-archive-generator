I'd hardly call taking a day off being an asshole.  Is he supposed to 
staff the thing 24 hours a day 7 days a week?

No...its a small operation, that cannot be expected.

and you like the fact that you have NO idea who's running the place.

hardly...after the fit this woman threw.  CC'ing his private mail and 
interactions with her to COMPLETELY unrelated places .... such as

cypherpunks, nicholas negreponte of all people, wired, etc, etc, etc

as i understand the situation, the main contention here is that she was 
trying to sell space on her web pages.....on winternet's 
machines....without winternet's permission.

How would netcom react to such a situation (oh thats right....you're not 
allowed to have web pages)

How about a similar situation, such as you selling the time you don't use 
on your account to a friend and pocketing the money

no...instead, submit to the authority of 100 or so ANONYMOUS arrogant 
incompetent fools

he's not posting this all over the place....Carol had a fit and he chose 
to respond.  I'm afraid the baby here is Carol
