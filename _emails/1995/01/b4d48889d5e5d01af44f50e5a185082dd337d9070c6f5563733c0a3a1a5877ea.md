Would it be better if you didn't have to dedicate your box to Linux, but
just ran it every so often when you weren't playing with Codewright?  If you
had some store-and-forward mail system (like UUCP or Fido), you wouldn't
need to say goodbye to DOS/Windows.

I envision a setup right now where you could (if you wanted) type "remailer"
at the DOS prompt to bring the remailer up.  The screen would show a
monitor-type program, with a menu option to "R)eboot" to DOS again (or you
could just hit Ctrl-Alt-Del).

Oh, and I'd probably package a much nicer editor than vi with it.  Believe
it or not, the state of Unix editors has progressed beyond vi (and even
emacs).  But that's assuming you'd need to pull up an editor at all...
