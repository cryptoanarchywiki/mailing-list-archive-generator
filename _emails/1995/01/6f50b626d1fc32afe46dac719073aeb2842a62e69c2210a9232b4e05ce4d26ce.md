	The idea is a very good one, its usually called "link
encryption."  The idea is to make it difficult to tell when someone is
using a line by filling that line with random noise that looks like
encrypted data.

	Making a remailer do this is an interesting idea.  Perhaps a
subscription facility, so you can ask a remailer to send you X
messages per day, with X higher than your anticipated traffic?
Alternately, you could get roughly X messages per day, so a small
overflow wouldn't show up at once.

| "Subway" remailers would exchange identical sized "containers", much
| like a subway at semi-regular pulses or intervals. It would require
| a ring of remailers large enough (yeah, I know) to make traffic analysis
| of entrance and exit points difficult and/or expensive.
