But Dale, hat doesn't matter much.  the user is then going otu of his way 
tpo get rejected.  The data haven would be knwon to it's users to require 
encrypted text, and a user who did the scheme you outline above would 
only be succeding in getting himself rejected.  I mean it's nothe 
operators fault he decided to be snazzy and put iit in plaintext when it 
was known to be required to be encrypted, as in knowingly encrypted.
