First remailer knows you and your FV billing account.  Charges you
its own fee and the fee for all for profit remailers in the list.
(The envelope states what this fee is going to be) 

Second remailer charges first remailer.

Third remailer charges second remailer.

If the postage on the envelope is insufficient to cover all
the for profit remailers the message passes through, it gets
bounced or dropped.

In principle it could work, 

But blinded digital cash makes it a lot easier.  (blinded 
postage stamps)

I would not try to implement it.  Too much like hard work, for
an unnecessarily complex solution.
