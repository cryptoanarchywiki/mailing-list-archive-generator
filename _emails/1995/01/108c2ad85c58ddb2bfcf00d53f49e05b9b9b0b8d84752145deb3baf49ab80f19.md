Not quite.  If the socieities or guilds in question were to wake up to the
threat, they could easily have whatever institution issued certificates of
passing/degrees/etc. and sign them with their keys.   The licensee would
then attach his e-diploma to his .plan file for anyone to finger and verify
the signature.

So, there, on the internet, being a quack and getting away with it doesn't
have to happen. :-)
