So why not do a cheap trick:

After the small primes check calculate a CRC checksum over the number.
Then do the primality check. If it is a prime, store it together with
the CRC. The CRC can be checked for every use of the number.

(PGP encrypts the secret key and therefore it generates a CRC for the
encrypted packet. But this CRC is generate after the primality check.)


We already had some SIMM modules with bit errors. They were detected by
a parity check. If cheap pc simms don't have a real parity bit, the probability
of having such a bug isn't as low as 10^-40. If cheap parity-less simms
are available they get sold (cheap and expensive).

BTW: Some weeks ago they found motherbords with falsified cache rams:
They had just the normal DIL-ICs and the normal pins, but the plastic of
the ICs didn't contain a chip. The BIOS was modified to give out a message
about a good cache ram check at boot time.
