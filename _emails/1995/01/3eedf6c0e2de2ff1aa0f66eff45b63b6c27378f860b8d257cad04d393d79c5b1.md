does anynoe have any information about intelligent agents?  I mean I know 
about filter and stuff, but they arent intelligent agents.  I assume one 
would be something like the WWW worm and other searching scripts that 
have a database of information to cross-reference their finds and decide 
what to send back to you.  the WWWWorm is a good centralized illustration 
of this, with a searchable index of HTML pages.  Or is there osmethign 
else that makes upa  "intelligent agent"

i disagree storngly.  anonimity with almost no increase in latency or 
decrease in bandwidth is easily viable.  Especially if it was a group of 
coleagues planning to get together, I mean the remailers and stuff are a 
different thing altogehter, but ytalk or another confrencing system with 
untracable features is no problem, hell just a conference call dialing up 
from payphones, ora favorite hacker trick of running a conference of a 
COCOT.  etc....
