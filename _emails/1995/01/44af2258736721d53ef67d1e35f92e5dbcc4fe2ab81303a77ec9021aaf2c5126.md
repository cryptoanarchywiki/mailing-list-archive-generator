And did I mention that in DOS you can type 
   rename *.txt *.asc
to turn all *.txt files into the corresponding *.asc file

but that if in unix you type
   mv *.txt *.asc
not only will it not rename your *.txt files to be *.asc files, but
if you have only two *.txt files it will silently destroy the
second and issue no warning that anything has gone amiss.

Hell, it is only the users data -- stupid user, he can type
it in again.

And of course I have already mentioned the unix "make" utility.
