If c2.org can offer RIAB accounts on a pre-paid basis, what's to
stop people interested in the cause from paying anonymously,
setting up the RIAB, and just walking away? When the pre-paid period
expires, the remailer goes away. If the RIAB package could communicate
its existence and impending death to the pinging and verification services, 
the transient nature of remailers wouldn't be a problem. It would be hard
to harass an unknown walkaway remailer operator who has no involvement
with the day to day operations. If Tim's theory of isolating the
responsibilities of the remailer operator and the site owner are held to
be valid, c2.org would be off the hook. After all, c2.org didn't actually
set up the remailer, John Doe did. Finding JD would be impossible from
a practical standpoint, and since the remailer only lived for a few months,
the motive to find and attack it is less. . . a true "Guerrilla" RIAB.
