Sure, but as you point out in your second sentence, systems that are
secure enough for secret storage aren't exactly "typical" of what's out
there on the Internet.  And even an Orange book A rated system has to
be kept locked up, under guard and administered properly if you want to
be sure that the secret data stored on it remain secret.

The vast majority of unattended "server" machines in my online life are
neither located in well-controlled environments (especially considering
backup tapes) nor administered particularly well.  I'm not sure that
persistent signature keys stored on such hosts provide much extra
assurance of machine identity beyond what already comes from their
answering to the expected IP address (which is hardly saying much, of
course).  I think better than expecting the world to switch over to
cumbersome, multilevel secure OSs is to equip such servers with
inexpensive tamper-resistant cryptographic modules that never reveal
their secrets.  At least then you're guaranteed that there can be only
one instance of a machine's identity out there at a time, and have some
hope of detecting the theft of the key material.  (There may be some
hope on this front.  PCMCIA crypto modules like the NS iPower card are
beginning to hit the market already, and products like that may well be
commonplace by the time host authentication protocols start to be
deployed for real on the Internet.)
