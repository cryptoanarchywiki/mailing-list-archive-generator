Subject: I would suggest...

I would suggest that people interested in the threat described in this
morning's times find a copy for themselves of Steve Bellovin's classic
paper "Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite." It is
available from

ftp://research.att.com/dist/internet_security/ipext.ps.Z

People may also want to examine
