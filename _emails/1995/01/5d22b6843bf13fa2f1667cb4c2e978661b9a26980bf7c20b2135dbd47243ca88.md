If you want to run a remailer fairly safely, insist that all outgoing
mail be encrypted, and put an X bytes/day limit on destinations other
than other remailers.  Why?  Because that way you can't use it to post
to Usenet (other than to annoy people a little with unreadable
postings), and you can't use it to mailbomb someone, and if the
recipient doesn't decrypt the message, there will be no possible
offending content.
