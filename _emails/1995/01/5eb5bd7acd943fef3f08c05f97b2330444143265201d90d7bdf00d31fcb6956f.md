I am also using ISDN to get my network on through Southwestern Bell.
The charges I had to deal with were:

$135 deposit (refunded in 2 years)
$73 per month line rate (2B+D)
$350 per month for ISDN connection to another system on Internet and in
     Austin there is only one system that can do this for .com sites.
     This is a commen problem all over the country I understand.
$1150 for Combinet 160 w/ NT-1 for ISDN-Ethernet bridge.
$750 for account setup and for the folks at the other end to configure.

This is a little expensive for home use but well within the means of even
small businesses.

I am lucky in that I am flat rate.

We get charged only for the D channel traffic which is usually used for call
progress control. In general we don't use the D channel at all.

It is a clean, fast (300kbs w/ compression), and economical for a full time
feed as well.
