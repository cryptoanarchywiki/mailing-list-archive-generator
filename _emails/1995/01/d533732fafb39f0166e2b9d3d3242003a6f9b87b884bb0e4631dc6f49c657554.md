Right Tim it was a great article in the Economist Tradition.  I'll post 
it as soon as it makes it into the databases.

Unblievable Barlow Quote:

On-line purists might want nothing to do with government, but government 
was likely to intrude anyway.  So the EFF sought to minimise the 
intrusion; "to keep Pharoh from following us into the Red Sea," as Mr. 
Barlow puts it.


I *want* Pharoh to follow us into the Red Sea, myself.
