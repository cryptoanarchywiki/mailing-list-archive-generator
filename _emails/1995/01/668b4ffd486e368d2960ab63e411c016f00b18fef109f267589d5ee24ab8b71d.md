CNN reported on Monday that U.S. troops are being sent back to Somalia
to ensure and orderly and safe withdrawal of U.N. peacekeeping forces.

This might explain the few thousand Green Berets being sent, if this
is so. About the GPS, I have nok idea, though it seems plausible.

I know this has no Cypherpunks relevance, but I see a lot of
speculation, so I thought adding what CNN is reporting might help.
