I for one would not want to go in to more debt. I am in debt up to my 
neck due to a auto accident. I can not afford to go in to more debt. I am 
barely making it beacuse I owe on two loans, insurance, and money 
borrowed from relatives. This beacuse I thought I could afford X dollars 
a month more. I could if I wassnt out of work for as long as I was. When 
I have everything paid off, I belive I will not be borrowing anything 
else for a while. My question to you is, "Why borrow, if 1. you can 
afford to pay cash now, and 2. when you are going to have to pay more in 
the long run."
