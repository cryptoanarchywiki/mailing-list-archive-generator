    Is this the poem, Lucky?
    
         They [Nazis] came first for the Communists,
    and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist.
         Then they came for the Jews, 
    and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.
         Then they came for the Catholics, 
    and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.
         Then they came for me,
    and by that time there was no one left to speak up.

Close.  You left out trade unionists and misspelled his last name, but
certainly got the bulk of it.  I'm typing from a pink triangular
button only because it's close by (pinned to my clinic escorting hat),
but I've previously verified that it matches the text from other
sources.  Of course, it may very well be a translation . . . .

I believe that Rishab Ghosh also sent an approximation of this text
out to the list a while back.
