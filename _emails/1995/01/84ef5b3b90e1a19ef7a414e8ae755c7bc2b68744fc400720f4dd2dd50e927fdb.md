CPUNKS symposium  Thursday, Jan 26, 1995

   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission 
Cafe & Coffee Shop" were I hope to get an update of weasel man's new 
anonymous e-mail server, "mixmaster", exchange keys, and generally shoot the 
shit.

   Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure 
out how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.

Place: The Mission Cafe & Coffee Shop
      488-9060
      3795 Mission Bl in Mission Beach.

Time:1800

Their Directions:
     8 west to Mission Beach Ingram Exit
     Take west mission bay drive
     Go right on Mission Blvd.

     On the corner of San Jose and mission blvd.
     It is located between roller coaster and garnett.
     It's kind of 40s looking building...  funky looking (their description, 
not mine)

I will be wearing a  BRIGHT PURPLE BICYCLING JACKET.  Try to be their by 
18:30 since we may move the meeting.

See you there!

Weasel man, don't forget to bring the latest info on mixmaster.
Fish man, sweep the place for bugs.
Anarchist, the FBI has already setup surveillance.
Law man, bring the logo and your e-mail address of the month :)
New guy, bring your fingerprint.

NOTE: My e-mail address, "chris.claborne@sandiegoca.attgis.com" permanently 
replaces my .ncr.com address.  Both address work for now but NCR address 
will
eventually be killed.
