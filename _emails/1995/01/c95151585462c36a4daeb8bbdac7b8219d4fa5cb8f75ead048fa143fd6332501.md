Some time ago (perhaps even two years back) I seem to remember
discussion here--or in a related area--about a service some former
Bell Labs people were offering.  It was a time stamp/authentication
service which depended in part on publishing of a hash in a paper
of record.  I now find I have need for this service.  Pointers to
this service (by email) would be much appreciated.  Keith Henson
