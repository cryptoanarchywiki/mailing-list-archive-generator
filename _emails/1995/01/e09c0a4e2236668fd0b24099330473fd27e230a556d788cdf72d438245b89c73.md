Agreed.

Here, I don't understand your point.  If you mean an encrypted
message to a remailer cannot result in a plaintext usenet posting,
that of course is not true.  The remailers have PGP keys of their
own, just as any private user may.  In addition, some of the
remailers support direct usenet posting.  Thus, a message may be
encrypted to the remailer and posted as plaintext as the remailer
decrypts the message.

Agreed.  At least some remailers accept requests from users that they
not receive anonymous mail.  The process of "kill-filing" outbound
anonymous mail targeted for specific locations could of course be
automated.
