find works just fine for me...  there's also "whereis", in case you

so it give it "expected" input...  since when does DOS like "unexpected" 
input, anyhow?

could we see an example of this?  I have yet to find one.

again, provide an example.  again, I have yet to see one.

different operating systems have differences...  the differences between 
IBM PC-DOS and MS-DOS are a good example.

again, different OSes are different...  you don't expect every company to 
make the same UNIX, do you?  what point would there be in cloning each 
other?

I've never encountered this...  perhaps because I uuencode things and 
THEN send them rather than trying to pipe a uuencode into mail.

again, does DOS *not* do this?

at least UNIX gives you the option of killing a process in the first 
place...  I can remember having to reboot DOS and fiddling with multiple 
configuration hassles just to clear a device driver out in order to solve 
an incompability problem with another program.

I've done it.  Several times.  Within minutes, each time.  And I'm not a 
guru, either.  And, as you've pointed out, I wouldn't have had to do even 
that if I was working with an already-setup system.
