Right, so why did you answer (and to the list, no less) ?

If that were true, this thread would be long dead.

Right, so why are you sending it to the cypherpunks list ?

This was (briefly) promising.

If you hoped to end the thread, why continue it like this less than an hour
later ?

Why not spare us entirely by not sending all this mail which "has nothing to
do with cypherpunks" as you said ?

"Yes, James, you're absolutely right. I prostrate myself before your

Will you be quiet about this now ?  What do we need to do to make you hush up ?
