IMHO:

When are people going to realize that Windows NT is just a partial,
microkernel (?right), enhanced scheduler Unix?  Add the other
half with NutCracker or Consensys's product (what's it called?),
and you have have a Posix (not just shell) and Unix SysVR4.2
compatible environment (Supposedly).

Unless they make too many mistakes of not staying simple with
core concepts or not implementing enough basic building blocks,
I can hopefully treat it as just another Unix platform.

<Obviously still irritated that companies think (or know...) that
they can eek out more money by reinventing instead of refurbishing
or augmenting something flexible enough to do anything they want.
Face it: there is nothing I can't add to a Unix system, and it wouldn't
have to affect existing programs one bit.>
