This sounds like a good idea.  It was very interesting to see your
earlier result on the impact of dummy messages on this approach.  Even a
relatively small number of batches without dummy messages allows
continual accumulation of incriminating information.

I know that the Eurocrypt 89 proceedings had some articles on
cryptanalyzing Chaum's mixes.  My library has an excellent crypto
selection but is missing this volume.  Can anyone who has read this say
whether there is anything in those papers that isn't obvious?

Another interesting aspect of your analysis is the possible role of
latency.  Earlier I had thought of latency as primarily a way of doing
mixing, an alternative or addition to batching which mixes messages
without holding them up quite as much.  But in terms of this in/out
analysis latency could play a part in blurring the batch boundaries,
adding more uncertainty and making the job of the analyst harder so he
would need more data to establish his scores.
