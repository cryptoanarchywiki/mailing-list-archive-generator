I see copies in used bookstores often. It's in the collection "True
Names and Something-or-other" and was in print until recenly. I also
have the Bluejay edition, with an afterward by Marvin Minsky.

I bought one at Half-Price Books.  I don't know what edition it is, 
it's a dingy little paperback with a signature in it of some stranger 
that I wouldn't know.   I keep it with my "previously owned" collection.
