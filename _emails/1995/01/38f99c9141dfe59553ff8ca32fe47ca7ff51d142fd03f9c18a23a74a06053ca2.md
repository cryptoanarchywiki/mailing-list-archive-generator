                E-MAIL SECURITY WITH PGP AND PEM:
          HOW TO KEEP YOUR ELECTRONIC MESSAGES PRIVATE

                 ...a new book by Bruce Schneier

                     John Wiley & Sons, 1995
                       ISBN  0-471-05318-X
                             $24.95

The world of e-mail is the world of postcards.  Between you and
your correspondents may lurk a foreign government, a business
competitor, an overzealous law enforcement agency, or even just a
nosy neighbor.  The problem is, all of these potential
eavesdroppers, given fairly simple access tools, can read your
messages as easy as a postal worker can read your postcards.

E-MAIL SECURITY is about protecting electronic mail fm spies,
interlopers, and spoofs--people who may want to destroy, alter,
or just look at your private communications.  The book shows how
you can protect the financial information, contract negotiations,
or personal correspondence you entrust to public or private
networks--and it shows how this protection is available right
now, with free or inexpensive software.

The book discusses PGP and PEM: how they work, how they are
different, and how to choose which one is right for you.
