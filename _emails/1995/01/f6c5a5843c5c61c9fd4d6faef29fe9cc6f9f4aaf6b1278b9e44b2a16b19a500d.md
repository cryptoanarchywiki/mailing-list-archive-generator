No bet. ;)  The computer press is pretty imature, they'll report almost
anything.

Personally, I think both Carol Anne Braddock and Mike Horwath BOTH need to
grow up, along wih a substantial number of the snipers and slammers and
back-seat-driver commentators regarding this thread.

Maybe they ought to restrict net access by age?  25 or so oughta be a good
age ... anyone younger is barred from access, or unless they provide
evidence that they have a maturity level greater than that of your average
six-year-old.
