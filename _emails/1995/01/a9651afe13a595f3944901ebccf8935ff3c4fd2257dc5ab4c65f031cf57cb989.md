Associated Press reported on 1/20/95:
 
>Secretary of State Warren Christopher Friday announced 
>plans to combat narcotics smuggling and terrorism with tougher 
>laws and sentences and tighter control on visas for entering the 
>United States. 
>   
>A senior State Department official said wiretapping was among the 
>measures to be proposed to the Republican-controlled Congress. The 
>official said there were ways to use wiretaps without violating 
>Supreme Court restrictions. 


Since wiretapping on court order from their no-questions-asked secret 
court is already allowed, can they mean anything other than wiretapping 
without court order?

Can somebody explain to me why the Clinton administration is
considered "liberal"?  Why the Republicans are considered
"conservative"?
