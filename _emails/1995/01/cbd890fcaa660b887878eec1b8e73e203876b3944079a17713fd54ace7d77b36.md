While the issue is interesting (using anonymous mailers to violate
copyrights or to expose scams, depending on your view of the content),
the apparent aim of the Scientologists isn't met by approaching the
cypherpunk remailers: the specific anonymous postings have been through
penet so far, I think.

You missplet "anonymous".  Hope this helps.

The only "proposed legislation" I know of was proposed by Martha Siegel,
the greencard guru from CyberHell.  Any others?

Yeah, right.  People unclear on the concept of anonymous remailers.
Maybe they should be talking to the mail-to-news forwarders instead.
