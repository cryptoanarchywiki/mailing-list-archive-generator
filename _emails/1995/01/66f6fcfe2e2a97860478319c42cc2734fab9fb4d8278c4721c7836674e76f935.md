This is oddly timely.  The LaMacchia decision showed that providing a
service for others to use for the distribution of copyrighted material
(in his case, copyrighted software) was not prosecutable under Wire
Fraud statutes.  The judge told the Feds, "no dice.  Stop trying to
applying laws to areas where they weren't intended."

Civil matters are another matter, of course, but that's one avenue
that's closed.
