I posed this question in alt.wired. Am I missing something obvious as to
why Wired (or magazines in general) don't do this to make subscribing
easier?
=========================================================================
Why doesn't Wired if it is sooooooo hooked in the online culture have a
PGP public key that 'net users could use to send in their credit card
numbers for subscriptions?

Its a hell of alot easier than mailing in a cheque or money order. And just
as safe. Wired could have an electronic "form" you could request for them,
to which the public key is attached. You type in the info on the form (ie
name, address, phone number, credit card number etc etc) and encrypt it
and send it to their e-mail address for subscriptions.

Wired then fires off a followup message to the e-mail address from which it
came. Obviously if the address bounces, then the subscription is cancelled.
Or it can also snailmail a subscription  confirmation to the persons adress.

Whatever. I just think it would be an easier, on-line way of doing things.
They could use Via Crypt, the commercial PGP version, in keeping with
the widespread use of PGP on the net.
===========================================================================

Personally, I think that IF major enterprises like Wired would use a PGP
application in subscriptions it would contribute greatly to the use of
PGP awareness on the 'net. And that I thought was one of the cypherpunk
items on the agenda.
