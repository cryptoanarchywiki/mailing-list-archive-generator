I just had CNN on for background noise. They did a one minute piece on a 
new threat to the internet. HACKERS. Bizdos for some reason was on it and 
they went slightly into why transmitting credit card numbers as plain 
text was stupid. Their estimate is that encryption is at least five years 
away. Just amazing... BTW- they recommended that everyone install routers 
to hinder hackers. Check it out...it was on headline news so it probably 
will be repeated every half hour.
