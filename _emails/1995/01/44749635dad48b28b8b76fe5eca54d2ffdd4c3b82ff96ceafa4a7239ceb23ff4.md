But what happens if, say, a minor is solicited for sex when they are
pretending to be older than they are ? Or if the solicitation comes via a
remailer ?  Or a minor with a grudge fakes email to show that someone 
attempted to get them to agree to sex/picture-taking or whatever ?

Once you pass laws making some forms of communication illegal, you're 
immediately getting into dodgy territory requiring is-a-person 
credentials and so on. That isn't neccesarily a problem if it's voluntary 
(e.g. your kids accounts might be set up to only accept mail from people 
who're certified to be under 18 or whatever), but governments are 
unlikely to do things that way.
