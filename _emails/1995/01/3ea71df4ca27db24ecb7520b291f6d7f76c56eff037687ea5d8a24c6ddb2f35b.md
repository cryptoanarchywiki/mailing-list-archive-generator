Interesting.  You did retrieve the message I posted, but not the article 
from alt.current-events.net-abuse.  If you want to call me a liar, that's 
fine, but post something with some relevance.  I'm not in the habit of 
scanning the news hierarchy for spam, and I'm perfectly willing to believe 
you stopped after ten groups, but that isn't what I recalled seeing in 
a.c-e.n-a.  I could be remebering things wrong, but if that is the case, 
kindly post something that actually shows the discussion in a.c-e.n-a was 
otherwise.

And now you're sounding like Martha Siegel.  My words were:

Am I rememebering a.c-e.n-a inaccurately, or have you simply decided not to 
rebut anything in the forum in which it was presented?  All I suggested is 
that your account bore checking out before people leaped to your defense.  
An unwillingness to have your story verified speaks for itself.
