Heh. An anonymous remailer paid for by credit card... there'd
have to be an additional level of indirection for it to work,
which would make the methods for tracking those who don't pay
quite problematic.

Also, most remailer abuse tends to be of the hit-and-run variety,
which is still nicely enabled by FV.

Anonymous remailers pretty much require anonymous digital cash,
although this could be built on top of some other electronic
payment system with somewhat less payment lag and reversability 
than FV.
