Criminalize anonymity, and tell the internet providers to figure
out how to enforce it or face confiscation.

After that, they can get involved in the standards business to
ensure that when the current 32 bit internet address space
is upgraded, we go with a system where the technology 
supports centralized administration rather than anarchy.

They can do it -- but they probably will not.  Recent political
events mean that such actions can only be done on presidential
authority.   It will be impossible to obtain new law to enforce
such measures for at least four years.


There will be eventually a big confrontation between governments
and liberty in cyberspace -- but I doubt that this is it.

This one can be won with a few letters to the editor.
