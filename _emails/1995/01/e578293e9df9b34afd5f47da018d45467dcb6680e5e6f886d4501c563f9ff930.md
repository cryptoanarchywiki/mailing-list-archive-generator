	Anonymous mail has bandwidth costs that are only slightly
higher than regular mail.  You could hide quite a bit in most video
packets.  The latency is a reflection of the lack of volume, because
volume is needed for reordering.  If your favorite remailer gets more
mail, the latency will drop.

	Also, on the book trend, Neal Stephenson's new book, The
Diamond Age (Bantam Spectra, 1995) has a brilliant hacker dump
information he comes across becuase its encrypted, and he knows he'll
never manage to break the encryption scheme.  I haven't finished it,
but its quite good about 1/3 of the way through.
