However, if there are a large number of 900 MHz radio modems operating in 
a cryptographically secure spread-spectrum method, it may be very 
difficult to locate your particular transmitter...however the modem you 
are talking to will know your pseudonoise sequence, and a receiver that 
knows this will have a much easier time tracking you down.
