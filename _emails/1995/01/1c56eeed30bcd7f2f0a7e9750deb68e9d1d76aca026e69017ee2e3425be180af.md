That's the main reason why I like my idea of having a trusted encryptor.
Nobody's suggested that the current timestamp operators would be in Deep
Doo-Doo if they timestampped some piece of thoughtcrime; why should
somebody who encrypts be any different?

The service could even be advertised as a different form of timestamping
(or notarizing). Not only do you get the file back signed, but you get it
back encrypted and signed.
