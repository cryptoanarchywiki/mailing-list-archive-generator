This assumes that governments have the necessary wisdom
to tell a bad architect from a good architect.   This does
not seem very plausible.

What most people would do is look at the certificate issued by
various certifying organizations  -- for example the doctores
university.

While universities often issue or refrain from issuing certificates
for corrupt and improper reasons, government supervision on this 
matter is unlikely to keep them honest --- indeed it is more likely
to force them to be dishonest, or to force them to deny their own
sound judgment in favor of arbitrary and foolish criteria imposed
by some ignorant and arrogant bureaucrat.
