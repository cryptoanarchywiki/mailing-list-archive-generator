If you chain it through 3 or 4 remailers with PGP, then pretty much all 3
or 4 of them have got to decide to sell you out.  I trust Julf a lot, but
I'm not sure I trust him four times as much as much as every other remailer
operator.  Or something like that.

You can also probably use penet as a link on your larger chain, although
I've never tried this to see how it works.

And I would note that the "subtle ethical discussion" seemed to consist of
the operator trying to figure out what he should do in the future about
this sort of thing, and he never even seemed to consider turning over the
name of the anon user.  Although he did acknowledge that in the future he
might, or might work with other operators to try and discover a True Name.
*shrug*
