As I recall there was something of a national outcry about this practice
several years back. I think California outlawed it at the time, along with
other states, though I don't know if any federal law was passed.

Since I understand MBNA America is the second-largest employer in Delaware,
I'd guess that if Delaware banned it, so did most states.

Retail stores often asked one to write one's phone number on the check when
paying that way. I remember my father habitually writing the police dept.'s
non-emergency number in all such cases :]
