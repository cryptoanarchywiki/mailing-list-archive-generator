I'm catching up on old mail...

I caught that.  What I was hoping for was something that would allow
a key to be use for a specific purpose once and only once by a given
passphrase.  Ideally, this could be done on a machine that was totally
insecure.

I didn't catch the fundamental flaw, though.  If the machine is
compromised the key can always be compromised by taking an image of the
previous state and replaying whatever passphrase was intercepted.

Bummer.
