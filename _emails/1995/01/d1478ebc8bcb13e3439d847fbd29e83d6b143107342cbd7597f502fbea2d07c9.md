I don't think supporting the free market has anything to do with 
supporting bad products.  I separate my ideological views from my 
technical opinions, quite frankly.  In addition, when did I single out 
Microsoft?  IBM and Apple make plenty of crappy products, which is ironic 
since they also make UNIX products that are technically superior and 
should probably be the de facto operating systems for their high-end 
machines (in fact, in IBM's case, they are - AIX is the default OS on rs6000 
machines).

that depends on what applications you're talking about...  if you mean 
Word Processors, Spreadsheets, and (perhaps) games, then I'd have to 
agree.  If you're talking about programming environments/tools, graphical 
interfaces, networking software, graphic design software, or file server 
applications, not to mention at least a few other categories, I'd have to 
disagree strongly.

so UNIX users aren't "normal" now, eh?  by what standard do you define 
normal?

we're talking about both client AND server applications here, as well as 
the robustness of the multitasking/threading capabilities of the OS they 
run on.  when surfing the net, it's best not to have your news reader 
choke because your web browser needs more resources.

simple - they never will run the same, and they definitely won't run 
better, unless of course they are morphed into UNIX...  and I wouldn't be 
surprised if they do.  I see a day sometime not too far into the future 
when Windows, OS/2, and their kin either vanish completely or at least as 
non-UNIX operating systems, and are replaced with look-alike UNIX 
flavours with commercial app support.  if Microsoft, IBM, and/or Apple 
have the guts, that is.
