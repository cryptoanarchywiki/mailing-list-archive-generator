Why not -- sounds cool to me.   It is also very fast, and does not
take much programming.

It will stop all cleartext.  Probably some pictures would get through,
so it would not stop mailbombings, but a volume limitation per 
apparent user and apparent destination would stop mailbombings.

A volume limitation sounds like a lot of work to program though.
