   Well, in reality you still can catch them,  after all no one can sexually
   assault anyone over the internet (yet, anyway).

Mmmm, being the parent of two children, I have to disagree.  The brain
is the primary sexual organ, after all.

   Sometime they've got to do something in person, and there's no
   encryption in a physical meeting, where everyone sees your
   TrueFace.  But I'm not sure how much I trust the gubmint types to
   take this all into account, instead of just abolishing crypto on
   the typical four horsemen platform.

Hey, I don't trust the gubmint either, that's why I called Bob to get
an explanation.  I really *don't* think that New York State plans to
ban encryption, not now and not over this issue anyway.  His thrust is
1) to have the legal authority to sufficiently punish someone who goes
after children (which they don't have now), and 2) to educate guardians
about the risks of untoward communications from adults to children.
