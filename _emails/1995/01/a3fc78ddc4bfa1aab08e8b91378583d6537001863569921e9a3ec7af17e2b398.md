This may be interesting. Practically the entire revenue stream for the
"Church" of "Scientology" comes from "sales" of this "literature".  If
someone publishes it on the internet anonymously, the revenue accounts of
the Co$ may become "Clear". Ahem.

Meanwhile, theology and philosophy departments everywhere are fighting for
funding to put most of the legitimate canon in their fields on the net for
free...
