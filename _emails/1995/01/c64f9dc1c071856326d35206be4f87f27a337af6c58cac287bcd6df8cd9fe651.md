I attempted to set something like this up about 7 months ago.  I got so
little interest that I never set up the mailing list.

Better than a single person's address, I'd suggest a pgp-help mailing
list for all interested folks, just as the flexfax list works for 
flexfax users and commercial products have their own lists.

I just set up a list on pgp-help@hks.net, and I'll place
pgp-questions@lsd.com on the list (assuming you won't object).

Anybody else who's interested, send me mail at pgp-help-request@hks.net.
I don't have the list of folks who volunteered last time, so this'll be
fresh.
