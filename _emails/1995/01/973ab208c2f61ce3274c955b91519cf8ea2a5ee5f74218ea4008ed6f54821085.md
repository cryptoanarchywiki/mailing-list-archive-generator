I must disagree.

This hinges on the REASON for encrypting the data.  In my model, data 
that arrives at the haven unencrypted is unwelcome, and is encrypted to 
be used as traffic "noise," not for security.  Any unencrypted data is 
undesireable, it opening the door to kiddieporn by mail tactics.  
(Government sends user A kiddie porn, then arrests user A for kiddie porn 
possession.)

An automatic encryption of all unencrypted data, the key to which is 
randomly generated and destroyed, allows the traffic to foil analysis, 
while prevents the operator from being subjected to plant frames.

Decrypt on arrival is hardly defenseable in this context of course.
