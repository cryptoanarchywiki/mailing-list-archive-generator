Another quote from the article posted elsewhere said that, "PGP, which is
based on the Diffie-Hellman public-key technology developed in the 1970s..."
This is technically true, since all public-key work (including RSA) is based
to some extent on DH.  It could be, however, that the author is confusing
public-key technology with Diffie-Hellman public-key in particular, which
(as I understand it) is not particularly secure.
