The whole point of a "data haven" is that the site of operation is in a 
jurisdiction where these things are not legal problems.  If you operate a DH 
in a location where child pornography/copyright laws are vigorously 
enforced, I really doubt that encryption is going to make any difference.  
As Robert rightly points out, a DH probably will become a location of 
massive copyright violation, etc ad nauseum.

I've cc'ed Mike Godwin on this in the hope that he can shed some light on 
what the scienter requirements for something like this would be.
