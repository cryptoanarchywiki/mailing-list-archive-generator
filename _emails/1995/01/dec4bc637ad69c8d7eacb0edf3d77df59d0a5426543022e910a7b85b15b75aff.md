You do not need to trust the time stamper at all, because from time
to time he publishes a one way checksum of everything he has
time stamped, or rather the audit trail for everything he
has time stamped.

So if the credibility of his stamp is questioned he just produces
the audit trail, and you know that the audit trail must have 
been created at the time claimed, because its checksum was
published at the time claimed.
