As a mail administrator for many years, I've never seen a site crash
because of a filling disk partition due to mail overload. I've seen
Sendmail shut itself down temporarily, but thats to be expected. As
for the question of mail overload for one user harming the others, its
a design decision.  The only alternative is to produce quotas for mail
delivery, which at most of the places I run would be a very bad thing.
Strictly speaking, sendmail has nothing to do with local delivery and
isn't in a position to do any of this anyway -- but its easy enough to
change the local mailer (which is not part of sendmail) to do quotas
if you like.
