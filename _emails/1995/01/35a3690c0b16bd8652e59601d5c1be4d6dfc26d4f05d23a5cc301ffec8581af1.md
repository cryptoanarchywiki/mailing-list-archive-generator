The goal is to convince the two groups of concerned parties that the
remailer operators don't know the contents of what's passing through
their remailers:

         (1) the people who use the remailer, who get a measure of 
             comfort from knowing their communication is secure

         (2) legal groups etc. who may try to hold the remailer 
             liable in some way for what passes through their remailer.

A large percentage of material that passes through remailers might
be offensive to SOMEONE---if even just because an unpopular opinion
is expressed.  

The remailers are operated by people who want to promote information
flow, not restrict it.  They provide an important service that is of
critical importance to some people and groups who use the net.  They
shouldn't be held accountable for the few who abuse the remailers,
and encryption helps prevent that from happening.
