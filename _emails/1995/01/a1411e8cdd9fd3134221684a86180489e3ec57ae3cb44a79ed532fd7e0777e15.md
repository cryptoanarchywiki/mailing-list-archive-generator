	I could write a procmail recipe and a script in about an hour to
automatically secret-share-split and redistribute the incoming submission.
If the authorities attempt to indict you for possessing illegal
information / kiddie porn / whatnot, they have to prove that you
interfered with the automatic redistribution process and examined the
contents of the submission. If you in fact did not look at the submission,
they would have a difficult time doing so.
