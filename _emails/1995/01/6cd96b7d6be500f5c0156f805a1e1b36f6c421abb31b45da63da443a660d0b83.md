Re: anon communications

Hello...

There are many reason that anonymous communications are needed,
I will just focus briefly on one that is important to our business.

When we post jobs on the Internet we need to remain anonymous. We
do this when we place ads in the NY Times as well.

This is just one reason why anonymous communication on the Internet
is very important.
