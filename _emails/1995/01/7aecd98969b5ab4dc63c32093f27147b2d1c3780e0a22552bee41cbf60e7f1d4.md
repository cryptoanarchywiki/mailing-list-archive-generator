This is what you get if you interpret the above as a URL...which makes
sense since that was how it was posted.

What it really is is the host name and port name to configure your
Web browser so that all your HTTP traffic is funnelled through CERN
first, and then relayed from there to the destination.  I don't know
how Mosaic supports this, but under Netscape for Windows, it is under
Options | Preferences | Mail and Proxies | HTTP Proxy.

While this doesn't provide complete anonymity, it does prevent your 
email address, site name, etc. from appearing in the log files of the 
HTTP server you are connecting to.

I'm not sure why CERN has this running, but it is pretty usefull
nonetheless.
