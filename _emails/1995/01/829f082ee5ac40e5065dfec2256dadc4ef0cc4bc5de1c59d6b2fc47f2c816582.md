I have a server (WWW and ftp) that I would like to use for anything anyone
needs a place for. Drop me a line, or visit what's on my server (see
below). The part of the server that I will be putting cypherpunk related
material is password controled, and cannot be accessed unless you have am
account and password (assuming of course someone else doesn't break in and
figure someone's out that is... but I don't see how they could.)

This is just FYI for all and anyone!
Cheers,
- -J
