These groups are important to me. It is why I posted them there. I use

PGP extensively in my usenet postings, and I am not the only one in those

groups that posts with PGP. Yes, suffice to say, I endorse this letter.

I dream of a day when we do not have to deal with this issue, yet it is

something that affects any one who uses the program. All that was really

asked was not to go to the meeting with the D.A., and make a protest.

MOST CYPHERPUNKS I KNOW OF COULDN'T HAVE MADE IT ANYWAY, THIS TIME, BECAUSE

THE STAKES IN THE REMAILER GAME ARE HIGH, AND WITHIN A MONTH OR TWO, THERE

WILL BE SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN GET SOME MONEY TO EAT WITH AND BUY EQUIPMENT.

But on the user level, I do my best to TEACH GOOD FUNDAMENTAL COMPUTER

SAFETY. Rumors are no good for this. There was PRZ's letter to us, and

Dubois's letter to alt.security pgp. Those are facts. Those I can teach

with, and so can even a one month PGP Cypherpunk Novice. So can you.

Now, the first reply,
