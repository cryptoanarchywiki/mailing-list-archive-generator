Hmm. I post through a long anonymous remailer chain to an appropriate newsgroup:
"I have made an archive of state secrets (or trade secrets, for that
matter, or pornography), available on data haven Wherever. Ask to receieve
the following file for a list of contents."

Seems it could be useful. Especially if you had some way of extracting
digicash payment from it, in an anonymous way.  But even if you didn't,
perhaps you want to make this info available as a public service. I sure as
heck wouldn't want it sitting on a hard drive in my bedroom.
