BBC WSTV reports on commerce on the Net prior to a special G7 meet on
the implications of the infosphere. Surprisingly, they don't mention
anarchic blackmarketeers; more surprisingly they don't mention encryption -
which one might expect when they talk about a one-man garage firm settling
multimillion $ commodities trade contracts over the Net.

Some people are about to learn something really fast. Let's hope they don't
react like C&S.
