It is probably a CYA move on the part of the University....if someone 
at SFSU is plotting the overthrow of our (or any other) government, 
engaging in espionage, child porn, etc. and using their Internet 
account, SFSU admin probably wants a way that they don't get held 
liable.

However, my view of this is that is sucks.

It would have to...otherwise how would they know if they needed to 
disclose it.

From their perspective, prior notice would probably mean they tell 
you before they do it.  While I don't have experience specifically 
with SFSU, it seems as though large organizations tend to do whatever 
they please.

Probably anything that is involved in an active criminal

Note that any thing in this message is just my opinion, and most 
assurdly could prove to be different when exposed to the real world!!
