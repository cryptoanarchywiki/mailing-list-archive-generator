While in a way what you say is true, latex isn't Unix, the shell isn't the
only interface to Unix, etc.  Unixware's setup was an example.  Solaris's
isn't too bad (setup printers, mounts, user accounts, ttys (kinda)), etc.
Put Frame, WP, MS Word (some version at least), Lotus 123, Powerbuilder
(was going to be out end 94, haven't kept track), etc. on a Unix
system that boots to xdm and you have a pretty darn good replacement
for Windows/NT/OS2, etc.

With any kind of support staff, Unix systems are much smoother and robust
than PCs.  I've seen it at several really large sites.  No comparison.

Ok, I guess I'm getting 'religious' here, which isn't the place...
