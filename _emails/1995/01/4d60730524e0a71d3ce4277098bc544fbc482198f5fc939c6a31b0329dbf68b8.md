One well-travelled path to success is through the Foreign Policy
Association, and being published in the journal "Foreign Affairs".  Many of
the wonks climbed this greasy pole -- Kissinger et al. 
 
 
Thus, an article on cryptography, PGP and its beneficial use for -- or
threat to -- foreign policy and arms control might be sent to the
publisher: 
 
 
     James Hoge, Editor 
     Foreign Affairs 
     58 East 68th Street 
     New York, NY 10021 
     (212) 734-0400 
 
 
The Foreign Policy Association runs seminars, junkets, fellowships,
retreats, advances, and cartels for aspiring and decrepit world leaders and
public opinion spew-gushers.  So perhaps there might be receptivity to a
seminar on PGP and public crypto for the high-domed dim-bulbs. 
 
 
     Foreign Policy Association 
     729 7th Avenue, 8th Floor 
     New York, NY 10019 
     (212) 764-4050 
 
 
Then, there's the Carnegie stable of world meddlers which sponsors fledging
and sinewy American eagles and vultures: 
 
 
     Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs, 170 East 64th
St, NY, NY 10021. 
 
     Carnegie Leadership Program, 170 East 64th St, NY, NY 10021 
 
     Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology & Government, 437 Madison,
NY, NY 10021. 
 
     Carnegie Foundation, 437 Madison Avenue, NY, NY 10021 (the main honey
pot). 
 
     Carnegie Foundation for World Something in DC. 
 
 
These and a cackling aviary in VA black-farms are the roosts of the big
arms poachers and clip-wingers. 
 
 
Golly, must dear tender Phil hang with these peckerwoods?
