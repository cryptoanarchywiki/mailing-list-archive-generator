Also, the current issue of "Axcess" magazine (a slick cyber-zine)
has an interview with Hakim Bey in which he mentions the cypherpunks
as one of the few groups doing something worthwhile in cyberspace,
or words to that effect.  I'd post the short passage, but the copy
emailed to me by the editor was garbled (heh).
