I thought that this might amuse:

Newsgroups: rec.humor.funny
From: scotta@kije.gsfc.nasa.gov (Scott Austin)
Subject: Information Superhighway: The Real Scoop

As seen in "Abort, Retry, Fail?", by Don Willmont, from the July '94 PC 
Magazine.

-------------------------
Renaming the Info Highway
-------------------------

We asked you to help us rename the Information Highway, and boy, did you ever!

[runner-up info deleted]

The winner is Kevin Kwaku, who suggested that while the Information 
Superhighway is a bad name, it could be a great acronym, standing for 

"Interactive Network For Organizing, Retrieving, Manipulating, Accessing, 
 And Transferring Information On National Systems, Unleasing Practically
 Every Rebellious Human Intelligence, Gratifying Hackers, Wiseacres, And
 Yahoos."
