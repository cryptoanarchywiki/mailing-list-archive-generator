: I guess it'd be possible to treat remailers as disposable - when one
: had pissed off enough people, it could be abandoned - but this lack
: of long-term reliability seems poor.

The enrty point of a remailer could be "fixed", the exit point is where
the heat is on.

 - The entry point of a remailer is entry@remail.org, 

 - entry@remail.org has a forward file to: batch@remail.org

 - batch@remail.org does the actual remailing, since remail.org has
   installed some sort of MX'ing all messages that leave batch@remail.org
   will advertise themself as nobody@expendable.org .

 - If you "loose" expendable.org, you simple set up a new account with
   MX'ing, the remailer-users will only notice the change in exit-header,
   the enrty-point of that remailer is still entry@remail.org

Ofcource you can make this as complicated as you like. :)
