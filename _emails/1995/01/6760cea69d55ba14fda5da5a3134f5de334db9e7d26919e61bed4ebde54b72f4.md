UNIX is a _networking_ OS, in my mind, above and beyond anything else
which the 'mainstream' may desire.

If I want Excel, Word or Powerpoint, I'll use my PC (which is completely
compatible, via PPP, and able to exchange data) to work within these
obviously proprietary formats. :-)

Microsoft hasn't really made any attempt to enbrace the UNIX community.

Why should we emmrace Microsoft?
