Perhaps it's just me, but I thought the header that was substituted a few
days ago was designed to be a subtle hit to the flamers.  Since it seems
not to have worked, allow me to be a bit more explicit.

HEY, MORONS!  THIS IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE
FURTHERANCE OF CRYPTOGRPAHY.  While it is true that to persons not familiar
with a particular operating system, it may appear cryptic, this really
isn't what cryptography is all about.  TAKE IT ELSEWHERE!

Thank you.  Have a nice day.  Teco rules!
