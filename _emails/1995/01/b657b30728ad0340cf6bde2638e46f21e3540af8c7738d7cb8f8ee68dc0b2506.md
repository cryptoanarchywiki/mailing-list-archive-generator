   For the moment, all of the archives that Eric just dropped me are on
   ftp://ftp.hks.net/cypherpunks/All

This includes all the stored messages at toad.com from the beginning
of time up to a few months ago.  I've got a short lacuna at toad.com
from some deletion I never understood, but it's only a few weeks long
and is covered by Todd's archive.

I would like someone to make an official enumeration of the articles
as they passed out to the list for global reference.  You may
self-volunteer by grabbing the archives above and starting.

Eric
