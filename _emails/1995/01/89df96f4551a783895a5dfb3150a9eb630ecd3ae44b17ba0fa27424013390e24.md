Given the current state of computer security, this should 
not be too difficult for an organization such as NSA.  For 
each remailer, just hack into a computer on its local 
ethernet and put it into promiscious mode.  Each time an 
e-mail passes by, have it send the header to some monitoring 
center using an UDP packet.

Complete monitoring should not be neccessary, having a 
larger percentage of the traffic just makes the job easier.
