Quite possibly the timestampers would be in trouble, the risk for them is 
the same as the risk for the remailers and the DH operators.  As long as 
some piece of info is considered to be a thought-crime, everyone who accepts 
info from a wide range of sources is at risk.

That would still be a useful service, however, but it does transfer the risk 
from the DH operator to the encryptor.  Since he isn't leaving evidence on a 
hard drive, his window of vunerability is somewhat less.
