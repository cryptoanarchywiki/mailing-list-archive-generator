Why not, "It's a pseudonym."?

Looks like an evangelistic opportunity to me. Pseudonyms can't be illegal,
or Mark Twain and Bob Dylan would have written from prison. ;-).

I also don't believe that you are legally required to produce ID for a
credit card purchase.  That was the point about those pictures on the front
of Citibank cards. Citicorp did that to get around the legal restrictions
on demanding ID to cope with the much larger issue of fraud. Most (smaller)
vendors hardly check the signature on the back, much less validating it
against a state ID, however.

Hmmm. What if you produced a pseudonym card *with* your picture on the
front?  I smell a market opportunity. Or not...

Indeed.
