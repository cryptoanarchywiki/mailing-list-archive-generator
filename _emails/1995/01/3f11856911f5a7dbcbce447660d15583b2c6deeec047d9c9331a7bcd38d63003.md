Just ran across a pretty nice (IMHO) short piece of media coverage of Clipper
in a local weekly, the [Pioneer] Valley Advocate. This is item #85 in the "Tech
Check" section of their list of "95 Things to Watch for in 1995". Joint authors
of the whole forecast are: Mark Kendall Anderson, Everett Hafner, Stephanie 
Kraft, Tom Mudd, Steve Penhollow, Chris Rohmann, David Simons, Michael Strohl,
and Rob Weir.

85. Clipper Clipping Along

Unfortunately, the failure of the mainstream media to cover the government's
steamroller tactics in technology policy may well continue. The ``Clipper 
Chip,'' what NSA, CIA and FBI spooks see as the ideal data protection measure,
stands to become national standard if all goes as planned. That is, as more
people communicate with digital devices (computers and TVs and eventually
telephones and faxes) the need to scramble and unscramble communications will
increase -- ideally so that the phone conversation you have with your uncle or
the email you send to a co-worker is private and unintelligible to anyone else.
However, in the brave new world as it currently is being designed, the feds
will also be able to decode every digital signal the Clipper chip scrambles.
Consequently, drug kingpins, mafiosi, and anyone else requiring secure
communications will have it (real data encryption is cheap and relatively easy
to implement), while the remaining information consumers will have Big Brother
to contend with.
