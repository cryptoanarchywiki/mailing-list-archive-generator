I just want to chime in that telnet{,d} clients are available that do
encrypt every packet, built upon Kerberos v5 (and the GSSAPI) for key
management.  There are even libraries that sit on top of sockets with
the same interface and do the encryption (and therefore the implicit
authentication) of every packet.

I'm sure Perry knew this, but I'm also sure others didn't.  I'm afraid
I don't have any pointers at the moment (though I know that they are
in use in some parts of CMU), and unless your need is urgent
and you already use kerberos you should just wait for the new swIPe.
