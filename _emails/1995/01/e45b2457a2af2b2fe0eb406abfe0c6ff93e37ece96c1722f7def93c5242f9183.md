Grady Ward wrote an article on implementing something like TEMPEST
("something like" means that it was not derived from classified
documents).  I can't seem to find my copy of his text and it doesn't 
appear anymore at netcom:/ftp/pub/gr/grady...Anyyone have a pointer
to this?

This article is definitely the most practical and comprehensive that
I've seen on this subject.
