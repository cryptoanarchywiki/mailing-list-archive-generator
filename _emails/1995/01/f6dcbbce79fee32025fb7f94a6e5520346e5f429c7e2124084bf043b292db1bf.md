I just saw a story go by on the dow jones wire saying that AT&T had
developed a "comprehensive security system for commercial information
services". It is said to be an encryption system developed jointly by
Bell Labs and VLSI, and its intedned for set-top boxes and "the
internet". VLSI was one of the contractors on Clipper. Anyone know if
this is an "escrowed" system? Anyone know any other details?
