At the RSA conference, I came across an interesting-looking tome
called _Federal Certification Authority Liability and Policy: Law and
Policy of Certificate-Based Public Key and Digital Signatures_.  It
seems that we can obtain this thing from NIST for a modest fee of $61,
but I'm wondering if there might be an online version around
somewhere.  Does anyone know?
