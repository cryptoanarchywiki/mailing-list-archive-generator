While this may be possible, the argument that someone actively tried to
remain uninformed about something "dangerous" or potentially "illegal"
doesn't seem like a particularly strong defense. Someone with proper
credentials might want to comment on whether intentional ignorance is
sufficient to avoid culpability.
