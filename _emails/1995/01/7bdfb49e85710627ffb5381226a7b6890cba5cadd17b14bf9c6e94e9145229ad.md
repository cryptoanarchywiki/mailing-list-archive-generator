Subject: Remailer in a Box transcript

	The remailer created with the following transcript was created
for test purposes only. It is not to be used as a remailer.

infinity:infinity/rtest 3:02pm [10] > /usr/local/lib/boxed-remailer/install_remail 
Installation version 1.1
Making remail dir
Preparing forward file
You have the option of running a hidden remailer. If you are running
a hidden remailer mail to your remailer gets auto-forwarded to another
remailer where it is processed. That way your remailer is less likely
to come under attack because no one gets anonymous mail directly
from your remailer.
Would you like to run a 'hidden' remailer? [N]/y n
Your personal address would be a good thing to put in Complaints-To:
What should be put in the Complaints-To: header? Remailer Operator <sameer@c2.org>
Sending anon mail to self in a self-test
Remailer test complete
Would you like to subscribe to the remailer-operators@c2.org list? [Y]/n n
Ok.. done creating the anonymous remailer
Your old .forward file (if it existed) is now in .forward.0
Run "remailer_remove" (It will be installed in /home/infinity/rtest/bin)
To erase the remailer and restore your old .forward file
Installing remailer_remove in /home/infinity/rtest/bin
Now you have to create a PGP key for the remailer
Make sure you choose a key appropriate to a remailer
"Anon Remailer <rtest@c2.org>" would make a good keyid.
Please choose a key length of less than 1024 bits. Otherwise
the remailer will produce too much load on the system.

Pretty Good Privacy(tm) 2.6.2 - Public-key encryption for the masses.

Current time: 1995/01/21 23:03 GMT
Pick your RSA key size:
    1)   512 bits- Low commercial grade, fast but less secure
    2)   768 bits- High commercial grade, medium speed, good security
    3)  1024 bits- "Military" grade, slow, highest security
Choose 1, 2, or 3, or enter desired number of bits: 1
Generating an RSA key with a 512-bit modulus.

You need a user ID for your public key.  The desired form for this
user ID is your name, followed by your E-mail address enclosed in
<angle brackets>, if you have an E-mail address.
For example:  John Q. Smith <12345.6789@compuserve.com>
Enter a user ID for your public key: 
Anon Remailer <rtest@c2.org>

You need a pass phrase to protect your RSA secret key.
Your pass phrase can be any sentence or phrase and may have many
words, spaces, punctuation, or any other printable characters.

Enter pass phrase: 
Enter same pass phrase again: 
Note that key generation is a lengthy process.

We need to generate 464 random bits.  This is done by measuring the
time intervals between your keystrokes.  Please enter some random text
on your keyboard until you hear the beep:
   0 * -Enough, thank you.
...**** .**** 
Key generation completed.
What did you name your remailer? Anon Remailer <rtest@c2.org>
What was the passphrase you chose? key
Running a self-test of PGP
Ran self-test of PGP

VERY IMPORTANT DO NOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION LIGHTLY
**************************************************
**************************************************
        Would you like to send the key that you generated for the
anonymous remailer sent to the remailer operators list? This means
that your remailer will be publically announced to the world. Make
sure that the UserID you chose is of a form reasonable for a remailer,
such as "Joe's Remailer <joe@c2.org>", or things could be a bit
messy.  Do not answer this question lightly.
Would you like to send your key to the list? [N]/y n
