The problem here is that the news transport mechanism is not
particularly resistant to arbitrary text being posted by a user.
Newsreaders can check for forged "From:" or "Sender:" lines, but
newsreaders then call shell scripts like inews and injnews to
process their material.  Users can call these scripts directly
and bypass any checks by the newsreader.  None of this requires
any special privs, and only the lowest level of the news
transport mechanism, relaynews, requires set-user-id netnews to
function.

The latest version of Tin does check for forged "From:" lines,
but the version Netcom runs allows anything to be posted.

Fudging the lower levels of the news transport mechanism to check
"From:" and "Sender:" lines can mess up other things, since
processes may need to inject news into the news stream which they
themselves did not author.

One solution to the problem is to have a secure level of the news
transport mechanism add an "Originator:" line to every message
which it handles. This will identify users attempting forgeries,
and will not require munging of an existing header line.
