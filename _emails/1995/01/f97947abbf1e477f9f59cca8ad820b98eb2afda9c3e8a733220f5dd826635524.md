I'll point out that insurance companies have typically taken on this
role, being at risk in these instances. "Underwriters Laboratories"
work with electrical safety is a real world example in which this
actually happened.

However, could we please take this discussion to someplace like
talk.politics.libertarian? The mere fact that I agree with the point
doesn't mean that I have an interest in seeing the only place for
cypherpunk discussion taken over by discussion of the evils of
government.
