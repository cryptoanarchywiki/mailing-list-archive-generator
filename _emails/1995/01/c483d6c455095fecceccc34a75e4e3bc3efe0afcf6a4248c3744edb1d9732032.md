Another book that has not been mentioned is "Alan Turing the Enigma" by
Andrew Hodges.  It gives, what I think, is a good analysis of Turing's
work, alot of which is still classified, what role Hut 6 played (theater 
traffic analysis, bombe development, and other projects after Hut 6) , and 
his subquent role in the development computing.

Hodges does a good job of putting Turing in historical and 
mathematical/cryptological perspective.

Alas, like some of the books that are sugguested, it is recently out of 
print ( look for it in the remainder/used book stores).
