It just gets worse and worse.

James, the debugging environment I've been referring to, and the product
I've been debugging is written in C++.  Let me be perfectly clear, here:

The product is an embedded processor.
I'm running a development environment on a Sun workstation.
The code running on the processor is written in C++.
The debugger is a symbolic debugger, and it can do breakpoints on lines of
code, displays of expressions involving symbolic names, and all of the other
points about debuggers that I recall you making.
The code uses all C++ features quite heavily.
There is no C or C++ interpretation involved.
The environment is freely available.
