A paratrooper girl named Christina, had just finished paratrooper
school at  Ft. Bragg. She was headed to Mpls, right around Hallowween.
Then we didn't hear from her for almost a month. Then came the Panama,
troop action, over the Haitian refugees. She didn't get picked, so they
let her come to Mpls, finally. If something goes quiet, you can be sure
something's up. I'd start betting on a Cuban thing first, as Castro
isn't getting any younger. The  U.S. needs the insurgent people in
Cuba rather than having them over here. That's my "guess".
