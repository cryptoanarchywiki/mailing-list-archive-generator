Perhaps it will become "Internetpol"?

Seriously, there is considerable danger that the growing chorus of
alarmist nonsense about the Net being used for child porn, for snuff
films, for weapons secrets deals, etc., will result in the U.S.
Net.Cops linking up with their European and Asian associates.

The recent stuff on "international key escrow," a la the conference
last September, is worrisome.

(I don't think they can win, of course, but any accleration of their
efforts is cause for increased vigilance.)
