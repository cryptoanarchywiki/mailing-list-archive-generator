Message size can best be handled by using a remailer which uses messages
which never change size. Mixmaster is now ready for testing.
It still does not run on Linux or FreeBSD. I don't know what else it does
run on. It works great on Sun machines with gcc.

Since it is export restricted, send me mail and I will send you the name of
the hidden directory to get the file.
