My PGP based time stamping service is back online.  I took it 
down a while ago thinking the folks at notary.com (Digital 
Time-Stamp, Inc.) were going to release their commercial 
time stamping product soon (it uses a more elegant protocol that
doesn't require trust in the time stamper, but the algorithm
is patented).  But I haven't heard anything from them 
in a while.

Anyway, it is now running as the following procmail recipe:

:0 w
* ^Subject: Time Stamp This Mail
{
PGPPASS=whateveryourpassphraseis
:0 c w
| (lockfile timestamp.lock ; pgp -fast +batchmode +force +verbose=0 \
+clearsig=off) > timestamp.out
 
:0 a h
| (formail -r -i 'Subject: Time Stamp Output';cat timestamp.out) | \
($SENDMAIL -t ;rm -f timestamp.lock)
}

To use it, just send whatever you need time stamped to me with 
the subject "time stamp this mail".

BTW, can a procmail expert explain to me why the locallockfile 
mechanism doesn't work with this recipe?  If I use :0 w : as 
the first line, procmail will happily ignore the locallockfile 
flag and proceed to munge up timestamp.out, so I have to do 
the filelocking manually.
