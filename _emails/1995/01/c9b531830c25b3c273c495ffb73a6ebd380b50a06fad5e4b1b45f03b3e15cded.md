I also have an infobot on pgp-faq@hks.net.  Sending mail there will get
you a fast autoresponse with a reasonably recent version of the same
FAQ.

And, I'll remind everyone that we need volunteers for the pgp-help mailing
list (Dave's on it).  It's important that we be able to identify what the
worst barriers to PGP use are and the best way to do that is to answer
folks' questions.  Send mail to pgp-help-request@hks.net to be added.

Thanks,
