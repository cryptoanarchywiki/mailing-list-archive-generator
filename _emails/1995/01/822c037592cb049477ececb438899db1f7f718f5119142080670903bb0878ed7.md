That's okay.  So's my GUCAPI code (suggestions of a better name are
quite welcome.  I'm considering changing the name to the Hastur Crypto
Toolkit, purely on aesthetics).

BTW, pointers to public domain code for each of these ciphers/hashes would
be reatly appreciated.  The crypto part of the library is really going to
just be a collection of what's already available from elsewhere; the
main work is in genericizing the IO and the key management functions and
in making life difficult for people who don't follow the interface
properly.  Other than that, the only other real work is getting a reasonably
portable source of random numbers working as a default random source.

I'll also be distributing an ITAR-friendly "bones" version with instructions
on how to add ciphers.  Are PRNGs like BBS covered by ITAR?
