Heard on the news today that they arrested a plumber and are holding
him in lieu of $50,000 bail.

He used a PC to crack into the phone system and set up 'Ultra' call
forwarding which forwarded calls to other plumbers businesses to his.
He then took the calls and told the callers that his company was
covering for the one they actually called.

Personal opinion: while I think the guy did steal business from the
other firms, they authorities are trying to find the customers he
'defrauded'.  If they were happy with the work, I don't think they
were actually defrauded.  The other companies did lose income and
I think he should be prosecuted for that, but $50,000 bail seems a
little excessive given the crime.
End Personal opinion.
