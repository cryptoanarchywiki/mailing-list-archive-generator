I've written an applescript for using the cypherpunks-style anon remailers
with Eudora for the macintosh.
It will take a message in Eudora, and construct a chain with MacPGP for
encryption, through remailers you've specified, and then deposit it back in
Eudora for sending.
There are still several features I'd like to add to it, but it's quite
useable in it's present incarnation.
You need a scriptable version of MacPGP, scriptable version of Eudora, and
some sundry scripting additions which are listed (with URLs) in the docs.

Send email if you'd like a copy, and I'll mail you a binhex'd copy. I don't
want it on any archive sites yet, because it's not really done, or fully
beta tested for bugs.  (so let that be a warning to you, too.)
