Kevin,

FYI, I keep the most recent version of Mike Johnson's excellent guide on
where to find PGP in:

  ftp.netcom.com:/pub/dd/ddt/crypto/crypto_info/where_is_pgp?.txt

This is a plain text file, but (for Mac users) the file:

  ftp.netcom.com:/pub/dd/ddt/crypto/crypto_info/where_is_pgp?.txt.sea.bin

is a self-expanding Mac archive (faster transfer time). There're some other
informational files in that dir, and any cpunks who know of a
quintessential PGP info file is encouraged to let me know so I can post it
there. Remember, this "archive" is oriented toward new PGP users who need
friendly information on why/how/who/where/when etc.

If you're in the US or Canada, you can also find the most up-to-date
version of the MacPGP application in this directory:

  ftp.netcom.com:/pub/dd/ddt/crypto/NOT_FOR_EXPORT

Be sure to read the ReadMe files detailing the export restrictions, since
transfer of this software to a system or machine outside of the US or
Canada is strictly verboten.

Send email to <pgp-questions@lsd.com> if you have further questions.

   dave
