The increase in strength, if each cypher was roughly equal,
is merely order n, where n is the number of cyphers.

If, as is likely, one of the cyphers required a billionfold
less power to break than the others, you have decreased
strength by an enormous factor.  

The way to increase strength is to use a cypher, such
as IDEA, which has a large key.  Key size will increase
strength by a factor of billions, not a factor of n.

Current key sizes are such that computationally expensive
attacks do not work on symmetric cyphers.  An attack has to 
be clever.
