It works on so many levels, as well 
- hiding encrypted bits in the low-order bits of pixel color values
- representing data in the colored spots on a Seurat impressionist work
	or the lines and splotches on a Jackson Pollack imitation
- wondering what the artist _really meant_ by a given figure :-)

It also may be a good way to nag us into doing stealthy versions
of PGP and other cryptosystem headers - steganography is less useful
when the encrypted message always starts off with
- ----- BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED FILE 
and has the recipient's keyid readily findable as well.
