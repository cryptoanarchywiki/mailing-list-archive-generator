This is not exactly what secure edit does. It hashes in the following
manner to generate a session key:

MD5 [ (128-bit salt) MD5[passphrase] 0 MD5[passphrase] 1 MD5[passphrase] 2 ... ]
to get the session key. The 0, 1, 2 is a single byte. So there is only one
level of nesting of the hashes. This is actually a common and well-regarded
technique for increasing the security of weak passphrases.
