T.C. May, so eloquently  waxed:

The squeals of the net.cops were impressive to behold! Demands to
Netcom that I be expelled from the Net, that the "Child Welfare
Agents" would soon be breaking down my doors, etc. 

Nobody spotted the message. After several days, I "let the truth be
told," which of course enraged others. 

I thought this digression might be amusing to some.
