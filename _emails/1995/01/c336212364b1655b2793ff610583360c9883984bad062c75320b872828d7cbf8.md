class of users are to vague and I fear I may kill something I want to 
read.  I have never came toa a point where i knew all posts from such and 
site site or class of users was not worth my time, but I have run across 
dozens of individuals who I realized said nothing I wanted to waste a "d" 
or "n" keystroke on.

Bullshit, you sound like Doctress fuckin Nuetopia.  Kill files are not 
censorship at all, do you pay attention to everythign that coems your 
way?  Do you read every last scrap of paper people put in front of you?  
Do you go out and buy every fuckin perdiodical just in case there is an 
article in them you want, or are you intelligent enough to make 
judgemnets to conserve your time and sanity by not wasting your time on 
information resources you know will bring nothing too you.  If I really 
wanted to censr or kill you Carol, and not simply avoid having to "d" 
thru a good thrity messages I don't want to read, you wouldn't be 
replying to this at all dear.

So far your posts have told me nothing I didnt already know.  Damn Carol, 
I was on your side until you started to REALLY SPAM.


i want to know everything          http://www.mcs.com/~nesta/home.html
i want to be everywhere                     Nesta's Home Page        
i want to fuck everyone in the world               &
i want to do something that matters         /-/ a s t e zine
