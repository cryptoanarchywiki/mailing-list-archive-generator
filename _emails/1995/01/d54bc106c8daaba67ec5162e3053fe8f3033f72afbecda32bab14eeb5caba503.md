Although the FBI only have juristiction within the US, it is quite possible
that they would have files containing information about non-US nationals
if they were involved (perhaps even peripherally) in domestic FBI
investigations.

I wonder what would happen if a non-US citizen logged an FOI request?
Has anyone ever tried?
