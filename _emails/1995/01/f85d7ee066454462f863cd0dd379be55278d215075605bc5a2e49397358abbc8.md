(I'm assuming you're being sarcastic.)

I had agreed with Perry's statement when I saw it.  I've taught classes in both
DOS and UNIX.  Whenever I've taught people who knew next to nothing about
computers, I found people were able to attain a basic "user" sort of skill
level in about the same amount of time with about the same difficulty when 
learning either.

If you're going to be snotty and sarcastic, the least you could do is provide
a counter-example, to give us something to discuss.  After you showed your
heinie (IMHO) in your comments about operating system security the other day.
I'd think you'd have lost credibility to gain.  I mean, I was tempted to
make a comment to you much like the one you made to Perry, but I didn't think
it was worth the time.
