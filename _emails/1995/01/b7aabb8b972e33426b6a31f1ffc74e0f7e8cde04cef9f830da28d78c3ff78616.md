| 	I have literally hundreds of messages archived from the CP list of
| several months back where Eric Hughes repeatedly states that reordering,
| not latency, is the key. Reordering of a sufficient magnitude will
| introduce latency inherently. Otherwise you are still vulnerable to 
| traffic analysis (which is an art, not a science, remember).

	Are you sure TA is still an art?  The NSA has (presumably)
spent thousands of man years on the problem.  Hal, Wei Dai and others
have done some very good work.  While I've only skimmed the surface of
it, its clear that clever statistical work comprises a lot of TA.  It
may be that the FBI has a couple of Suns handling the whole remailer
network right now.

	Also, if anyone wants to lok at the archives, the best thread
is subject reordering vs. latency.
