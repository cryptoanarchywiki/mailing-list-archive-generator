Has anyone seen Monty Python's Life of Brian.....  DO I hear a parallelism???
Something to the effect of "The PEople's Judean Front", "The Popular 
People's Front", and it goes on an on....

HOw about for the modern approach.... CDT, EFF, CPSR, Cypherpunks... Do I 
hear more.. Or are we so split up that we can't agree on our common goal....
