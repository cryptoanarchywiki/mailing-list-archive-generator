Just as healthy paranoia, that's worth persuing.
But I bet the author didn't know what they was talking about. 
 
# Another quote from the article posted elsewhere said that, "PGP, which is

DH uses "discrete log" as the hard problem, and very straightforward
mathematics.

RSA uses "factoring" as the hard problem, and a very clever back door.

How do you decide if one is based on the other?

# public-key technology with Diffie-Hellman public-key in particular, which
# (as I understand it) is not particularly secure.

It's still up in the air, isn't it, whether the discrete log or 
factoring is the harder to crack.   My intuition is they're the
same hard.

I know of no problem with DH that RSA doesn't have similar problems.
