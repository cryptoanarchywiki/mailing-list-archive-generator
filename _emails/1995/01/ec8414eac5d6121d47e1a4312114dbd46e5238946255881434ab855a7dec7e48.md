I'd have replied in private mail, but Mr. Embarassing here can't be
reached by mail...

Haven't found a bug in find since '85.

Yup. Shell scripts as the startup scripts for the machine are really
hard to understand. The simple list of newsgroup names to configure
the news readers are impossible to grok, too. Not.

And of course, DOS has never added options to new versions of the system.

Yup. Recently, I ported about 80,000 lines of code in a day. It wasn't
much of a challenge -- because I knew how to program, of course. I had
to hack some compatibility libraries, and it took about another day
and a half to back-patch the original sources so that the program
compiled without problems on both architectures.

Thats because its fully automated. Would you prefer to do the job by hand?

Remember, Unix handles things that PCs never even dreamed of -- like
endianness considerations, which you don't get if you are chained by
the ankle to one shitty processor.

I've never seen that, but then again I'm just on drugs. Naturally, of
course, no DOS programs have ever crapped out.

The shell doesn't accept regular expression syntax, so this shouldn't
be the least bit suprising.

Not at all true -- you can use skill, or if a process is a current job
you can do stuff in most shells like

kill %procname

So buy it precompiled. Lots of people sell it that way. I can't
imagine that Windows would be easy to install if you got it in source
form.
