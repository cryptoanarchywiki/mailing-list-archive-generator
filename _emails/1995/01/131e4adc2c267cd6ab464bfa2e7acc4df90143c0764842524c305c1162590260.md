    I recall the event in sci.crypt, though not the names involved.
    The article in TJOAUC is a "FAQ" by someone named Neil Johnson
    (njj@pokey.mc.com) who thanks David Colston and Charlie Merritt
    "the authors" for sharing info...

    The FAQ states boldly:
    "CS uses QPK Quick Public Keys by David Colston.  This public
    key system has been reviewed by Whit Diffie, Gus Simmons (Sandia
    Labs), and posted on sci.crypt."

    and on the next page:
    "8. Is it really secure? You, decide!

    Well, the public keys system used by Call Security, QPK
    (Quick Public Keys) by Dave Colston has survived peer review.
    This is good"

    Are these statements false?  Should someone call for a retraction?
