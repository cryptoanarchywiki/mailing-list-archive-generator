Around here (in the Twin Cities) one can get a dedicated connection for
$100/month without any startup fees.  And of course one can set up a local
network and use the machine with the modem link as a router.

Having one of these dedicated lines, I'd be happy to host remailer-boxes at
my site.  Ideally, they'll be small & only require a network cable and a
power cord.  

I'm also willing to seriously consider initiating remailer-accounts on my
machine.  If you'd be interested in a remailer account, drop me a line.
