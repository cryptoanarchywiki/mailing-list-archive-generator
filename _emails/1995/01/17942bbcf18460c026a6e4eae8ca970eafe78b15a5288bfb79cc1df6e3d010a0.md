the president can do just about anything he wants with an executive
order. of course if he did certain things he would be likely to get
impeached, or challenged in the courts.

theoretically, what with being commander in chief of the armed forces,
the president can do anything he wants up to and including the declaration
of martial law.

I don't expect that to happen this year.
