  Alot of the banks in the US are now offering these cards for use with 
checking accounts.

  When a charge is made to the card it is subtracted from the balance 
until midnight? of that night. If the actual charge does not come in to 
the bank, the amount is then added back to the balance. (This was learned 
thru my GF who had some trouble with her card -- forgot to write down a 
couple of transactions and ended up at zero).

  I think they should. If they would is another matter. It would be 
similar to having a 'secret' Swiss bank account that can be accessed from 
anywhere in the world, converted to cash at cash machines, transferred to 
others, etc.

  I like the idea of an anonymous Visa better than some sort of new 
net-bank because it is already established, the mechanism for transfer is 
already in place, and for the most part de-bugged.

  If there was an Anonymous Visa debit card I'd defiantly go for it. It 
would certainly keep those marketing types from tracking my spending 
patterns.
