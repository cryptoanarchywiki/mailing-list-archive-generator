First, I want to know how Rishab, in India, gets "Wired" so early (or
why I, right next to Silicon Valley, get it so late). He's mentioned
the February issue twice now, and all I have is the January "White
Album."

Second, I didn't know Lance Rose was a lawyer, or even a "SysLawyer"
(?). When I met him a couple of years ago, he'd just gotten out of
jail and was working for the satellite Usenet distribution company
(whose name I don't recall, and who I've heard less of than I might've
expected to, subjunctively speaking).

In any case, there a zillion odd opinions on the Net of a Million
Lies. Most of them will vanish without a trace. That's comforting.
