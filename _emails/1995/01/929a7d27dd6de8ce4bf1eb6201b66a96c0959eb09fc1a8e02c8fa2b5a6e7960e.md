I would put her in my killfile, but I don't know if vms has a kill
file capibility.  I use my unix accounts for important email, and
do not want to have to sift through the volume I get from the cypherpunks.

Otherwise, given that the percentage of interesting posts is going down
as a result of carrolann (and perhaps me too now), I think having an
elite group capable of banning certain people is perfectly ethical.
