Ubiquitous remailing -- having a significant portion of the net population
bouncing around randomly fluctuating encrypted traffic as background noise -- 
should help to cover both remailers and data havens. It would be nice to
have more people firing off occasional encrypted stuff to muddy the waters.
(Picture yourself in Bridge over the River Kwai if it helps ;)
