Paul, I think we're after two different objectives here. You want Alice to
be sure that Dave can't read her file; I want Dave to be sure that he can't
read Alice's files.

Alice should worry only about her privacy: if she doesn't want Dave to know
what she's sending, she should encrypt her file in a way that Dave cannot
break.

Dave certainly doesn't want to know what Alice is sending him, because he
might have to answer to a Grand Jury if he did. My protocal makes it very
difficult for Dave to gain any useful knowledge about Alice's files. Dave
does this not as a courtesy to Alice, but for those three wonderful
letters, CYA.

Of course, any data haven worth paying for will offer lots of neat
features, like PGP support, anonymous file drops, and all other sorts of
goodies. But that does little good if Alice can trick Dave into selling
child pornography.

Douglass Floyd asked, "How do I know if [be certain that] it's encrypted?"
Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure the answer is, "You decrypt it." My protocol
at least delays the decryption until it's [hopefully] too late to matter.
