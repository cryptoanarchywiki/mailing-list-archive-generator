From: "Richard F. Dutcher"

What's your point?  Got a principle that *hasn't* been
used/abused?
..................................................

The original statement I made was in response to Richard Moore, who was 
wondering out loud why someone else on this list was "on the wrong 
side";   I remarked in essence that he likewise is seemingly on that 
side, as cryptography, in its development, is designed to serve the 
purposes of individuals in disproportion to governmental control over it.

I'm not assuming that "privacy and protection from arbitrary power are 
solely libertarian concerns" either.   Yet I don't need to "check out 
the ACLU and Amnesty International ..." to understand the many 
possibilities and dangers.

My remarks were intended to indicate that it isn't necessary to inspect 
the varying degrees of comparative corruption or betterment in any of 
the institutions which these political arguments encourage;  if you 
understand full well the principle involved, or what it is that is 
"wrong", then it shouldn't be too difficult to see the similar 
impropriety wherever it becomes manifest.
