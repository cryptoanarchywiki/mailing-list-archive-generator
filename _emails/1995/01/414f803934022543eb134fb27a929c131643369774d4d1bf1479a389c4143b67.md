Extreme government leads to totalitarianism, not socialism.

Governments as a whole are seen to be "bad" because they invariably undermine
the right of the individual to make choices for themselves.

And why should they?  After all, property rights are founded on a belief in
scarcity, which is a total fear-based illusion.

And there are certain areas of society that this scares, and who are already
making steps to stop it and clamp down. Where do you think all the scare
stories about "kiddie porn" and such on the net are coming from?

The so-called "Third Wave" has nothing to do with government and everything to
do with the empowerment of the individual.  Some seem to not recognize that.

This has always been the case throughout history - the forces of dark, of
disinformation, have always attempted to keep true power from the hands of
the people.
