   The hardest part is getting approved for a merchant account.

I've tried.  Nathan is right.

   Also, as Paul pointed out, the requirement for reversibility applies to
   ANY credit-card-based service, not just FV.  This is NOT an option, it
   is required by law (reg Z).

But if you sell services or information, this is not a really big
problem.  You just say "fuck it, I got screwed", and you reverse the
charges.

And as for anonymity/privacy, if the business is doing a lot of other
transactions, and the remailer ones are mixed in, then who's to say
who's who?  Maybe it's time to remind people that there is no such
thing as perfect security, only varying degrees of such.
