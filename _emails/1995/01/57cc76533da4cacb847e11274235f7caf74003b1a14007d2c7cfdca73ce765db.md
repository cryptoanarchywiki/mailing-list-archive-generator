You can do a good job of anonymous remailing even on a system that
keeps email logs, if the system is otherwise trustable.
When mail comes in to your remailer, store it in a file (encrypted....).
Periodically take the files of stored messages, shuffle them,
and mail them out.  It's about the same behavior as doing the same
from your own box with eavesdroppers on your network, though
the traffic levels are a bit different if each remailer operator
on rahul.net gets identified separately instead of all the remailers
getting lumped together.  But if there are multiple remailers on
Rahul's machine, and if the syslogs don't log internal mail,
you could also forward some of the remailer traffic randomly
through other remailer-operators there.
