Yes, but... 
Presumably those who feel that they need remailer and are willing to put
out the effort to use one might also feel that they need a higher level of
security.  I suppose that my remark might be more accurately:
"mainly just documents the superiority of the 'everybody a remailer'
concept for TA purposes."  Of course, if the remailer-in-a-box isn't much
harder to use than PGP was two years ago, then maybe "everybody" will...

No?  Isn't the InterNet currently under a serious packet-spoofing attack?
Don't we expect Eve to be AKA NSA?  If I run a remailer, I want to know
that I'm not being lied to in the process.  That insistance might just save
the legal butt of the guy being spoofed, by demonstrating that the packet
did not in fact originate from the remailer.  Just because remailers are
legal doesn't mean that the govt won't still try to shut them down...

In this instance garbage is defined as cryptographic random.  If the
message has a length indicator in the clear, then Eve can read it.
(Remember, Eve runs snakoil@nsa.gov.)  Therefore, such a marker has to be
_inside_ the wrapper.  Given this, (that everything is PGP wrapped) there
is always the chance that PGP will compress a message, even one with
cryptographically strong bits in the end.  While compression can improve
protection, it is not likely to do so if the original message was already
PGPed.  Only "clear" messages, therefore, risk losing protection.  As you
note, such messages don't deserve as much help as opaque ones.

See below.  Basically, we don't want to be spoofed ourselves.  Bad
security for our systems.  Admittedly, this is probably not a real problem
today.  See my sig.

>

Sure it does.  If the whole thing is inside a PGP wrapper, then it is
secure.  "Only passing through the contents of a PGP block" is currently a
security measure that makes good sense.  But if you have two separate
blocks _inside_ an outer wrapper, you already have full security.  Strip
off the outside, find two more wrappers.  Strip the first, get remailing
instructions.  Attempt to strip the second.  Fail.  Attach second wrapper
to forwarded message.  Full security.

Alice signs her messages to the remailer because she doesn't want anyone
spoofing her use of the remailer.  If a message goes in at 00:00:00.01, 1
Jan, 2001 that is "From:" her, it is FROM her.  More of the same reasoning.
This key doesn't have to have anything to do with the key she uses with
Bob.  It is the one that she wants the general public to use for HER.

NoNoNoNoNoNoNo! ;) The key she includes is Bob's public key.  The same one
that is on the key servers.  This is so the message can be standard sized
for the final trip to Bob.  As we have noted, messages are quite vulnerable
at this stage.  If every message that Bob gets from Chaum "looks the same",
who is to say which is which?

Suppose you were using the remailer net.  Would you care to know that
someone was spoofing a node?  I would.  It would indicate that someone is
either hacking the system (probably no big deal), or that someone might be
shadowing a remailer.  That is, the remailer is no longer secure.  Spoofing
is a big deal on the net generally, and if we start being used a lot, we
will have to deal with it as well.  Why not now?

If the message length is world readable, it is world readable.  The super-
wrapping makes sure that it is not.  It also makes clear messages
indistinguishable from opaque ones inside the net.  See below.

Yes, but...  Breaking an overly large file makes it indistinguishable from
standard sized ones.  See below.

below:  (Couldn't resist ;-)

The point of "Uncling" insecure messages has nothing to do with improving
the security of the insecure messages.  I agree, as a good member of the
Libertarian-Christian wing of the Republican party (NYET!) that these folks
deserve snakeoil.  But we're _not_ doing it for them.  We're doing it for
Frank, who does everything right.  If Eve doesn't know anything we don't
have to tell her about Alice's messages, then she gains no free negative
information about Frank's.  Judging by the remailer stats, there are a lot
of messages traveling "in the clear." These messages currently do nothing
for those of us that do things right.  It's time that they do.

So I'm not encouraging Alice to trust Chaum.  I'm encouraging Chaum to give
Frank all the help he can.  Frank, who just blew the whistle on the
"Justice" Department.  Frank, who does everything right, and might even
stand out because he does.  Frank, the guy we are all really doing this
for.

To put it another way, if we really don't want centralized solutions, if no
one should trust any of us, if the users should provide all of their own
cover, then why are you running a remailer?  Let them telnet to port 25.
Let them do whatever.

Maybe that was too harsh.  I don't advocate holding people's hands.  What I
_do_ want to do is to provide the best service that we can.  Note that from
earlier and current work (thanks, guys!), we see that even if the remailer
net itself is completely secure, the sender and reciever can still be
traced with near-exponential speed.  

So our systems provide a delay in tracking of a couple of months.  Big
deal.  The TLAs routinely take years to build a serious case.  If we are
going to be any help to folks that _really_ need it, we have to extend the
black box all the way to people outside the net.  As you said, not everyone
will be remailers anytime soon.

So if I am trusting a remailer net, wouldn't it be nice to know that no one
but the ends can even think about compromising the message?  (Until one of
them does.)  Wouldn't it be nice to know if the ends were being shadowed?

As for signing intra-net traffic, suppose, at some time in the future, we
agree that we do, in fact, need them.  Will it be easier or harder to
implement then?

Actually, I did make this error when I first considered this, also.  We do
not hope for a short key.  In fact, we know that the key will be long, when
viewed in parts, as I now believe that it is.  We hope that the key will be
0 rich.  The chance of this just comes off of the binomial distribution,
which is not nearly so bad.  Sorry.  And a, say, 10% improvement above
expected allows a cooresponding length increase--which does something
_more_ than improve security by 10% ;)

Not at all.  We're not talking about anything as important as unix vs
windows.  You must be a better person than I.  I usually love shooting down
lame-brain ideas.  ;-)

See below.  I mean above.  I mean below:.  This is not, IMHO, a centralized
solution, as I see it.  As I see it, this is a _minimal_ solution to the
problem that today, our net is laughably easy to crack.  I assume that
anyone that wants to spoof will have a reason to do so.  I assume that if
the NSA/FBI/CIA/DEA/DIA/ATF wants to trace a message, they will bring the
full power of their systems to bear, including reading this list.

Anyone else?  Tim's usually pretty good at panning me. :-P  :-)
