Noyb asks if there are offline methods of IOU-token exchange...

  well, one way of doing it is LETS, the Local Exchange Trading System-- a
non-computerized way of exchanging value in a community. it doesn't
exactly use money. there are thousands of LETS's worldwide, i've never
used one and don't know how they work in practice, tho i'd like to find
out! they seem like a good idea. it seems like the ideas could be 
extended to the net-- there seems to be a synergy with digital 
signatures, etc.
   a good place to find info about LETS is: 

LETSystems - the Home Page
