Jeff's response is exactly what I was hoping for! The "Cypherpunks
distribution" version of Linux would be a great way to spread cheap
remailer technology on cheap Linux boxes. Hell, I might even augment
my Macs with one of these things!

This is what I'd expect....I just don't know the details.

A great idea. This could be the "remailer in a box" we've been talking
about for a long time. Could also include a package of security and
crypto utilities, etc. Sort of what the "Gnu" folks might do if they
were involved in crypto. (By "involved in crypto" I mean of course
Cypherpunks sorts of concerns, which Stallman seems to have not much
interest in, at least publically.)

Well, if I take the other side of the bet, that I *can't*, is that kosher?

Sounds very good to me.
