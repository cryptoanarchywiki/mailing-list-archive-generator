I understand what you are saying, what I am saying is the distinction is not
used in practice. The bbs operator in Cali. that was busted in Tennessee was
busted for delivering PORNOGRAPHY (not obscenity) to a minor (in short a 14
year olds account being operated by a oinkdroid.) If you can 'simply' ban
obscenity then why all the rucus? Simple, you can't ban it simply... or any
other way for that matter. As to your zoning restrictions, they change from
place to place and hence are not a hard and fast rule either. The bottem line
is that the distinction fostered by legal eagles is a straw man argument, it
is intended to distract from the real issue - freedom to do what  you want
unless you harm another or their property without their prior concent.

This test is a joke, if you apply it fairly then a man and his wife having
anal sex would qualify as obscene in many places (which it does in some states)
Also, the whole concept of community standards is unworkable. Whose community?
The reason so few  people get busted under the Miller test is that there really
are so few idiots out there who would fall for it.

The reason they want to regulate pornography is that it is a stepping stone to
a total ban. It is based on religous grounds and the issue really has little if
anything to do with Constitutional rights.
