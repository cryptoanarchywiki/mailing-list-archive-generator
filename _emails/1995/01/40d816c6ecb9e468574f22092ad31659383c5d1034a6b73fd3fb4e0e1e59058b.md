Electric Dreams #44 is on the futility of videoconferencing; e-mail focuses
and will reign supreme. Anonymous videoconferencing is touched upon. Tim May
would approve. #45, the latest, is on Boolean algebra and Being Analogue -
analogue VLSI, bio-chips, optical and quantum computing etc.

ObCypherpunk: we all _do_ realize, of course, that serious violations of
privacy will continue for some time to be in the _analogue_ domain - from
RF interception and laser eavesdropping to thumbscrews. Perhaps some solutions
lie there too - the quantum anti-interception communication idea for example.
And lead walls.
