Someone had posted a protocol scheme that would allow new remailers to
advertise their existence on a newsgroup, which would cause any number
of auto pinging "reputation" services to begin monitoring this new
remailer automatically.  Once reliability, etc., was established, the
reputation services would "add" this node to the remailernet.  Similar
actions would take place if a remailer just "went away".

Quality of service, features, etc., would be part of the advertisement,
and would result in a form of competition between remailers.  Similarly,
reputation services would have differing criteria for "blessing" a site,
which would result in a form of competition between the _reputation servers_
for a good reputation.

The key to this whole scheme is in the automation of the process.  Done
correctly, it would result in a self-organizing, self-healing ecology of
remailers, that would naturally gravitate toward providing the features
and services in most demand.

Yeah, sure.  Looks good on paper, anyway.  Lots of real-life hassles to 
work out, but it _probably_ could be made to work.
