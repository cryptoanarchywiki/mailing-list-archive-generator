Funny thing happened to me last night. I was talking to a guy who had seen
Fidelity's new WWW server (shhh! don't tell!) and it turns out he was the
guy who actually *had* bob.com. A third party approached him and asked him
if he wanted to sell the domain name. He did. He picked another domain
name, and last week someone called him if he wanted to sell his *new*
domain name. He said no, and they asked him if he would *rent* it to
them...

Go figure.

Cheers,

Eric, what'll you take for "remailer.net"? ;-).
