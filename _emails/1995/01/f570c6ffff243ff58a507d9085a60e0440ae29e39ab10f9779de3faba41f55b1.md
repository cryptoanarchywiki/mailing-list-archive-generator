	It would seem that Alice can protect Bob (or Bob can protect
himself) by engaging in multiple conversations through the mix.  I was
thinking earlier about the concept of bit buckets; people who agree to
get mail that they ignore.  Alice could, when talking to Bob, send
copies along the way to Fred, George, and Harry, each of whom would be
running a mailbot that sees the mail is not for them, and deletes it
(or, perhaps better, generates a response of encrypted nonsense to
flow through the mix for a while.)
