I've been on the Cypherpunk's mailing list for about half its lifetime,
am a technology consultant based in New Delhi, do a weekly column on
information society which has covered many of the issues you seem interested
in, and write for WIRED magazine. I am interested in law and ethics in
cyberspace, and would like to participate in your project, as long as it
is not primarily intended to culminate in a set of guidelines for legislation,
which I believe to be pointless. I'm including here some comments to your 
original announcement, which I only saw today.

Unfortunately, due to the way media works, we don't read of the benefits of
total anonymity to participants in sexual abuse groups, human rights activists
and many others. Going by what we read in the media, 93.5% of people on the 
Net are habitual child abusers, and 62% are nuclear-equipped narco-terrorists.

Or free it from the monopoly of large media organizations. Ninety-five percent
of the world's news is distributed by four agencies, who effectively shape our
view of the world at large, and decide for us the crises du jour. The Net,
_precisely_ because of its unregulated, bottom-up structure, allowed activists
to communicate during the revolution in Chiapas, Mexico; got international 
agencies to offer support for the massive earthquake in Latur India at once,
rather than wait for a Time magazine photo feature (which - surprise! - was
on Somalia just days before the world suddenly took notice of _that_ problem).

The commitment to freedom of expression, in _any form whatsoever_ including
the anonymous, is arguably the cause for much of the economic and technological
power of the US. It is a matter for concern that, rather than help spread
this freedom to the rest of the world (as is inevitable _if_ the Internet
continues not to be 'governed'), many in and out of government are attempting
to clamp down, out of an almost primeval fear of Digital Evil that stems from
ignorance of wider issues.

On the contrary, the 'current state of anarchy' has largely been responsible
for advancements in US research for the two decades since the Internet was
born. What is needed, perhaps, is a dialogue to improve understanding among
'society at large' of a community that is, though at present largly composed 
of technology professionals or academics, an example of multicultural and 
multinational cooperation and tolerance that would be nice to see in, say,
Los Angeles, or elsewhere in the 'real world'.
