I agree that it's a bit much to expect the remailer operator to heroically
perform beyond what any of us would do in the same lonely spot under
duress. 
 
Tim has written recently on another list that the USG grabs enemies in
other domains when the national interests are at stake -- the 800-pounder
can define any of its actions legal, or to hell with legal niceties as the
Beast opts, the picky lawyers can sort it out later, or never. 
 
Does not Duncan and others have wisdom on this:  Don't roll over out of
ignorance and faint-heartedness, but do carefully protect your keister,
with feet-on-ground planning, mercury-technology and out-wits.  Watch for
signs of sneak attack through the guy being squeezed next door, or by a
cahoots-machine zipping psy-war toot-alarms to foster fearful quiescence. 
 
Some warning examples may be in the offing in the rising heat of dreaded
horse-threats to civil society.  If so, some will be arranged by
provocateurs like past G-guy tricks. 
 
So it goes.  So what.  Nesta said, it's fun to lance swollen infected
over-controlling heads.
