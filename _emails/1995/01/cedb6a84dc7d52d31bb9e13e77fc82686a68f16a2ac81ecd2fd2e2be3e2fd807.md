    Seen on comp.society.privacy.  This document was obtained
    by an FOIA suit by EPIC. I ftp'd from the cpsr.org but even
    at 2:30 a.m. PST the 315 Kbytes took an excruciating 481 seconds.

    For those on netcom its on /ftp/pub/ba/bart easily available,
    if others can get through to ftp.netcom.com at least the
    transfer might be faster than cpsr.

    Encrypted information is dealt with on pps 54-55 in particular.
    I'll leave conclusions to our lawyerly types.
