 > SCOPE
 > 
 > The advance of computer and telecommunications technologies holds 
 > great promise for individuals and society. From convenience for 
 > consumers and efficiency in commerce to improved public health and 
 > safety and increased participation in democratic institutions, 
 > these technologies can fundamentally transform our lives.
 > 
 > At the same time these technologies pose threats to the ideals of 
 > a free and open society. Personal privacy is increasingly at risk 
 > from invasion by high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping. The 
 > myriad databases containing personal information maintained in the 
 > public and private sectors expose private life to constant scrutiny. 
 > 
 > Technological advances also enable new forms of illegal activity, 
 > posing new problems for legal and law enforcement officials and 
 > challenging the very definitions of crime and civil liberties. But 
 > technologies used to combat these crimes can threaten the 
 > traditional barriers between the individual and the state.
 > 
 > Even such fundamental notions as speech, assembly and property are 
 > being transformed by these technologies, throwing into question 
 > the basic Constitutional protections that have guarded them. 
 > Similarly, information knows no borders; as the scope of economies 
 > becomes global and as networked communities transcend 
 > international boundaries, ways must be found to reconcile 
 > competing political, social and economic interests in the digital 
 > domain.
 > 
 > The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will 
 > assemble experts, advocates and interested people from a broad 
 > spectrum of disciplines and backgrounds in a balanced public forum 
 > to address the impact of computer and telecommunications 
 > technologies on freedom and privacy in society. Participants will 
 > include people from the fields of computer science, law, business, 
 > research, information, library science, health, public policy, 
 > government, law enforcement, public advocacy and many others.
 >

 >
