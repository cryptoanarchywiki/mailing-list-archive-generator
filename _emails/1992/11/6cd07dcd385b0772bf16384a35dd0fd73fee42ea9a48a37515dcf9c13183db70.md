re: why remailers aren't as exciting as RNG's.

Well, remailers are working, admittedly a bit clunky at the moment,
and RNGs being talked about aren't. And we're primarily hackers. Once
something's working, it's less interesting, no? :-)

The next step for remailers is to make them actually *usable*,
routinely. Their current status is no fault of the implementors, it's
a first pass and a test bed (I ain't complaining!)

I just don't think it's a big secret, nor a big problem. Development
is always slow and boring... :-)
