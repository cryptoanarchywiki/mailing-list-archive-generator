This was originally addressed to Phillip Zimmermann.
Thank you for writting PGP. I have not run it on my Mac yet because my version
of Stuffit is 2.0 which deems the PGP.sit file to advanced. I resist
the incentives of compression program authors to produce frequent incompatible
updates which cost money and delay for little apparent advantage.
Compact pro is a shareware program that produces self expanding archives
which presume no pre installed decompressor. It is available by ftp at
sumex-aim.stanford.edu
info-mac.util.compact-pro-133.hqx
You may forward this to whomever does the Mac version
or send me his email address.
 
What I really am writting you about is to suggest that if you wrote "another"
program compatible with PGP under a PFP license that I would pay at least $50
for it. I might pay more depending on my experience with the free version.
I would accept delivery by email.
