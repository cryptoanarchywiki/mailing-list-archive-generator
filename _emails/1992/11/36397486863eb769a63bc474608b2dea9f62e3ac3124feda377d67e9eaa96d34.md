    After reading the details of that (formerly) secret back-room
    agreement between NSA and SPA, I don't think I'll *ever* trust a
    commercial encryption package, especially one for which source
    code is unavailable for scrutiny.
 
Could Phil or anyone give more details about that agreement and/or
where one could read more about it?
