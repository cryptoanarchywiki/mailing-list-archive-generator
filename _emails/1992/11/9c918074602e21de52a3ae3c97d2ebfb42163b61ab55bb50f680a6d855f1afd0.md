Maybe I'm being crypto-dense, but why would individual Powerbook 100
users care so much about generating the bits in the volumes that a
hardware-based RNG is designed to supply?

For filling a CD-ROM (600 MB) with good random bits, I can see the
need for a back-biased diode source (such as Tony Patti's widget), but
such filling of a CD-ROM presumes a fair amount of other stuff, like
the CD-ROM burners, etc. I can't imagine a PB 100 user, and I'm one of
them, developing OTPs on CD-ROMs on the PowerBook.

For generating PGP keys, the keyboard timing methods work quite well,
as several folks have pointed out.

Maybe for some of the dynamic key generation applications that will be
appearing in the next couple of years such a hardware RNG will be
useful (so that the bits can be generated in the absence of a human
operator, and at higher rates). But I don't see them needed
immediately, and certainly not on a PowerBook. (No insult to the
PowerBook, it's just that I can't see Eric Hughes' and Hal Finney's
remailer running on such a platform, for obvious reasons.)

Am I missing something?
