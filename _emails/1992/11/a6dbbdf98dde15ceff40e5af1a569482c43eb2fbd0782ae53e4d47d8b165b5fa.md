I'd like to chip in here, in my _very_ newbie way, that not 
everybody is running a unix system with the ability to pipe 
things between processes in so facile a manner. I access the net 
through a dial up from a MS-Dos machine running KA9Q software. My 
PGP is of the stand alone sort. I cannot easily get a new mailer 
to run on this system. Whatever protocol is decided upon, it 
would be useful if it were not too host-system specific.
