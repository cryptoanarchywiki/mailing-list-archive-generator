"...and just take the legal risks..."  Wellll, what is there to gain by
taking legal risks, as opposed to doing a research gig where we're trading
in pennies for fictitious goods & services...?  Please spell it out
explicitly; there would have to be a very significant advantage to convince
me to agree.  Like maybe that the govt is about to pull all cash out of
circulation and this is our last hope....
