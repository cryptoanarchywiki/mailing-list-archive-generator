Below is a copy of the email I received as a consequence of posting to the
Home Brew Digest.

Of course, the HBD is a digest, not a mail list ... but it occurs to me,
it is much harder to interfere with the operation of a Digest. The Digest
comes out once a day, it has ( usually ) a table of contents at the top,
and, if one received email telling where in the queue one's message was,
one could verify it by reading the Digest when next issued forth. As well
as discussing it with individuals separately via email, which provides a
redundancy of sorts to this verification process.

Eternal vigiliance and all that. Freedom is not a passive process !!
