So far,  I think this is the best idea,  and after checking out my
methodology and initial circuit design,  I see no reason why I cannot
go as high as 9600 baud.   Even the more inexpensive AD converters can
achieve that speed when we only want to use 8 bits.    I am toying 
around the idea for using an 8 bit AD converter,   then its just a
matter of clocking them out a UART.
