## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}From: wmo@rebma.rebma.mn.org (Bill O'Hanlon)
Date: Thu, 19 Nov 92 19:43:57 PST
To: cypherpunks@toad.com
Subject: Another remailer
Message-ID: <m0msP7R-0006QgC@rebma.rebma.mn.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


I've installed Eric's anonymous remailer scripts at remailer@rebma.mn.org.
Rebma is my home machine...  It's not right on the Internet, but it is a
Telebit connection away.  Feel free to use it as you see fit.  I don't
have Hal's PGP additions, but I am interested in running them.

Hal's messages said he hoped more people put up remailers so that they could be
chained together.  Sounded good to me.
