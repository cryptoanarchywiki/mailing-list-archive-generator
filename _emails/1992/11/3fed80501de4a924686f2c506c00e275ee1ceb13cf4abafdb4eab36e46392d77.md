An excellent suggestion.  Can you start writing such a thing? (This is
not a facetious request).  I imagine there will be two or three
strategies for approving a key, and if we write them up well, we will
be able to ask people which protocol they have engaged in:

1) Only people I know personally and whose keys I receive in person.

2...

n) Any key received throuhg any medium.

This could have lots of educational value.
