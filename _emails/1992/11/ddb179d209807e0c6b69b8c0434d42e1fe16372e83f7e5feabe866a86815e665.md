Perry is correct. Getting 10K or more bits per second from a
radioactive soure usually means it is close enough/strong enough to
"drift" the device to the point of radiation-induced permanent failure
in a matter of weeks or months (if not much sooner, but this is all so
dependent on exact calculations and lab experiments).

Tony Patti, editor of a small crypto journal and frequent commentator
on sci.crypt, is one of several folks who've designed thermal
noise-based RNGs. He's selling them, as I recall. I would _strongly_
advise anyone who's contemplating building and selling such a gizmo to
first see what the market has produced and whether or not it's
selling, etc.

A minor note: the bias between 0s and 1s (unequal distribution, for
example) is easily handled by considering pairs of numbers, with a "0
1" being called a "0" and a "1 0" being called a "1."
