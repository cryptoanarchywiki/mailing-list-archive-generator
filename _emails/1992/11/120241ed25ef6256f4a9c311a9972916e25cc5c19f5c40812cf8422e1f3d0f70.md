Does anyone have a copy?  Nyx seems to be down for the last couple
of days so I can't get it.  

Don't send it to me, I don't want to have 150 copies of this fairly
large document pile up in my mailbox overnight, just let me know if
you have it, and I will request ONE of you to send it.

Thanks.

Yanek, yanek@novavax.nova.edu
