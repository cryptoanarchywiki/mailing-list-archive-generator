Special Interest Group on Freedom, Privacy and Technology
A public forum co-sponsored by BMUG and CPSR/Berkeley
 
For those that need a brief break from Thanksgiving, the 
CPSR/BMUG Special Interest Group will explore cryptography
with a brief overview and discussion lead by George Gleason.
 
Gleason is founder of a telecommunications contracting
firm in Berkeley. He is also professionally involved in 
psychological research on interpersonal communication and 
state variables (i.e. perception, cognition, etc.).
 
Gleason's overview will be followed by a video taken from the
Second Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy in 
Washington DC last March. The video is entitled: "Who Holds 
the Keys? Cryptography & Control: National Security vs. 
Personal Privacy."
 
You are encouraged to join us on November 29, 1992 at 2:00 pm
for a look into cryptography and personal privacy.
 
The Special Interest Group's next meeting is Sunday, Nov. 29, 
1992, at 2:00 pm. The monthly meetings are free and open to the 
public. The group meets on the last Sunday of the month at the 
BMUG office, 2055 Center Street, Berkeley -- a half block from the 
Berkeley Bart station.
