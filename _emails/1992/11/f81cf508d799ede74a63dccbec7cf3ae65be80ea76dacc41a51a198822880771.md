I have a question regarding the ideas which have been circulating about
using CD ROMs as key storage.  How does one go about rapidly and effectively
erasing everything on a CD ROM?  The reason I ask is, in the case of OTPs
you want to cancel your key as it's used, to prevent accidental double-use
of key; and of course in any system you want to make sure that all your
crypto material can be wiped squeaky clean in the event of a barbarian
invasion.
