Hiya,
        About the MacPGP, isn't it possible to sort of write a script addon
to the various telecoms software?  What I mean is that when you start reading
mail, you click somewhere, and all input from the modem is translated direct
by the script so that you can read the plaintext.  But when you reply, you will
have to use the telecoms' editor and upload the text...
        Somewhat like that rot13 thing in news really (or the VMS implemantation
of it).
     Ciao.

-Tai
