Using the net, the 'banker' could easily be 'offshore' and not 
subject to US law in these matters. After all the internet 
reaches into Canada and obviously (from my point of view) to the 
UK.  I think a more real problem with anonymous banking, is not 
one of 'trust' in the 'banker' but in his net access. What do you 
do when your banker, for whatever reason, becomes unreachable?
