Another crosspollination from PUBLIC_KEYS. Just something to think
about.

It refers to Keith Henson's article I ran in FidoNews (apparently the
file was corrupted, but that's another story.)

This is in no way to imply that the story is bad, nor that I didn't
like it (I did), nor that this is even a common opinion. I actually
received a few thanks for running it. It's just something to consider.
And implies that Keith's article/story is doing it's job!

Speaking of which, the story by Keith Henson in this week's FidoNews
probably set us back ten years.  Now data encryption's indelibly
linked with saboteurs, criminals and terrorists. :-( 

Well, maybe not _everyone_ reads FidoNews... :-)

     Cheers,
        Rich
