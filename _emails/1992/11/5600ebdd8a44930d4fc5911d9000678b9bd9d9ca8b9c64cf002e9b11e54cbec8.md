Vanguard's posting about a friend of his in the Air Force telling him some
things about Air Force crypto devices may be of some theoretical interest,
but posting it here really gets me majorly uncomfortable.   Current military
crypto practices are probably very highly guarded secrets.  Posting that
kind of thing, even in a general way, could be very dangerous; if not to
national security then at least to ours.  

I'd like to ask we have a general agreement to not post things which may be
classified.  No point giving the govt a good excuse to stop our R&D projects
cold.
