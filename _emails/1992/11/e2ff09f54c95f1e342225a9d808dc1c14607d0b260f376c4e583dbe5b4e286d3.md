Good luck.  As a practicing journalist, I can say that there is no way that I  
could make this argument in print.  Everybody understand voter registration.   
There's support for the motor-voter bill.  I can't even explain cryptography in  
the same amount of time that it takes to do an entire article on voter  
registration.

There may be a theoretical connection between the two, but you'll never make  
that argument outside a university.
