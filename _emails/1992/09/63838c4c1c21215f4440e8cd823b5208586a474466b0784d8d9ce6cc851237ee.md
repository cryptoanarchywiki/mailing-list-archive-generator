      Background:

      SEIZING THE MEDIA is the title of pamphlet written by the
      Immediast Underground and first released in Amsterdam ,
      New York City, and Seattle in early 1992. The 26 pamphlet
      combines theory, graphics, research and proposals that examine:

                    * Information control
                    * Propaganda and advertising
                    * CIA
                    * Mind control
                    * Immediast counter-offensives
                    * tactics, subversive networking, public empowerment
                    * multi-media
                    * Public production libraries
                    * the liberation of public space

       ...Just when Jesse Helms thought he made the world safe from
       poetic terrorism, along come the Immediasts, a cadre of media 
       hackers who are fed up with the ecology of coercion that 
       surrounds them. Their booklet SEIZING THE MEDIA proposes an 
       all-out artistic assault on coercive communication, cultural 
       monologue, and media control. They want all media insurgents 
       to take back the airwaves with pirate radio, cable access TV, 
       altering ads and billboards, and otherwise hacking the 
       datasphere to break the spell of State/corporate media control.
	  . . . from Gareth Branwyns STREET NOISE, Issue 7 of Mondo 2000

       SEIZING THE MEDIA Version 1.1 is available for $3 from
       Open Media PO Box 2726  Westfield New Jersey 07091 USA

       THE IMMEDIAST UNDERGROUND is a centerless network of artists,
       writiers, hackers, culture jammers, pirate broadcasters, and
       posterists who connect with one another through information
       systems, mail art, networker congresses, and the underground
       press, and who communicate with the public through actions
       against all forms of coercive communication, space
       infringement, and media control.

       DECENTRALIZED WORLD-WIDE NETWORKER CONGRESSES
       Since the beginning of the year, members of alternative
       info-nets, artists, insurgents, and cultural workers have
       been holding networker congresses, transnational engagements 
       in cultural production, dialogue, collaborations, open 
       exchange, subversive brainstorming, and collective 
       disruptions of dominant culture.

       THE NETWORKER, A NEW PERCEPTION
       In societies where information is money and media is power,
       public access is as controlled as the corporate states grip 
       on communication law, censorship, commerce, covert action 
       and surveillance. In this context, uninhibited public 
       communication, expression, and cultural production are acts 
       of freedom, sovereignty, and defiance. Rooted in the drive to 
       connect and exchange with others, Networker Congress engage 
       in culture and media as the battleground for greater openness 
       and freedom.
