## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}From: nobody@soda.berkeley.edu
Date: Wed, 23 Sep 92 17:28:41 PDT

Pssst.

You don't know where you heard this.  There's a new service available,
and it's free.

If you send mail to 

	hughes@soda.berkeley.edu

with a header line of the form

	Request-Remailing-To: <addressee>

then the software will strip off all the header lines (except the
Subject: line) and remail it to the addressee of your choice.

But there's this rumor that he's saving all the message that pass
through.  Damn.
