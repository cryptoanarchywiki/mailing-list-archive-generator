But as Eric pointed out, and I realized later, the underlying social
structure will allow detection of bum keys (presuming the scammed
person or someone s/he knows notices, etc, and so on, a wholew world
resides here...)

Now I feel very unsecure, because the above is all I got. It ain't no
public key...


PS: Too much anonymity? I have to reply in hte mailing list to this
person cuz it's a faked From... (trust me)
