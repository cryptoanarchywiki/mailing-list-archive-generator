There is no need for sampling of messages.  You don't understand the
theory of power.  Simply make the penalty for encryption without registry,
larger than the penalty for any other crime.  Then no crime can be hidden
behind it.  It's like getting Al Capone for income tax evasion; if you
investigate someone and they are enforcing privacy on their communications,
you can put them in jail for life for that, and can stop worrying about the
original suspected offense.
