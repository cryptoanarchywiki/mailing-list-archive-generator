It should be possible to jam your own emissions, but that same noise
might cause be picked up by your own equipment as well and cause
errors.  Also remember that most of these signals are detected by
correlation, which detects a signal even with a very high S/N ratio.
So it's not obvious just how to jam.  My first guess is to phase-lock
onto your own emmissions and then broadcast random bits at higher
strength.

With E/M monitoring, just like cryptography, you don't really know how
to make defenses unless you know how to attack.
