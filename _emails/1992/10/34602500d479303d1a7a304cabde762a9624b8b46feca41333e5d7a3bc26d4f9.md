I'm pretty new to this mailing list, so something along these lines may
have already been proposed, but I was considering the possibility of
putting together a list of pgp public keys for distribution through this
list.  My own collection of keys is pretty small, and I would pernally 
like to expand this, but I think this would provide a great service to the
group as well.  Let me know what you all think.
