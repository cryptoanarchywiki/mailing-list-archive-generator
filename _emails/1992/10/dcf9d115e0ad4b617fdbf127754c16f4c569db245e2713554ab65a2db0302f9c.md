Seems to me that there would be a certain amount of trouble with people
registering one private key but communicating with another they had 
forgotten to register.  Bad situation for my large sibling 'cause he 
wouldn't realize this until after the court order etc.  A good solution
would be BIG fines for mis-encryption and sampling of messages to make sure
they were properly formed -- for our own protection, of course.  And if
they happened to radomly sample something they didn't like... for instance 
finding my obviously excessive paranoia....
