You aren't the only one Tom.  Apparently lots of Unix mail interfaces
don't let you arbitrarily edit the header or add lines.

I'm going to add a facility to make this possible for everyone.  The
design I have in mind uses only the message body.  No need to touch
the header.

Announcements when it's finished.

Eric
