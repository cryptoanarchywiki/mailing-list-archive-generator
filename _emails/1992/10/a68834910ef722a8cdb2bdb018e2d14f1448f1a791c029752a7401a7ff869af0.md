There has been quite a bit of concern about certain people (agencies)
using a TEMPEST machine and invading privacy.  Most of the things to
defeat this that have been taked about have revolved around shielding. 
What would be the problem with having another device to emit random
signals on the same frequency that your monitor operates on?  Has this
already been implimented?  Legal?
