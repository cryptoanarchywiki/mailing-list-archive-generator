Unfortunately the first two things which come to mind are:

coffee (a drug - actually an excuse for gathering)
papers on public key cryptography (primary information)

radios - illegel in Russia and I believe elsewhere during WWII
East German typewriters - I had one

Also a slight deviation: many medicines (and soon herbal contraptions) 
which are doctor monoply items here, but over the counter in most other
countries.

Religious artifacts of any number of banned religions.

Divorce (opps, not a physical object).

Really on thinking about it, I believe that the trade of ideas is always
far more repressed than the trade in any kind of stuff.
