I look at it this way, by emailing my puplic key anyone can send me a secure 
message (I can't trust where/who it came from but we [the sender and I] can
assume that noone is eavesdroping (it could have been replaced but
not altered or read) 


For secure authenticated, where you *know* if came from me you have to contact
me or someone you trust that has contacted me.
