I keep seeing people propose things like this, and I can't for the
life of me understand why. The only way to know for sure that
someone's key is theirs is a signature from a trusted introducer
anyway, so people can just ask each other in clear for public keys and
it doesn't do a lick of harm -- if they have a trusted signature, you
can use their key for communication and if they don't, you have to
find another way to verify the key.  People making lists of keys and
distributing them seems fairly useless to me. Can anyone tell me if I
am being really really thick here?
