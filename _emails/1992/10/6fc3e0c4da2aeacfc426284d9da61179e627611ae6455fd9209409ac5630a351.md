As of tonight, Thursday 10, the Saturday meeting is in two days.

I'd like to get RSVP's from everyone who plans to attend, so that I
know how many are going to be there.

SEND ONE EVEN IF YOU THINK I KNOW THAT YOU'RE COMING!

I can't keep everyone's attendance plans straight.

Thanks.

Eric
