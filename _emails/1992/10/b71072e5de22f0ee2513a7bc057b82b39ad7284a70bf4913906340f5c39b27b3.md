It's not that simple.  The entropy of a byte is the number of bits needed to
represent it.  If what is uuencoded is extremely repetitive, the entropy
will be low, maybe even less than one.  On the other hand, if it were random
data, it would just be slightly lower than ascii armor.  Binaries are
somewhat repetitive, so they have somewhat less entropy than random data.
English has a lot of redundancy, so it has a low entropy.
