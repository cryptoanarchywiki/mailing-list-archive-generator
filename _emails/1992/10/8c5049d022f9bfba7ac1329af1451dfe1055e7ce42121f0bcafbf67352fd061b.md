"Nobody" writes about the dining cryptographers protocol.

We talked about it at length at our first face-to-face meeting, but
the subject has barely come up on this list. People should read the
Chaum articles in the handout, and the excellent tutorial by Jurgen
Bos, also in the handout. It is truly exciting stuff, much more so
than the usual "classical cryptography" that we mostly talk about here
on this list.

Part of my great concern about the public key registration proposal is
that it will, if enforced, kill off many of these approaches that rely
on dynamically changing keys and digital pseudonyms.

If there's interest out there in the DC Net approach that "Nobody" so
nicely summarized, I'll forward some articles I wrote a while back for
another list.
