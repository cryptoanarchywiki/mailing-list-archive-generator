re: Interface for re-mailer; why not hitch it to emacs or something?
 
re: problem with key distribution; right, OK, I hadn't thought that
there might be a security problem with casually giving someone your
key
without them being able to authenticate that it came from you.  Good
point.

Here's my public key.  If you feel it is not secure enough, we can
always use the cone of silence:
 
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.0


23l1t34u
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
