Interesting ideas so far... Hey, anyone see the Quantum Crypto article in
October Scientific AMerican?  Of course the approach isn't practical at this
point, and doing it over fiber optics won't be any better since the
amplification along the way would raise the quantum process to the classical
level and destroy its value... but even so, interesting as theory...
