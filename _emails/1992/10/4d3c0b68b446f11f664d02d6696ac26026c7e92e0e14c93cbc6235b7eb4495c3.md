When banks start signing with private keys, then we get an even more
interesting monitoring problem.

Sometimes it is cheaper to build a whole building to be tempest-spec
than to buy all tempest-spec electronics.  What I have heard about
such stuff is solid copper walls and no windows.  No exacly your
classical Faraday cage; more like your classical Gaussian surface. :->

TEMPEST is an acronym.  I don't remember for what.
