Tim's summary of Denning raises some interesting points, and no doubt this
will end up in the courts in due time.  Some angles of attack which might be
pursued include 2nd amendment (original grounds: protection against tyrrany)
and 1st amendment.  Re the latter, a lawyer I spoke with some years ago,
proposed the idea that freedom of speech in some cases depends on the
ability for the speaker to determine who will and who will not receive what
is said.  

Then of course there is always good oldfashioned civil disobedience.  If
enough people conscientiously violate the regulation, it will become
unenforceable and all the more likely to be overturned.
