Any attempt at "secret law" in the US would be pretty straightforward to
defeat on the basis that it denies due process and a whole lot else besides.
 Secret court orders!  Retch!  Next person to get one should run not walk to
the offices of the nearest big newspaper or radio/TV station and do a live
on-air interview.  Then the govt has to take on the press as well, and by
that time it's kinda too late.
