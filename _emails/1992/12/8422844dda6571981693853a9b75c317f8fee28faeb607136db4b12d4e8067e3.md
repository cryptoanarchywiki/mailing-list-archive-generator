Yipes.  I got a whole bunch of (advance) requests for tapes of the
interview, so I'm posting this to the group to make things a bit
easier for myself...

I'll be more than happy to send copies to anyone for the cost
of postage and the blank tape.  I'll also be sending a copy to
Tim, so if it's easier, you can try to get him to dupe it for you.
Of course, being a worrywart, I'll hold off until Monday to confirm
that the thing went off without a hitch.  I'll post to the group
then and let you know.

   --Dave.
