I don't know what is in the file entirely, but it looked like the one I have
read on the legality of using tempest shields and such.  I have other files on the issue as well, I would like you guys to tell me whats you think, and if I 
should post the others as well.

treason@gnu   - You have free will, but you will go to hell if you use it!
