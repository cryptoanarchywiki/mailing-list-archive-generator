Does anybody have any contact information for David Chaum or DigiCash?
I think it's worthwhile to find out if any of the problems we've been
discussing have been previously solved.  It's possible that our
experiment could increase visibility of digital cash to the point that
a real commercial venture could work, in which case he may even be
interested in helping us.

Email me personally, I'll summarize.

		Marc
