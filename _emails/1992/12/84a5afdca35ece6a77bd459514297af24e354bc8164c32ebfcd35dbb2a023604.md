It would seem to me that someone somewhere should produce a "random
number server" available via a well-known internet port number. Some
natural phenomenon not readily available to all could be used to generate
such numbers and one could just connect and ask for a number. It would be
interesting to try to devise means by which interception or sequencing
could be prevented.
