A note for fools like me trying to get Mac .hqx files through "ftpmail"...

USE ASCII MODE!  Otherwise it defaults to adding an extra layer of "btoa"
encoding on the file (or you can switch it to uuencode, but why uuencode
an .hqx file--it's already plain text).  "btoa" files start like this:
        xbtoa begin
        wef9a87eg8a9wery8s7arg87gae8g7waeo87rwe8r(garbage)...
as opposed to uuencoded files like:
        begin fred.txt
        aewhgp9ergu90ser890syuer98gse98r(garbage)...
or .hqx files (this is from memory):
        (This file has to be decoded with BinHex 2.0)
        k9wegesz9p8rgy89serg9oser98ser98(garbage)...

I don't know where to find "btoa," and ftpmail's help message just says
to ask my local wizard.  He never heard of it.

--- Example request to ftpmail ---
        connect mac.archive.umich.edu
        cd mac/util/encryption
        ascii
        get macpgp2.0.sit.hqx
