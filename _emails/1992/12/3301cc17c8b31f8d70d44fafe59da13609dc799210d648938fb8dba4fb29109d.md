Since it is possible to archive, I think we should all operate under the
assumption that archiving is being done.  And if we are operating under that
assumption, there is nothing wrong with archiving.  This is why multiple,
encrypted, and possibly overseases boucnes are so important.  The security
of remailing doesn't depend on trusting the operators.  It relies on there
being at least one operator who won't reveal show his logs.  If one of your
bounces happens to be through your own remailer, you can gaurantee this.
