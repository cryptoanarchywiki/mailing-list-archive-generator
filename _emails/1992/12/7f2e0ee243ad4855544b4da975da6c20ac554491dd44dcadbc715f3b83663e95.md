{% raw  %}From: nobody@cs.Buffalo.EDU
Date: Fri, 4 Dec 92 17:32:06 PST
To: cypherpunks@toad.com
Subject: Another remailer
Message-ID: <9212042350.AA10597@armstrong.cs.Buffalo.EDU>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


I have set up another reamiler... the address is babani@cs.buffalo.edu
Be warned: There is no PGP ability as of yet.

Let me emphisize that:  THERE IS NO PGP ABILITY ON THIS REMAILER. 

I have not gotten the pgp program up and running as of yet.  But... if
you want to bounce mail through the remailer... it shouldn't be to
much of a problem.  Just use one of the other remailer keys and
encrypt your message with that.  Just add the usual lines to your
message.  For example:

----Begin fake message to a remailer----
::
Request-Remailing-To: remailer@rebma.mn.org

--------BEGIN PGPv2.0 MESSAGE------ (endcoded with rebma's key)
blah blah
--------END PGPv2.0 MESSAGE-------

----End fake message to a remailer------


Report any problems to me or to any of the other remailing sites.
