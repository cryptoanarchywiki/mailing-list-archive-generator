For best security with a mix-net remailer, it should immediately
forget where a message came from.  

So if you want anonymous reply capability, the remailer could create
that unique id, but instead of associating it with a return address,
associate it with a public key (transmitted along with the message).

Then when someone sends a reply, the remailer would encrypt it with
the public key, and broadcast it.  You monitor the broacasts for
ones with public keys that match private keys you have.
