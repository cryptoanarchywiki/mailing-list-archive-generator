	Well, it looks like it is going to happen. I, too, am interested
in seeing the experiment run. The way it was talked about earlier this
week, I pictured a system where people would snail-mail an amount of money
to a central authority (bank) and would be turned into credits. Since this
was only a simulation (not to raise eyebrows) I was thinking that a cap
could be established (say, $25). Now it looks as if we'll have no acutal
cash backing for the first simulation. How will this be distributed?
Should everyone on the list be given a set amount of digital cash to start
the 'poker game', or will we choose a smaller, representative sample? 
	For the game, we'll have to set up an account as an internet
`bank', scripts to handle incoming cash requests, etc. Are these the least
of our worries? 

	I'm also willing to help in any way I can, although I too know
little C. I have a decent background in various other areas which may be
helpful. 

	On an entirely different subject: Has anyone worked up a PGP
version that may help me out? My 286 plugs along when working on keys. :)
I am specifically wondering if anyone has hacked in and created a PGP that
supports the '87 coprocessor.

thanks-
