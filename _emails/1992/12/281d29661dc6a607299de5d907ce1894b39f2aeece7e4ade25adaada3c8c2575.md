I am not aware of any single RFC that defines this, but every RFC
that I have read, if it mentions end-of-line at all, it is defined
as, or assumed to be, a carriage return followed by a newline.

Even in cases where the native representation is different, it
is converted to this format before transmission through the net,
and then converted back.  This is in some RFC-s referred to 
as "internet tradition", or "NetAscii".

This is similar to the Network Byte Order.  No matter what order
your machine stores bytes (little/big endian), it gets converted
to one standard format.

It is also referred to as "NVT Standard".

The only mention of a different end of line convention is in
relation to EBCDIC, which has an explicit newline <NL> character.

Here are excerpts from various RFCs that deal with, or mention, 
use of CRLF at the end of lines:

       Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support

              To allow interoperability between arbitrary Telnet clients
              and servers, the Telnet protocol defined a standard
              representation for a line terminator.  Since the ASCII
              character set includes no explicit end-of-line character,
              systems have chosen various representations, e.g., CR, LF,
              and the sequence CR LF.  The Telnet protocol chose the CR
              LF sequence as the standard for network transmission.
