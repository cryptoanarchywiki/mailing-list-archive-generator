Why not generate a key just for this conversation, and then post a full
128-bit (22 base64 characters) hash in the subject.

You can even have a key for each message if the conconversation is two-way
then whenever you are about to send a message you can generate a new key
pair and include the new public key with your message.  

As soon as you receive and decrypt the message for that key, destroy the
private key.
