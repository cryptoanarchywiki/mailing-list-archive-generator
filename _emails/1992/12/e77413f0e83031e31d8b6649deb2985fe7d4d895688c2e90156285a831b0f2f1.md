I keep logs on content and origin on my three remailers.  I do read the
logs.  However, I would not censor any transmissions.  I would stop
accepting mail from a site given enough reasonable complaints.

Dido for me.  I would make an attempt to destroy all of my data if an
attempt were made to take the equipment or access the data by a government
or other agency.
