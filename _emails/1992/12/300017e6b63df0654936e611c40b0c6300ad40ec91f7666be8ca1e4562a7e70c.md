Am I correct in understanding that what's actually detected and
reconstructed by TEMPEST surveillance is the EMR having to do with
screen drawing, and not the CPU and other internal components involved
in processing data?

If that's the case, would computers without CRT-type displays still be
succeptible to TEMPEST surveillance? Such as headless servers that
might be running a BBS without a video card inside or a monitor. Or
laptops, such as a Mac PowerBook with an active-matrix screen?

Thanks,
Doug
