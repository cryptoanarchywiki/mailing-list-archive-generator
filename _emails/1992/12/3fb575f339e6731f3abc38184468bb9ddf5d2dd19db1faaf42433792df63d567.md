This seems to be the correct solution to me.  If PGP did this
automatically in text signature mode, then it would be up to the
reciever to decide if spaces were significant or not, and they would
be prompted to think about this when the verbatim signature
verification failed.  If one often recieved messages with mangled
spacing, one could become desensitized to this, but there's not much
to be done about that.
