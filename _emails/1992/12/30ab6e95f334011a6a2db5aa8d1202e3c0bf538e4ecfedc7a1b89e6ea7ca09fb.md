This is quite wrong. This only makes sense if RSA were inherently much
faster than IDEA. In fact, IDEA is orders of magnitude slower than
RSA; thats the whole reason that we use IDEA session keys encrypted
with RSA and not RSA itself to encrypt the message -- RSA is way too
slow. The result of this is that trying all possible IDEA keys
directly to break the cypher is far far faster than trying to encrypt
all possible IDEA keys with RSA. Now, since the security of IDEA
depends on it being secure from brute force attacks like trying all
possible IDEA keys and seeing which one produces a good message, the
result is that if IDEA is secure, PGP is certainly secure from the
attack you mention.

If the random number generator is good, then it should not be possible
to predict the next session key. If it is bad, all bets are off. I
would agree that questions of the quality of the RNG have been
inadequitely explored.
