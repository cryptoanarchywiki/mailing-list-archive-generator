There is an easier way.  Just generate a public/private key pair.  Store
the public key on the machine, and have the remailer encrypt its logs
with the public key.  Someone seizing the machine could not find anything,
since they do not have the private key.

Store the private key on another machine, or on a floppy.  When there's
a problem, you can transfer the encrypted log to the machine with the
private key, and then you can decrypt the log to see what went wrong.

Generate a new key pair weekly, and destroy the old private key.  You
should never need logs older than a week for troubleshooting.

So how about a few lines of perl?
