I picked this up off the net a while ago.  Sounds like the CL451 might
be programmable to do encryption/decryption, too.

Background:  MPEG is a compression standard for compressing VHS-quality
video and stereo audio into a 1.5Mbit/s stream.

If anyone's interested in funding/collaborating on a project involving
this, let's talk.
