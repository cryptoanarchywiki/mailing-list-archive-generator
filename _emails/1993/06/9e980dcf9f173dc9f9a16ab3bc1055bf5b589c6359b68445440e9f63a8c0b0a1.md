DES defines an encryption algorithm, but not how it is deployed
in an environment. 

Questions I would have:

    --  Is the key that the user types in used DIRECTLY as a
	8-ASCII-character DES key?  If you don't type 8 characters
	for the key, how is it padded?

    --	Does it use CBC mode, or what?

    --	Where does it get an initialization vector?

    --  Assuming CBC or some other chaining mode, is an entire file
	encrypted as a single unit?  Or is each file block encrypted,
	beginning with a quickly-determined initialization vector, 
	and what are they?

    --  If the length of the file is not a multiple of 8 bytes (the 
	DES cyperblock size), how is the boundary condition handled?

    --  Are filenames encrypted?  How?  Other directory information?  

If the source to Norton were not published, but rigorous specs were
available that could be verified by trying it an a bunch of files,
and if one can account for all bytes on disk that change when the
package is used (so that we know it is not escrowing keys or doing
anthing stupid with them), then I might feel comfortable about
the product.

I don't think this is unreasonable to ask.  It would particularly
make me feel safe about the problems we heard described earlier, where
someone was unable to decrypt files.   If I can deploy and use my own
decryption mechanism to doublecheck Norton, then it's more likely
my own fault if I cannot recover some file.
