Am suprised no-one's mentioned DISKREET, the encrypted disk driver software 
included with the Norton Utilities. It does DES, though the manual doesn't 
mention which flavor of DES it uses. I have been using it for roughly 2 
years now without any trouble. It's been well-behaved and is probably 
already on lots of folks' disks, by virtue of being included with the rest 
of the Norton stuff.

I think "TPU" refers to Turbo Pascal Units. "Async Pro" is, if I remember 
right, the name of an add-on async communications library for Turbo Pascal. 
Telix is not free, but is freely distributable, as it's shareware.
