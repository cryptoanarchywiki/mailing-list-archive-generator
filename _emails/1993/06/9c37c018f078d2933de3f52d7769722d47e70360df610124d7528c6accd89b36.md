	Yeah. OTP's seem awfully cumbersome.

	Hmm? I don't understand this problem. There's only one set of
cyphertext.. the actual cyphertext. Do you mean "different batch of
cyphertext" as the OTP which creates the innocuous plaintext from the
cyphertext? Maybe encrypt the OTP w/DES and keep it on your hard drive.
When "they" snag the drive, they see the different cyphertext, you tell
them that it's the OTP you used and give them the DES-key to decrypt the
innocuous OTP.
	I sense a problem with histogram equalization, however. Is there a
problem here or does OTP-encryption take care of that?
