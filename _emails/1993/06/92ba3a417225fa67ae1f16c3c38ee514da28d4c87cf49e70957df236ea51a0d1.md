This keeps popping up, probably due to old _Dragnet_ episodes...

As I understand contract law regarding leases, a landlord _cannot_
grant permission for a police search unless the lease is in default.
Or, more precisely, if they did you could sue them for "breach of
contract" and extract pretty hefty penalties.

Perhaps California leases have some standard clause which permits
this, but in general a "lease" transfers all "non-freeholder" property
rights, except for those explicitly -returned- within the contract.
That means the tenant is the property owner for all intents and
purposes except for "freeholder" rights (e.g., a tenant can't sell
the property).
