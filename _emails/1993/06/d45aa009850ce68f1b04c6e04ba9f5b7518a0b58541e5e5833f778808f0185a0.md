Situation: I'd like mail that arrives at my other account to be
encrypted and then forwarded to this account.  I have spent a few
hours trying various things and nothing seems to work.

I've tried this as my .forward file:

"| /myhome/pgp -fea barrus | mail elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu"

but all that arrives at elee9sf is a blank message.

I've tried

"| /myhome/remail.script"

where remail.script was a one-liner similar to the above.  Nothing.

Any suggestions?  Note:
1) barrus@tree.egr.uh.edu is a NeXT account.  Is NeXTSTEP just too
different for this stuff to work?
2) I'm running pgp2.1 on tree.egr, and don't have the old docs
anymore.  Was the -f option not present?
3) Anybody have a makefile for NeXT so I can upgrade?  I compiled 2.1
by hand editing some lines, but the task looks pretty daunting with
2.2.  I tried 'make mach' but that didn't get very far.


So, if that's impossible, how do I get my elee9sf account to do it?  I
use mh on menudo, and have tried

to barrus@tree.egr.uh.edu | A "/path/pgp -fea barrus | /path/rvcstore +tonext"

in my .maildelivery but that doesn't seem to fly either.  

Any suggestions?
