If we are talking about an off-line reader, this is solved by a trivial filter
routine.  If you want to do this on-line, well it might take time.

Why save the plaintext?  I keep it in cyphertext and decrypt it on demand.  And
when I want to reply, then I decrypt it, quote it and have the user edit that 
file, which will presumably be re-encrypted.

Actually, these are the same problems in different clothes.

These last 2 paragraphs describe almost exactly what my scripts do!

I find that I need to be a bit more modular with my scripts so that I can call
a different module depending on which type of system I'm on...Working on it at
this moment.
