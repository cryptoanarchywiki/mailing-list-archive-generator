There is only one directory on the cypherpunks site that is writable,
and that is the incoming directory and it's not readable.

I still don't know what the real accusation is.  CERT is straight out
of a Kafka novel in this regard.  Maybe it's PGP, maybe it isn't, but
they don't seem to be offering that information.
