>This is tiring drivel concerning the CryptoStacker project.  

If you want help, it is wise not to recklessly insult those who are
offering it.  By your own admission, you do not have a lot of
experience here; you seem to be saying "I know exactly what I don't
know," which, may I add, is a common delusion of the inexperienced.

You seem to have fixed a model of how the encrypted disk would work
and don't want to debate it.  The model is exactly that which requires
the most scrutiny, because it has the most far reaching effects.  If
the model is flawed somehow, that's what you want to know before you
begin, not six months later.

I take it that you want people to use this software after it is
written.  if so, then pay close attention to user acceptance issues
such as performance and key handling.  You neglect them at your own
risk.

Your model seems to be that of intercepting interrupts to the disk.
This could be made to work, but is the wrong way to do it.  If you
insist on that, though, any good PC reference book will tell you what
the disk interrupt vector in the BIOS is.  Ralf Brown's interrupt list
also contains the relevant data in schematic form.

The proper way to do this is as a device driver, however.  Grabbing
interrupts is messy and prone to interference.  Many anti-virus
programs monitor the disk interrupt to make sure that nobody uses it
unauthorized.  A device driver is the intended way to create new
devices, like an encrypted disk.  There are complete books about
writing device drivers; you will need one of these or some other good
DOS programming book which explains how to write one.  There are
lots of subtleties about them.

I would suggest that you first version just be a device driver that
has no encryption, but only the hook for it.  The device driver
skeleton for a disk will be difficult enough, as you have to support a
whole lot of operations just so you can have a place to put the
encryption.  This is exactly the software infrastructure problem in
another context.

After you have a device driver skeleton working, you can add both
hardware and software encryption modules.  There is no need to be
exclusive about this.  It is clear to me from your comments that you
haven't timed any DES routines and done a calculation of increased
latency times, and although I hate to see code development go to
waste, it's your time, not mine.

As far as picking an encryption algorithm, use DES.  DES is the
fastest symmetric keyed block cipher that is thought to be reasonably
secure.  DES is not particularly fast in software; it was designed as
a hardware standard and does lots of bit manipulations.  DES is fast
enough for serial communications, but that 1000 times less the
bandwidth than a hard disk.

Of course, you don't want to run DES in codebook (aka naive) mode.
(Codebook mode is where you just simply map block to block; the
problem is that identical blocks map to identical blocks.)  You'll
want some sort of other mode, like a counter mode, to make sure you
don't get identical ciphertexts.  It is also a bad idea to encrypt the
whole disk with one key; it makes brute force searches much easier.

Your keying material should be long.  I earlier suggested one key per
track.  These keys are going to have to be stored somewhere, and the
disk is the wrong place for it, clearly.  This implies that the user
is going to have to have some key-holding device (likely a diskette)
which will be necessary in order to unlock the partition.  the keying
material should be password protected.  This device will be have to
used at boot time if anything necessary to boot is stored on the
encrypted partition.

Keying material will need to be backed up.  This should be made as
painless as possible, otherwise there will be plenty of people losing
whole drives.

Keys in the driver should time out after some specifiable period.
Files that are open when the time-out occurs and the programs that
have them open are going to have to be dealt with gracefully.

This model of using a device driver means that there is going to have
to be at least two partitions on the disk: one to boot from, and one
to be encrypted.  The device driver itself and the operating system
can't be on the encrypted disk, because those components must be
loaded before the encrypted disk is accessible.  Most people are not
going to go out and buy a new disk to be the encrypted partition.
Thus, this is going to mean a full backup of the existing disk, an
operation with FDISK to do the partitioning, then, assuming the driver
works right the first time, restoring everything else on the encrypted
partition.  What is the effect of _this_ on user acceptance?

Eric
