Speed.  No software implementation will be able to match a hardware DES
chip in total throughput.  I have enough trouble dealing with the drive
transfer speeds imposed upon PC unix systems with the lame bus, but even
this could keep up if I had to run my file access through a software DES
system.  There are cards out there that can do this, and it doesn't really
make sense not to offload this to an external device.

Yes, the other thing that pushed me to linux (besides the larger user
community) was the support for "drop-in" filesystems.
