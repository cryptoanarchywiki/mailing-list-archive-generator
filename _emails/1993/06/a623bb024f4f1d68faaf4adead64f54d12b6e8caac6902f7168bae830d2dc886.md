	 There is only one directory on the cypherpunks site that is writable,
	 and that is the incoming directory and it's not readable.

It doesn't have to be.  Anyone could create ``incoming/.. '', stick
some files in it, and tell his/her friends.  The new directory would
be readable.

Again, I'm not speaking hypothetically here.  In our case, it was ..^T,
and contained pirated PC software.  (We decided not to infect those files
with viruses...  We didn't even replace them with programs that just
printed nasty messages.)
