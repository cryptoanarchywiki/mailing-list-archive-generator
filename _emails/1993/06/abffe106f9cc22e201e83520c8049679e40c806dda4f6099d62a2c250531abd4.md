 Uu> I tried pinging all the remailers on the latest copy I have of
 Uu> Karl's remailer list (except extropia, which I know only accepts
 Uu> encrypted messages).  I sent to each:

 Uu> ::
 Uu> Request-Remailing-To: hfinney@shell.portal.com

 Uu> then a short test message.

 Uu> I only heard back from 8 of them, to wit:

 Uu> hfinney@shell.portal.com  Sun Jun 27 08:48:08 1993
 Uu> hh@soda.berkeley.edu  Sun Jun 27 08:48:15 1993
 Uu> remail@tamsun.tamu.edu  Sun Jun 27 08:48:38 1993
 Uu> nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu  Sun Jun 27 08:48:43 1993
 Uu> phantom@u.washington.edu  Sun Jun 27 08:48:40 1993
 Uu> elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu  Sun Jun 27 08:48:56 1993
 Uu> hal@alumni.cco.caltech.edu  Sun Jun 27 08:48:59 1993
 Uu> dis.org!remailer@merde.dis.org  Sun Jun 27 09:17:24 1993

I have had problems with getting the same test routed through hh@soda
and phantom@u.washington.  I have not tried dis.org! yet.

Uu> I did not hear back from the following remailers.  Perhaps their
Uu> operators could check on them, or notify Karl if they are no longer
Uu> operating.
Uu> 1: hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu
Uu> 2: hh@cicada.berkeley.edu
Uu> 6: remail@tamaix.tamu.edu
Uu> 7: ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu
Uu> 9: remailer@rebma.mn.org
Uu>14: 00x@uclink.berkeley.edu

#6 has worked for me.  The others have not, though the hh@_berkeley
remailers will sometimes work if the message is first bounced through
another reliable remailer.  Why this should be, I know not.

Sending the PGP-encrypted message & header to remail@extropia.wimsey.com
seems to work very well for losing those stupid footer IDs, & is usually
my first leg of multiple-bounce test transmissions.

BTW, I note that hal@alumni.caltech.edu has a different address in the
first batch of successful remailers.  The address hal@alumni.caltech.edu
has worked well.

Thanks for your efforts!
