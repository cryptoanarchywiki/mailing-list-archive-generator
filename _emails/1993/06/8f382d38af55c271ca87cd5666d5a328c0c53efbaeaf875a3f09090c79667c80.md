 > 
 > What follows is a copy of my written testimony before the House
 > Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance. The June 9th hearing
 > was supposed to have been on the topic of network security, toll
 > fraud, and the social implications of the rapidly emerging
 > technologies. I was asked to speak for those who had no voice, which
 > translates to hackers and consumers. Instead I found myself barraged
 > with accusations from the two representatives in attendance (Rep. Ed
 > Markey D-MA and Rep. Jack Fields R-TX) who considered 2600 Magazine
 > (of which I'm the editor) nothing more than a manual for computer
 > crime. One article in particular that Markey latched upon was one in
 > our Spring issue that explained how a cable descrambler worked.
 > According to Markey, there was no use for this information outside of
 > a criminal context. Fields claimed we were printing cellular "codes"
 > that allowed people to listen in on cellular calls. In actuality, we
 > printed frequencies. The difference didn't seem to matter - after
 > explaining it to him, he still said he was very disturbed by the fact
 > that I was allowed to keep publishing. It soon became apparent to me
 > that neither one had read my testimony as there seemed to be no
 > inclination to discuss any of the issues I had brought up. In a way,
 > it was very much like being on the Geraldo show. Somehow I thought
 > elected representatives would be less sensationalist and more
 > interested in learning but this was not the case here. We got
 > absolutely nowhere. Markey in particular was rude, patronizing, and
 > not at all interested in entertaining any thought outside his narrow
 > perception. It's too bad this opportunity was lost. There is a real
 > danger in elected officials who don't listen to all relevant opinions
 > and who persist in sticking to old-fashioned, outdated notions that
 > just don't apply to high technology. You can look forward to more

 > HOW NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN HURT US
 > 
 >      The recent FBI proposal to have wiretap capabilities built into
 > digital telephone systems got most of its publicity because American
 > taxpayers were expected to foot the bill. But to many of the
 > non-technical people I talked to, it was just another example of Big
 > Brother edging one step closer. It is commonly believed that the
 > National Security Agency monitors all traffic on the Internet, not to
 > mention all international telephone calls.  Between Caller ID, TRW
 > credit reports, video cameras, room monitors, and computer
 > categorizations of our personalities, the average American feels as if
 > life no longer has many private moments. Our Social Security numbers,
 > which once were for Social Security, are now used for everything from
 > video rentals to driver's licenses. These numbers can easily be used
 > to track a person's location, expenses, and habits - all without any
 > consent. If you know a person's name, you can get their telephone
 > number. If you have their phone number, you can get their address.
 > Getting their Social Security number is not even a challenge anymore.
 > With this information, you can not only get every bit of information
 > about this person that exists on any computer from Blockbuster Video
 > to the local library to the phone company to the FBI, but you can
 > begin to do things in this poor person's name. It's possible we may
 > want a society like this, where we will be accountable for our every
 > movement and where only criminals will pursue privacy. The American
 > public needs to be asked. But first, they need to understand.
 > 
 >      In Germany, there is a fairly new computerized system of identity
 > cards. Every citizen must carry one of these cards. The information
 > includes their name, address, date of birth, and nationality - in
 > other words, the country they were originally born in. Such a system
 > of national identity can be quite useful, but in the wrong hands it
 > can be extremely scary. For example, if a neo-Nazi group were to
 > somehow get their hands on the database, they could instantly find out
 > where everyone of Turkish nationality lived. A malevolent government
 > could do the same and, since not carrying the card would be a crime,
 > it would be very hard to avoid its wrath.
 > 
 >      Before introducing a new technology that is all-encompassing, all
 > of its potential side-effects and disadvantages should be discussed
 > and addressed. Opportunities must exist for everyone to ask questions.
 > In our own country, nobody was ever asked if they wanted a credit file
 > opened on them, if they wanted to have their phone numbers given to
 > the people and companies they called through the use of Caller ID and
 > ANI, or if they wanted to be categorized in any manner on numerous
 > lists and databases. Yet all of this has now become standard practice.
 > 
 >      This implementation of new rules has resulted in a degree of
 > cynicism in many of us, as well as a sense of foreboding and dread. We
 > all know that these new inventions will be abused and used to
 > somebody's advantage at some point. There are those who would have us

 > UNDERSTANDING COMPUTER HACKERS
 > 
 >      To understand computer hackers, it helps to think of an alien
 > culture. We have such cultures constantly around us - those with
 > teenage children ought to know what this means. There are alien
 > cultures of unlimited varieties throughout the globe, sometimes in the
 > most unexpected places. I'm convinced that this is a good thing.
 > Unfortunately, all too often our default setting on whatever it is we
 > don't understand is "bad". Suspicion and hostility follow and are soon
 > met with similar feelings from the other side. This has been going on
 > between and within our cultures for as long as we've existed. While we
 > can't stop it entirely, we can learn to recognize the danger signs.
 > The best way that I've found to deal with an alien culture, whether
 > it's in a foreign country or right here at home, is to try and
 > appreciate it while giving it a little leeway. There is not a single
 > alien culture I've encountered that has not been decidedly friendly.
 > That includes deadheads, skateboarders, Rastafarians, and hackers.
 > 
 >      When we talk about computer hackers, different images spring to
 > mind. Most of these images have come about because of perceptions
 > voiced by the media. Too often, as I'm sure the members of this
 > committee already suspect, the media just doesn't get it. This is not
 > necessarily due to malice on their part but rather a general lack of
 > understanding and an overwhelming pressure to produce a good story.
 > Hence we get an abundance of sensationalism and, when the dust clears,
 > hackers are being compared with bank robbers, mobsters, terrorists,
 > and the like.  It's gotten to the point that the word hacker is almost
 > analogous to the word criminal.
 > 
 >      Fortunately, the media is learning. Reporters now approach
 > hackers with a degree of technological savvy. For the most part, they
 > have stopped asking us to commit crimes so they can write a story
 > about it. As the technology envelops us, journalists are developing
 > the same appreciation and curiosity for it that hackers have always
 > had. Any good reporter is at least part hacker because what a hacker
 > does primarily is relentlessly pursue an answer. Computers naturally
 > lend themselves to this sort of pursuit, since they tend to be very
 > patient when asked a lot of questions.
 > 
 > WHAT CONSTITUTES A HI-TECH CRIME?
 > 
 >      So where is the boundary between the hacker world and the
 > criminal world? To me, it has always been in the same place. We know
 > that it's wrong to steal tangible objects. We know that it's wrong to
 > vandalize. We know that it's wrong to invade somebody's privacy. Not
 > one of these elements is part of the hacker world.
 > 
 >      A hacker can certainly turn into a criminal and take advantage of
 > the weaknesses in our telephone and computer systems. But this is
 > rare. What is more likely is that a hacker will share knowledge with
 > people, one of whom will decide to use that knowledge for criminal
 > purposes. This does not make the hacker a criminal for figuring it
 > out. And it certainly doesn't make the criminal into a hacker.
 > 
 >      It is easy to see this when we are talking about crimes that we
 > understand as crimes. But then there are the more nebulous crimes; the
 > ones where we have to ask ourselves: "Is this really a crime?" Copying
 > software is one example. We all know that copying a computer program
 > and then selling it is a crime. It's stealing, plain and simple. But
 > copying a program from a friend to try it out on your home computer --
 > is this the same kind of crime? It seems obvious to me that it is not,
 > the reason being that you must make a leap of logic to turn such an
 > action into a crime. Imagine if we were to charge a licensing fee
 > every time somebody browsed through a magazine at the local bookshop,
 > every time material was borrowed from a library, or every time a phone
 > number was jotted down from the yellow pages. Yet, organizations like
 > the Software Publishers Association have gone on record as saying that
 > it is illegal to use the same computer program on more than one
 > computer in your house. They claim that you must purchase it again or
 > face the threat of federal marshalls kicking in your door. That is a
 > leap of logic.
 > 
 >      It is a leap of logic to assume that because a word processor

 > I believe technological literacy is becoming increasingly important.
 > But you cannot have literacy of any kind without having access.
 > 
 >      If we continue to make access to technology difficult,
 > bureaucratic, and illogical, then there will also be more computer

 > LEGISLATION FOR COMPUTER AGE CRIME
 > 
 >      New laws are not needed because there is not a single crime that
 > can be committed with a computer that is not already defined as a
 > crime without a computer. But let us not be loose with that
 > definition. Is mere unauthorized access to a computer worthy of
 > federal indictments, lengthy court battles, confiscation of equipment,
 > huge fines, and years of prison time? Or is it closer to a case of
 > trespassing, which in the real world is usually punished by a simple
 > warning? "Of course not," some will say, "since accessing a computer
 > is far more sensitive than walking into an unlocked office building."
 > If that is the case, why is it still so easy to do? If it's possible
 > for somebody to easily gain unauthorized access to a computer that has
 > information about me, I would like to know about it. But somehow I
 > don't think the company or agency running the system would tell me
 > that they have gaping security holes. Hackers, on the other hand, are
 > very open about what they discover which is why large corporations
 > hate them so much. Through legislation, we can turn what the hackers
 > do into a crime and there just might be a slim chance that we can stop
 > them. But that won't fix poorly designed systems whose very existence
 > is a violation of our privacy.
 > 
 > THE DANGERS OF UNINFORMED CONSUMERS
 > 
 >      The concept of privacy is something that is very important to a
 > hacker. This is so because hackers know how fragile privacy is in
 > today's world. Wherever possible we encourage people to protect their
 > directories, encrypt their electronic mail, not use cellular phones,
 > and whatever else it takes to keep their lives to themselves. In 1984
 > hackers were instrumental in showing the world how TRW kept credit
 > files on millions of Americans. Most people had never even heard of a
 > credit file until this happened.  Passwords were very poorly guarded -
 > in fact, credit reports had the password printed on the credit report
 > itself. More recently, hackers found that MCI's Friends and Family
 > program allowed anybody to call an 800 number and find out the numbers
 > of everyone in a customer's "calling circle". As a bonus, you could
 > also find out how these numbers were related to the customer:  friend,
 > brother, daughter-in-law, business partner, etc. Many times these
 > numbers were unlisted yet all that was needed to "verify" the
 > customer's identity was the correct zip code. In both the TRW and MCI
 > cases, hackers were ironically accused of being the ones to invade
 > privacy. What they really did was help to educate the American
 > consumer.
 > 
 >      Nowhere is this more apparent than in the telephone industry.
 > Throughout the country, telephone companies take advantage of
 > consumers. They do this primarily because the consumer does not
 > understand the technology. When we don't understand something
 > complicated, we tend to believe those who do understand. The same is
 > true for auto mechanics, plumbers, doctors, and lawyers. They all
 > speak some strange language that the majority of us will never
 > understand. So we tend to believe them. The difference with the phone
 > companies, and here I am referring to the local companies, is that you
 > cannot deal with somebody else if you happen to disagree with them or
 > find them untrustworthy. The phone companies have us in a situation
 > where we must believe what they say. If we don't believe them, we
 > cannot go elsewhere.
 > 
 >      This is the frustration that the hacker community constantly
 > faces. We face it especially because we are able to understand when
 > the local phone companies take advantage of consumers. Here are a few
 > examples:
 > 
 >      Charging a fee for touch tone service. This is a misnomer.  It
 > actually takes extra effort to tell the computer to ignore the tones
 > that you produce. Everybody already has touch tone capability but we
 > are forced to pay the phone company not to block it. While $1.50 a
 > month may not seem like much, when added together the local companies
 > that still engage in this practice are making millions of dollars a
 > year for absolutely nothing. Why do they get away with it? Because too
 > many of us don't understand how the phone system works. I try to draw
 > an analogy in this particular case - imagine if the phone company
 > decided that a fee would be charged to those customers who wanted to
 > use the number five when dialing. They could argue that the five takes
 > more energy than the four but most of us would see through this flimsy
 > logic. We must seek out other such dubious practices and not blindly
 > accept what we are told.
 > 
 >      Other examples abound: being charged extra not to have your name
 > listed in the telephone directory, a monthly maintenance charge if you
 > select your own telephone number, the fact that calling information to
 > get a number now costs more than calling the number itself.
 > 
 >      More recently, we have become acquainted with a new standard
 > called Signalling System Seven or SS7. Through this system it is
 > possible for telephones to have all kinds of new features: Caller ID,
 > Return Call, Repeat Calling to get through a busy signal, and more.
 > But again, we are having the wool pulled over our eyes. For instance,
 > if you take advantage of Call Return in New York (which will call the
 > last person who dialed your number), you are charged 75 cents on top
 > of the cost of the call itself.  Obviously, there is a cost involved
 > when new technologies are introduced. But there is no additional
 > equipment, manpower, or time consumed when you dial *69 to return a
 > call. It's a permanent part of the system. As a comparison, we could
 > say that it also costs money to install a hold button. Imagine how we
 > would feel if we were charged a fee every time we used it.
 > 
 >      The local companies are not the only offenders but it is
 > particularly bad in their case because, for the vast majority of
 > Americans, there is no competition on this level. The same complaints
 > are being voiced concerning cable television companies.
 > 
 >      Long distance telephone companies are also guilty. AT&T, MCI, and
 > Sprint all encourage the use of calling cards. Yet each imposes a
 > formidable surcharge each and every time they're used.  AT&T, for
 > example, charges 13 cents for the first minute of a nighttime call
 > from Washington DC to New York plus an 80 cent surcharge. Since a
 > calling card can only be used to make telephone calls, why are
 > consumers expected to pay an extra fee as if they were doing something
 > above and beyond the normal capability of the card? Again, there is no
 > extra work necessary to complete a calling card call - at least not on
 > the phone company's part. The consumer, on the other hand, must enter
 > up to 25 additional digits. But billing is accomplished merely by
 > computers sending data to each other. Gone are the days of tickets

 > SOCIAL INJUSTICES OF TECHNOLOGY

 > SUMMARY
 > 
 >         The cryptography issue is of particular concern to CPSR.
 > During the past several years CPSR has pursued an extensive study of
 > cryptography policy in the United States.  CPSR has organized public
 > conferences, conducted litigation under the Freedom of Information Act,
 > and has emphasized the importance of cryptography for privacy
 > protection and the need to scrutinize carefully government proposals
 > designed to limit the use of this technology.
 >         To evaluate the Clipper proposal it is necessary to look at a
 > 1987 law, the Computer Security Act, which made clear that in the area
 > of unclassified computing systems, the National Institute of Standards
 > and Technology (NIST) and not the National Security Agency (NSA), would
 > be responsible for the development of technical standards.  The Act
 > emphasized public accountability and stressed open decision-making.
 >         In the spirit of the Act, in 1989 NIST set out to develop a
 > public key cryptography standard.  According to documents obtained by
 > CPSR through the Freedom of Information Act, NIST recommended that the
 > algorithm be "public, unclassified, implementable in both hardware or
 > software, usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based multi-national
 > corporation." However, the Clipper proposal and the full-blown Capstone
 > configuration that resulted is very different: the Clipper algorithm,
 > Skipjack, is classified; public access to the reasons underlying the
 > proposal is restricted; Skipjack can be implemented only in
 > tamper-proof hardware; it is unlikely to be used by multi-national
 > corporations, and the security of Clipper remains unproven.
 >         The Clipper proposal undermines the central purpose of the
 > Computer Security Act.  Although intended for broad use in commercial
 > networks, it was not developed at the request of either U.S. business
 > or the general public.  It does not reflect public goals.
 >         The premise of the Clipper key escrow arrangement is that the
 > government must have the ability to intercept electronic
 > communications.  However, there is no legal basis to support this
 > premise. In law there is nothing inherently illegal or suspect about
 > the use of a telephone.  The federal wiretap statute says only that
 > communication service providers must assist law enforcement execute a
 > lawful warrant.
 >         CPSR supports the review of cryptography policy currently
 > underway at the Department of Commerce.  CPSR also supports the efforts
 > undertaken by the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance to
 > study the full ramifications of the Clipper proposal.  However, we are
 > not pleased about the review now being undertaken at the White House.
 > That effort has led to a series of secret meetings, has asked that
 > scientists sign non-disclosure agreements and accept restrictions on
 > publication, and has attempted to resolve public concerns through
 > private channels.  This is not a good process for the evaluation of a
 > technology that is proposed for the public switched network.
 >         Even if the issues regarding Clipper are resolved favorably,
 > privacy concerns will not go away. Rules still need to be developed
 > about the collection and use of transactional data generated by
 > computer communications.  Several specific steps should be taken.
 > First, the FCC should be given a broad mandate to pursue privacy
 > concerns.  Second, current gaps in the communications law should be
 > filled.  The protection of transactional records is particularly
 > important.  Third, telecommunications companies should be encouraged to
 > explore innovative ways to protect privacy.  "Telephone cards", widely
 > available in other countries, are an ideal way to protect privacy.

 > TESTIMONY
 > 
 >         Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the
 > opportunity to testify today on encryption policy and the Clipper
 > proposal.  I especially wish to thank you Congressman Markey, on behalf
 > of CPSR, for your ongoing efforts on the privacy front as well as your
 > work to promote public access to electronic information.
 >         The cryptography issue is of particular concern to CPSR.
 > During the past several years we have pursued an extensive study of
 > cryptography policy in the United States.  We have organized several
 > public conferences, conducted litigation under the Freedom of
 > Information Act, and appeared on a number of panels to discuss the
 > importance of cryptography for privacy protection and the need to
 > scrutinize carefully government proposals designed to limit the use of
 > this technology.
 >         While we do not represent any particular computer company or
 > trade association we do speak for a great many people in the computer
 > profession who value privacy and are concerned about the government's
 > Clipper initiative.
 >         Today I will briefly summarize our assessment of the Clipper
 > proposal.  Then I would like to say a few words about the current
 > status of privacy protection.
 > 
 > CLIPPER
 >         To put the Clipper proposal in a policy context, I will need to
 > briefly to describe a law passed in 1987 intended to address the roles
 > of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense in the
 > development of technical standards.  The Computer Security Act of 1987
 > was enacted to improve computer security in the federal government, to
 > clarify the responsibilities of the National Institute of Standards and
 > Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency, and to ensure that
 > technical standards would serve civilian and commercial needs.
 >         The law made clear that in the area of unclassified computing
 > systems, NIST and not NSA, would be responsible for the development of
 > technical standards.  It emphasized public accountability and stressed
 > open decision-making.  The Computer Security Act also established the
 > Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board (CSSPAB), charged
 > with reviewing the activities of NIST and ensuring that the mandate of
 > the law was enforced.
 >         The Computer Security Act grew out of a concern that classified
 > standards and secret meetings would not serve the interests of the
 > general public.  As the practical applications for cryptography have
 > moved from the military and intelligence arenas to the commercial
 > sphere, this point has become clear.  There is also clearly a conflict
 > of interest when an agency tasked with signal interception is also
 > given authority to develop standards for network security.
 >         In the spirit of the Computer Security Act, NIST set out in
 > 1989 to develop a public key standard FIPS (Federal Information
 > Processing Standard).  In a memo dated May 5, 1989, obtained by CPSR
 > through the Freedom of Information Act, NIST said that it planned:
 > 
 > to develop the necessary public-key based security standards.  We
 > require a public-key algorithm for calculating digital signatures and
 > we also require a public-key algorithm for distributing secret keys.
 > 
 > NIST then went on to define the requirements of the standard:
 > 
 > The algorithms that we use must be public, unclassified, implementable
 > in both hardware or software, usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based
 > multi-national corporation, and must provide a level of security
 > sufficient for the protection of unclassified, sensitive information
 > and commercial propriety and/or valuable information.
 > 
 >         The Clipper proposal and the full-blown Capstone configuration,
 > which incorporates the key management function NIST set out to develop
 > in 1989, is very different from the one originally conceived by NIST.

 > LEGAL AND POLICY ISSUES
 >         There are also several legal and constitutional issues raised
 > by the government's key escrow proposal.  The premise of the Clipper
 > key escrow arrangement is that the government must have the ability to
 > intercept electronic communications, regardless of the economic or
 > societal costs.  The FBI's Digital Telephony proposal, and the earlier
 > Senate bill 266, were based on the same assumption.
 >         There are a number of arguments made in defense of this
 > position: that privacy rights and law enforcement needs must be
 > balanced, or that the government will be unable to conduct criminal
 > investigations without this capability.
 >         Regardless of how one views these various claims, there is one
 > point about the law that should be made very clear: currently there is
 > no legal basis -- in statute, the Constitution or anywhere else --
 > that supports the premise which underlies the Clipper proposal.  As the
 > law currently stands, surveillance is not a design goal.  General
 > Motors would have a stronger legal basis for building cars that could
 > go no faster than 65 miles per hour than AT&T does in marketing a
 > commercial telephone that has a built-in wiretap capability.  In law
 > there is simply nothing about the use of a telephone that is inherently
 > illegal or suspect.
 >         The federal wiretap statute says only that communication
 > service providers must assist law enforcement in the execution of a
 > lawful warrant.  It does not say that anyone is obligated to design
 > systems to facilitate future wire surveillance.  That distinction is
 > the difference between countries that restrict wire surveillance to
 > narrow circumstances defined in law and those that treat all users of
 > the telephone network as potential criminals.  U.S. law takes the first
 > approach.  Countries such as the former East Germany took the second
 > approach.  The use of the phone system by citizens was considered
 > inherently suspect and for that reason more than 10,000 people were
 > employed by the East German government to listen in on telephone calls.
 >         It is precisely because the wiretap statute does not contain
 > the obligation to incorporate surveillance capability -- the design
 > premise of the Clipper proposal -- that the Federal Bureau of
 > Investigation introduced the Digital Telephony legislation.  But that
 > legislation has not moved forward and the law has remained unchanged.
 > The Clipper proposal attempts to accomplish through the
 > standard-setting and procurement process what the Congress has been
 > unwilling to do through the legislative process.
 >         On legal grounds, adopting the Clipper would be a mistake.
 > There is an important policy goal underlying the wiretap law.  The
 > Fourth Amendment and the federal wiretap statute do not so much balance
 > competing interests as they erect barriers against government excess
 > and define the proper scope of criminal investigation.  The purpose of
 > the federal wiretap law is to restrict the government, it is not to
 > coerce the public.
 >         Therefore, if the government endorses the Clipper proposal, it
 > will undermine the basic philosophy of the federal wiretap law and the
 > fundamental values embodied in the Constitution.  It will establish a
 > technical mechanism for signal interception based on a premise that has
 > no legal foundation.  The assumption underlying the Clipper proposal is
 > more compatible with the practice of telephone surveillance in the
 > former East Germany than it is with the narrowly limited circumstances
 > that wire surveillance has been allowed in the United States.
 > 
 > UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
 >         There are a number of other legal issues that have not been
 > adequately considered by the proponents of the key escrow arrangement
 > that the Subcommittee should examine.  First, not all lawful wiretaps
 > follow a normal warrant process.  The proponents of Clipper should make
 > clear how emergency wiretaps will be conducted before the proposal goes
 > forward.  Second, there may be civil liability issues for the escrow
 > agents, if they are private parties, if there is abuse or compromise of
 > the keys.  Third, there is a Fifth Amendment dimension to the proposed
 > escrow key arrangement if a network user is compelled to disclose his
 > or her key to the government in order to access a communications
 > network. Each one of these issues should be examined carefully.
 > 
 > 
 > CPSR CONFERENCE
 >         At a conference organized by CPSR this week at the Carnegie
 > Endowment for International Peace we heard presentations from staff
 > members at NIST, FBI, NSA and the White House about the Clipper
 > proposal.  The participants at the meeting had the opportunity to ask
 > questions and to exchange views.
 >         Certain points now seem clear:
 > 
 > %       The Clipper proposal was not developed in response to any
 > perceived public or business need.  It was developed solely to address
 > a law enforcement concern.
 > %       Wire surveillance remains a small part of law enforcement
 > investigations.  The number of arrests resulting from wiretaps has
 > remained essentially unchanged since the federal wiretap law was enacted
 > in 1968.
 > %       The potential risks of the Clipper proposal have not been
 > assessed and many questions about the implementation remain unanswered.
 > %       Clipper does not appear to have the support of the business or
 > research community.
 > 
 >         Many comments on the Clipper proposal, both positive and
 > negative as well the materials obtained by CPSR through the Freedom of
 > Information Act, are contained in the Source book compiled by CPSR for
 > the recent conference.  I am please to make a copy of this available to
 > the Subcommittee.
 > 
 > 
 > NETWORK PRIVACY PROTECTION
 >         Communications privacy remains a critical test for network
 > development.  Networks that do not provide a high degree of privacy are
 > clearly less useful to network users.  Given the choice between a
 > cryptography product without a key escrow and one with a key escrow, it
 > would be difficult to find a user who would prefer the key escrow
 > requirement.  If this proposal does go forward, it will not be because
 > network users or commercial service providers favored it.
 >         Even if the issues regarding the Clipper are resolved
 > favorably, privacy concerns will not go away.  Cryptography is a part
 > of communications privacy, but it is only a small part.  Rules still
 > need to be developed about the collection and use of transactional data
 > generated by computer communications.  While the federal wiretap law
 > generally does a very good job of protecting the content of
 > communications against interception by government agencies, large holes
 > still remain.  The extensive use of subpoenas by the government to
 > obtain toll records and the sale of telephone records by private
 > companies are just two examples of gaps in current law.
 >         The enforcement of privacy laws is also a particularly serious
 > concern in the United States.  Good laws without clear mechanisms for
 > enforcement raise over-arching questions about the adequacy of legal
 > protections in this country.  This problem is known to those who have
 > followed developments with the Privacy Act since passage in 1974 and
 > the more recent Video Privacy and Protection Act of 1988.  I make this
 > point because it has been the experience in other countries that
 > agencies charged with the responsibility for privacy protection can be
 > effective advocates for the public in the protection of personal
 > privacy.
 > 
 > RECOMMENDATIONS
 >         Regarding the Clipper proposal, we believe that the national
