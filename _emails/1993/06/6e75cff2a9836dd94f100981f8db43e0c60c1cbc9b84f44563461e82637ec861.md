Of course, it seems perfectly obvious to Markey that 2600
is a "handbook on crime", but EG should have turned around
and pointed out that he's just transmitting information on
the world and there is nothing wrong with that. Gosh, if
there was then Congressional Hearings and C-Span should
be rated R to prevent the little whippersnappers from seeing
and hearing demonstrations like the one that John Gage gave
the committee several weeks ago. 

One person commented that Time magazine's latest article on
Crack was practically a "How-To" guide. It satisfied the
"Enquiring Minds" that wanted to know just what those people
did with the magic crystals. 

Another friend informs me that Pornography is often transmitted
with the label "For Scientific Research purposes only." Apparently,
the law contains some exception for Doctors and Biologists. Hmmm. 
I wonder where Masters and Johnson fit in here.
