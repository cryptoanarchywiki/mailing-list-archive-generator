First, this is only true when the file is ASCII armored.  You can
easily convert the file from armor to binary once you receive it and
then keep it in binary form.  Second, if the file is encrypted, it
only contains the KeyID(s) of the recipient(s) in plain text, not the
sender.

This is not necessrily true.  I've been thinking of a way to try this.
Don't forget, you only have a limited number of secret keys to try, so
you try them all.  How many keys could you have?  10, maybe?  At most?
I, personally, only have one secret key.  I could try it, and if it
fails, I know I couldn't read the file....

Basically, Hal, you are stretching the "problem" further than it needs
to go, IMHO.  Relax a little and take a look at what you have at your
fingertips.  :-)
