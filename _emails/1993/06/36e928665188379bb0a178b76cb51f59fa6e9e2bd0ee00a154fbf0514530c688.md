If you know that your plaintext is 7-bit ASCII, then you can reject if
you see too many 8th bits set.  Assuming that the size of your
intercepted ciphertexts is generous, say ten blocks, then the
likelihood of a false decryption which has all the 8th bits off is
extremely small.  Hint for implementors: don't allow such easy bit
correlations in your plaintext.

In any case, the point of a DES cracker is to reduce the size of the
space of probable decryptions, so that more computationally expensive
statistical tests of possible plaintexts may be performed on a shorter
list.  If your cracker can reduce the size of the probable keyspace by
eight bits, then you can run, in parallel, tests which take 2^8 times
as long.  For example, you may be able to reject many potential
plaintexts from a CBC ciphertext stream after the first block; longer
tests would look at a longer stream.

This is where measures of n-gram distribution really come into their
own.  These measures can distinguish between text types extremely
finely, but are often expensive.  Nevertheless, they are highly suited
to automation, particularly to distinguish between different languages
and to recognize non-linguistic forms such as protocol encapsulations,
object code, and compressed text.
