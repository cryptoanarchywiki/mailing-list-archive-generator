Help!!
 
I don't have Usenet access, so I can't post this on the 
pgp newsgroup, and this is the only other place I know of 
to ask this...
 
I just got pgp23.zip and pgp23src.zip from soda, and I 
can't make it give valid signatures with the -a option 
(well, actually the Armor=on line in the config.txt 
file)!  It will work correctly if Armor=off, and if the 
file is also encrypted, but a straight signature with 
ascii armor appended to the message doesn't work.  Even 
pgp22 gives me an invalid signature "doesn't match 
contents" message!
 
Has anyone else had this problem with 2.3?  I've even re-
compiled with Borland C++ 3.1, and get the same problem.
