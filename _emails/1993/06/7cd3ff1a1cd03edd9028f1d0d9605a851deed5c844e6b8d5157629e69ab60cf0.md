	 Does this really happen?  WOW!

Does it happen?  Sure did circa 20 years ago, when individual members
of Congress had much less computing capacity.  I wrote to members of
the House Judiciary committee demanding the impeachment of a certain
unindicted co-conspirator.  Over the next few years, I received a
variety of funds solicitation letters, as some of those folks tried
to move on to bigger and better offices.  The letters invariably
spoke of the members' ``bravery and courage of conviction'' during
the Watergate investigation, and noted my interest in that subject...
