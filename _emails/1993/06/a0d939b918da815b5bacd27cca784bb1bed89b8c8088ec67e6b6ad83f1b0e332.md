Actually, I've implimented much of this in telix, using it's (C-like) script
language.  From the command line, I can type in the name of a batch file.  That
batch file starts telix, logs me in, sends any mail I have created/encrypted on
my machine, and downloads all my new mail, to be read from another batch file.
My mail reader batch file uses pgp to read my mail and presents a nice message
selection menu, too.  Totally transparent, and automated.  I'm quite prowd of
it.  The only thing to do is clean it up a bit, and impliment reply-quoting.
That should be done by the end of the week.  If any one is interested in what
I have.....ask me.

BTW, I have had a few bug reports on my pgp menu batch file for 4dos.  I will 
also have it fixed by the end of the week and will release it next week.
