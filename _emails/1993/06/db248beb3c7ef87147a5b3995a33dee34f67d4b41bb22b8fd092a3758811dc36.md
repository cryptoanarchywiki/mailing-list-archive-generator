	 I think this neither ominous nor foreboding.  This statement was
	 apparent within a week or so of the original announcement.  The only
	 thing new about it is that it confirms what I've thought for over a
	 month: that the executive branch is trying to do an end run around the
	 legislature.

Well, it could be innocent; it just takes longer to get legislation
passed.  Yeah, that's it...

Of course, NSA does have another option -- they can disclose how
cheaply they can crack DES.  (That they can crack it I don't doubt; my
only question is what it costs them per solution, including
amortization of capital costs.)
