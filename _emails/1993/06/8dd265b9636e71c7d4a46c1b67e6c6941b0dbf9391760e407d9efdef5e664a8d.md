As much as we need this, we also need the actual text of the patents.
What a patent actually covers is often much narrower than what is
claimed.

The experience of others trying to gather such information as this is
that you have to be proactive if you expect to get anything done.
Waiting for people to send you stuff is an exercise in patience.
