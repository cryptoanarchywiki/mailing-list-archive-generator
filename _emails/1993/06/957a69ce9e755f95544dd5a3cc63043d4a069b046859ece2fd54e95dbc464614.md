I agree that the PC-centric BBS world has decided that Kermit is obsolete.

Kermit is continually improving and is very nearly as fast as ZMODEM.
It is available for nearly all platforms, is free, and source is availilbe.
It includes NASI support directly. It has a very nice (powerful) scripting
language. It also works over TCP/IP networks for folks with the luck
to be Ethernet'd into the Internet (like most of the faculty and staff here
at GMU). It also has very strong backward compatibility.

I expect that Kermit is good enuff if you are interested in commandline
scripts for plain old DOS. And the scripting language is also
supported by the C version that run on nearly all Unixs and most other
boxes. This would allow a single script to support a lot of users.
I'm not interestedin DOS and command lines, but if some other
cypherpunk wants to try, I'm sure not going to complain.
