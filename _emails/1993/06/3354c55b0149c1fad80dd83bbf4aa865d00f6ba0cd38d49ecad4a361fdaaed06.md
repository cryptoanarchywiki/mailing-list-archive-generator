Well, nobody told me whether a message did or did not get through, but
I'm now sure they didn't.  All of the failed messages have blank lines
before the :: token, which is consequently not recognized by recurse.pl.
I dunno how they got in there, but I guess I should learn some perl and
robustify against this -- unless somebody can think of a reason why ::
needs to be able to start a message without being stripped.  Damned in-band
signalling...
