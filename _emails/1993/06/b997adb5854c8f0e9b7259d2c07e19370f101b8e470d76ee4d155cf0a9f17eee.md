Well, I really used only 5 different remailers, total of 16 hops.  I Should haf
made that clearer.

The ones I used were:

hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu
hh@cicada.berkeley.edu
hh@soda.berkeley.edu
hal@alumni.caltech.edu
hfinney@shell.portal.com

This message will go through 24 hops, just for the heck of it.
