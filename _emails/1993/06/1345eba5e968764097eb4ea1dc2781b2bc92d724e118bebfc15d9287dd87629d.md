I'm not so sure that all this Bidzos Biz is as evil as it may sound.
Consider the management have an obligation to the stockholders to make
money.  Now here is a huge market.  Do they turn it down on the basis of
political rectitude...?

Are we seriously expecting that Bidzos will refrain from tapping into this
market, and refrain from charging a cent for an RSA-PGP thing...?  Oh, okay,
so he's supposed to go into poverty to prove his ethics.  Oh, I see.  Gee
whiz, I thought I was the most socialistic of anyone on this list.
