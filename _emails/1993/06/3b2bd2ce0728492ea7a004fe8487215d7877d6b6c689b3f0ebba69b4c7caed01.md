Another way in which incoming and outgoing messages can be linked up
in a remailer is the Subject line.  Most of the remailers keep this the
same for incoming and outgoing messages.

Most of the remailers also have the ability to let the user change the
subject line as it goes through the remailer.  My "chain" program which
I put on soda lets you set the subject line but only in the last remailer
of the chain (so that it goes to the destination with the right subject).
If more people did that and we also adopted the convention of not having
a subject line at all for the mail up to that point, then all mail through
the remailers would have no subject and it would all look the same.

(Actually, my mailer won't conveniently let me have no subject, so I would
either have to have a blank subject or some default string.)
