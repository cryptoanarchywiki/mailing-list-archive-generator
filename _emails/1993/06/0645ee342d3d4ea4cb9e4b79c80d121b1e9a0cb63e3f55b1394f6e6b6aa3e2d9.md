This subject came up here a few months ago.  I can report that
I was able to post to the rec.video.cable-tv newsgroup anonymously
through the wimsey remailer plus group-name@cs.utexas.edu.

Send the following to

   Remailer <remail@extropia.wimsey.com>

all PGP encrypted with key

   pub  1024/B5A32F 1992/12/13  Remailer <remail@extropia.wimsey.com>

To: group-name@cs.utexas.edu
Subject: <subject to appear in post>
<blank line>
Text to appear in anonymous post to newsgroup "group-name"

"Group-name" is the name of the newsgroup with dashes "-" substituted
for periods ".".  Where the name already contains a dash, just leave
it alone.  So, for example, rec.video.cable-tv becomes
rec-video-cable-tv.

Note that with the wimsey remailer, anything not encrypted is
discarded, so no need to worry about your automatic sig.

Here is how the anonymous post appears:

[Newsgroup rec.video.cable-tv]

Post: 614 of 619
From: anonymous@extropia.wimsey.com (Anonymous)
Newsgroups: rec.video.cable-tv
Subject: TCI San Jose Free(?) Extended Basic
Date: 26 Jun 1993 05:50:28 -0500
Organization: UTexas Mail-to-News Gateway
Lines: 34
NNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu

Here in San Jose, CA, TCI recently cut the price of "basic" cable
in half, but made a corresponding increase in the fee for "extended"
...
So the conclusion is,  cancel extended basic immediately. At worst
you're losing a vastly overpriced service; at best, you're losing
nothing at all, and saving $15/month!!
[end of post - no trailer]

This apparently works to any newsgroup, which function Julf got in
trouble for providing.  Use and enjoy!  We'll see what happens to
UTexas or Wimsey.

There is also apparently a new Julf-like forwarder that just appeared.
To get more info, send a message to:
