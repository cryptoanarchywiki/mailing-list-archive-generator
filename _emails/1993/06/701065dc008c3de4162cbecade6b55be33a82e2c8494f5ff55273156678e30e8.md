Oh please, not a flame...  I'm trying to create something here, and I need
a lot of help, since everyone seems to know exactly how this should be
done but none of them want to actually get off of their heinies and write
it.  The last thing that I need is to start getting flamed, the whole
project will rapidly go down the tubes...

I am paying very close attention to the suggestions on overall format, you
may have noticed that my concept has changed from a hardware PGP
encryption of the entire disk with PCMIA keys to a more realistic DES
software encryption through device drivers and multiple partitions.  

I am certainly not closed off to ideas, and the last thing I need, as I
said before, is to start getting flamed.

I am certainly not neglecting either issue, performance is one of the main
reasons why I am interested in NOT doing sector remapping and compression
along with the encryption, and I am trying to find a convinient method for
keeping keys that an end user would be happy with.

Among the suggestions at hand:

	An ISA card with the key burned into EEPROMS and a keypad attached 
	for verification of user ID

	PCMIA cards holding keys and a mandatory PCMIA slot

	Users typing long keys in manually

	Keys held on floppy disks

	Keys held on the HD itself

I believe that keys held on floppies with password verification to be the
most feasable, the easiest and the most likely to be understood and
accepted by end users.

Please stop flaming me, I'm doing the best I can here...

Yes, I can see the advantages of using a device driver for this
application.  I am now doing research on just that.  The idea of setting
up the initial version to simply pass through data unharmed is also a very
useful suggestion.  Thank you.

Is it just my impression or did you just tell me that

	1) DES is too slow to use, I am stupid for trying.

	2) DES is what I should use.

What the hell did I do to deserve getting flamed by someone who I so
respected about ten minutes ago?  Do you instinctively do this because I
don't yet understand a few highly technical concepts yet?  Would you
rather this whole project just get scrapped just because I am not yet as
proficient in this area as you?  How did you learn, did people flame you
when you tried to create something and asked for advice?  What the hell,
I'm just trying to help.

You talk about how I should be careful about inadvertently trampling on the
people giving me advice.  I am sorry I certainly did not mean to (and I
think that you will notice that later in the message I specifically
thanked him several times for his input) but what about you specifically
and intentionally insulting the guy who is actually trying to WRITE the thing?

I have other things to do, I am a professional programmer and I get payed
plenty to write code for other people.  What I am doing here is trying to
write some code for EVERYONE for FREE and I am VOLUNTEERING my time. (lots
of it, I might add)

I see.  How do codebook and counter mode relate to the layering that I
hear about (ie, single, double, triple DES) are these simply single or
multiple layers of these modes, or did I miss something?  (I still have a
shortage of good cypto books at my command, I have three that I think will
be very helpful on order at the local university library)

I agree about length and multitude.  How does the key length affect the
speed of the algorithm?

I am also concerned about having the keys sitting around in memory once
they are read from the disk.  This would just open the system up to
somebody running a key scanning program on your system and grabbing the
keys right out of memory.  I'm still not sure what to do about this.  It
is a really good reason to go to PCMIA cards with the PCMIA DMA mapped in
the future, but I can't quite think of a good solution right now...

Yes, that shouldn't be any problem.  I am thinking more an more that the
guys who wrote Stacker knew what they were doing... I forsee a seperate
utility program which would sit around on the uncompressed partition for
dealing with keys and such, this would be where I would handle key backups.

I thought of this as well as a possible solution to the problem of having
the key sitting around in memory, but it really seems to me like a great
way to lose data by crashing programs.  I just don't see how I could make
it timeout gracefully and not crash whatever is running.  Something that I
did think of though, is tying the timer into the int 24 routine which
terminates program execution, so that if enough time had passed it would
shut down the drive, but only AFTER you have exited your program.  This
would provide the timer support and still not be horrible likely to wreck
the hell out of something and kill some data.

This looks awfully flamish to me too, but I'll let it pass...

I think that this is likely to be the biggest problem with my system as I
am considering it.  An obvious way around this would be to use a system
which does sector remapping and stores the entire file system in one huge
file a la Stacker, so that we don't need to actually physically partition
the disk.  I can think about how to implement a system like this after I
get a non-sector indexing system working.

I think that a system like the aforementioned would be possible to
painlessly install with an installation program just like the one that
Stacker uses to painlessly turn your disk into two virtual disks, one
stacked and the other the boot disk, with no backing up and repartitioning
involved.

Much as the flamage has ticked me off, you have provided some of the most
helpful information and suggestions to date and I very much appreciate
your help.  I still truly don't understand what I did to provoke you,
other than working on a crypto project, but I do appreciate your help.

I can only hope that I caught you late at night or something or perhaps
just misunderstood the severity of your insults.
