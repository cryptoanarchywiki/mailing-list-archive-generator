I don't doubt it for a second, but I know it definitely will lock up a
real 8088.  Also there is a problem with DesqView in some cases.

 Uu> Probably far more XT boxes running, worldwide, than some
 Uu> are capable of imagining.

I'm sure of that, too.  PGP is a worldwide phenomenon, & there are a
whole lot of XT-class computers in the outside world.

 Uu> Key generation on the XT is as exciting... and as fast...
 Uu> as a baseball game...

Well, more like _cricket_, actually. 8-)

 Uu> Encryption speed is more than adequate.

Considering the math involved, yes.  Still even a 20MHz 286 fairly flies
doing PGP tasks in comparison, though.
