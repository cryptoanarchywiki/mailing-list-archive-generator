This episode was hilarious.  An imprisoned El Rukun was conducting gang
business via jailhouse payphone.  One chuckly FBI agent was "decoding"
the simple slang-code by which the goons communicated.  After _three
months_ he figured out enough of the code to bring an indictment.  Some
of the more amusing of these sophisticated subterfuges:

Peanut = Jimmy Carter
Hollywood = Ronald Reagan
Roman = Policeman
Change = Kill
Our Friend = Qadaffi
Long Demonstration = Shotgun

It's interesting to note the length of time required for this "plaintext"
to be decoded in an urgent matter of national security.
