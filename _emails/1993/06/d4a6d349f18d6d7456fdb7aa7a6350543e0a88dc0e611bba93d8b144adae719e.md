That's the answer to the question:

"The US Government violates 9 of the 10 amendments of the Bill of Rights 
every second of every day.  What is the one Amendment of the 10 that 
they hold inviolate?"

The Third:

      3rd Amendment
      No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house, 
      without the consent of the owner; nor in time of war, but in a 
      manner to be prescribed by law. 

Say, maybe that's an argument against the Clipper Chip!  Aren't the NSA 
types sort of soldiers who want to be quartered in our telephones at our 
expense?
