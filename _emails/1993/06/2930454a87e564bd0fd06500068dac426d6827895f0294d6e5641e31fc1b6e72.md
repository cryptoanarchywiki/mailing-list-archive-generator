I'm all for cypherpunk code-writing; I'm all for crypto for the
masses. In fact, I'm working it on a real-time basis, boys and girls.
 
Somehow, I feel a bit slighted, and it goes a little beyond myself, if
it need be known. I'm really not stupid enough to squeak without
provocation. :-)
 
I'd like to, additionally, see a sub-paragraph in the FAQ concerning
non-code-writing exploits, such as the tedious task of accosting
politicos. Is this not a desired activity?
 
I shudder to think that cypherpunks would corner themselves in a
manner which would exclude political maneuvers. IMHO, any cypherpunk
who would close themselves off from political fire is either brilliant
or idiotic, dependent upon method or mentality.
 
Me -- I'll take the questionable route; I would rather get the answers
I seek, sow the seeds of incongruity and ask questions of pertinent
people.
 
I'm asking that Eric Raymond add to "What do Cypherpunks do?" lineage,
"Cypherpunks also do a lot of monkey-wrench work."
 
We also run political gauntlets. We also draw attention, while other
projects are accomplished. We also encourage other politico brethren
of internationalities to join us in our struggle for electronic and
cryptographic independence.
 
We also interface with those turkeys on capitol hill (non-caps).
 
Cypherpunks do more than write simple code -- we set precedence, we
deliver technology.
 
Cheers.
