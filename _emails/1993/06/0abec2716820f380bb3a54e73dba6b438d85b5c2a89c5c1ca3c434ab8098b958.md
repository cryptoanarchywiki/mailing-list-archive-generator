For those of you who don't follow RISKS Digest (comp.risks):
you're really missing some good stuff. At the risk of redundantly
posting messages which may have already been discussed, I couldn't
resist the opportunity to cross-post this portion of a response to
Peter Junger's original post on "Risks of teaching the law without
breaking it," where Mr. Junger expresses his displeasure and
confoundedness of the export restrictions on simple (and all)
cryptography.

 I think that if you give your students copies of your comp.risks
 article, they should all be sufficiently disheartened with American
 law that they will quit the program and you can then present your
 lectures to a class devoid of foreign (or any) students.
 
 Alternatively, you could check passports at the door, and boot out
 foreign students during the parts of your class which are essential
 to American Sickurity.  By doing so you will raise eyebrows well
 outside of the computer-and-law sphere of interest and you may bring
 this ludicrous situation into the limelight.  But then, you may get
 sacked.
 
 Probably a much more effective solution to your problem, and one which
 has recently been proven perfectly legal and acceptable in an American
 court, would be for you to merely shoot dead all the foreigners in your
 class, after which you can speak freely.
