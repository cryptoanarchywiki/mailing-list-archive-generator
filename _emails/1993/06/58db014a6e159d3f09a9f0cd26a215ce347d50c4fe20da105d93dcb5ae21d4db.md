We build the privacy into the system, not the government.  The
question is _who decides_?  If we decide by creating, then more
privacy will exist by fiat.

>The only way to ensure your privacy is to seize it yourself.

Absolutely.  This does not contradict our activity of building the
privacy into the system.  Any privacy system you can build on top of
an insecure network such as the internet can also be built on top of a
privacy-friendly network.

One of the really great techniques I've hear about recently is a data
channel that runs at 90% T1 speed over the ~900 MHz spread spectrum
band.  The legal limit is 1W transmitter power and 4W antenna gain
(transmitted energy focusing).  From what I hear, though, the antenna
gain requirements are being ignored by lots of folks.  What this means
in practice is that you can set up a directional antenna and easily
get a twenty mile hop on one of these units.

Cylink has had a T1 link encrypter out for years.  It uses D-H for key
exchange.  It's also costs (not-known-to-be-accurate) about 10K$ per
end.
