I was rooting around soda for some other reason and stumbled upon the
mail logs (!) for soda.  I just sent myself some mail to generate a
sample entry.  It's got complete traffic analysis data, complete with
to/from pairs, time of day, and message size.

I would recommend that all remailer operators find out what kind of
mail logging, if any, takes place on their machines.  If you need a
place to start looking, the mail log on soda was in the same directory
as the syslog messages.

I would also recommend that this information on mail logging by the
system be put in Karl's remailer list.
