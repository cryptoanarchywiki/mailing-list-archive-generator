Your PGP *utilities* source for the BBS side of things in back online again,
though there still remain some hardware probs of nasty proportions.  I
have upped the online time for the ANONYMOUS, password GUEST, account so
you can get the larger stuff.  See .sig for info.   Note that FREQing may
not work after the next Fido nodelist comes out, but that will only be
temporary. 

I have the latest PGPShell (2.1), plus some innovative Fido-tech
networking crypto goodies.  I'd likely UL them to soda, but I was told
that if it doesn't come with source code don't bother.  Slightly
frustrating, but oh well that's not my site.  Anyway, got lots of other
such goodies too, for Unix, and about 6 other platforms, including various
shell and Perl scripts, NeXT diffs, etc.

Disclaimer: Due to legal threats from RSADSI/PKP, I am not able to provide
PGP itself.

Anyone know if it would be legal to provide it in "kit form" (source code)?
