the FOIA request looks very interesting
and im near positive that something is on me somewhere
just becuase i have the wrong type of friends who keep
me in their address books

but how bad will it look if i actually make the request?
and will it mean that i am more likely to have people pay attention to me?
and how much info shoudl i include about myself?




{% endraw %}
