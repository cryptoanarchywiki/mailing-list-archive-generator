I read this, and without knowing if anyone else has replied, it looks like
a need for an explanation of how to get more environment space in DOS.  Is
it that you don't know how to increase the DOS environment size, or does it
still not work even if you have increased it?  OBdisclaimer:  I don't know
4DOS, just regular old MS/PC DOS...  and maybe a little DRDOS.  :-)
