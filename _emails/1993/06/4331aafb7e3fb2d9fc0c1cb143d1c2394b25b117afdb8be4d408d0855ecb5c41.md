Note that _this_ message goes through an RBBS/UUCP gate.  The problem
remains, however.  On the other hand, I just noted a sheepish message
about the remailer@rebma.mn.org being ill for the past couple of weeks,
which would explain my failures with that system.

An interesting experiment I shall try today, perhaps with this very
message.  Thank's, Hal, for the input.  I should like to see these
remailers popularized, along with encryption, as one of the best
political moves we cypherpunks can make.  De-glitching them for broader
use may be a thankless task, but would be worth it if it results in
their general use.

P.S.:  Have you heard anything of the alleged bug with version 2.3 being
unable to verify plaintext PGP signatures?
