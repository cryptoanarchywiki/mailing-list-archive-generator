 Agreed. There are many, many things that we need to do to support
 opposition to this ruse.

 Hear, hear.

 Very lucid and wise observation. I have suggested several times that
 attention should also be directed to the (what I call) "potential
 factor" in regards to the entire "key escrow" system. The potential
 for abuse and unconstitutional invasions of personal privacy are ripe
 for the picking under this scheme. In my own public comment letter to
 the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board, I stressed
 this fact and also pointed out that although the system was probably
 designed with good intentions (right), it will not prevent zealots
 and spooks from monitoring communications under certain
 circumstances.
 
 My other peeve is that after this "technology" has been entrenched
 (read: forced) on the public, I see the rug being pulled out from
 under the feet of any other crypto system available. That's also why
 I attach a great deal of importance to some form of PGP being
 developed where all parties (Phil Z., Jim B., and me) are happy
 (excluding Uncle S.). (But I suppose that's another topic...)
 
 Patriotically yours,
