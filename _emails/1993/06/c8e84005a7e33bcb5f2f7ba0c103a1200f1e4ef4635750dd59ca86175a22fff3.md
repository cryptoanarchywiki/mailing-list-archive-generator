Some solutions:

1. Make programs like "readdat.exe" ubiquitous...distribute them on
shareware disks, CD-ROMs, etc. Thus, many households and offices will
have "readdat.exe"-like programs, whether they use them or not. Mere
possession of such a program will thus not be unusual or
suspicion-provoking. (This is of course one of the strategies in
making PGP and related programs ubiquitous.)

(Note that the storage of the _key_ is another matter, and is a
problem with most crypto schemes. For data stored in low-order bits on
a DAT, and retrievable with "readdat.exe," a pass-phrase of sufficient
length can be used.)

2. The bit-reading program "readdat.exe" can be stored remotely,
perhaps at an ftp site, so the user can retrieve it only when he needs
to use it, then flush it.

(I favor the "ubiquitous" route, as frequent retrievals make
themselves known in other ways....and may even draw attention to a
user in the first place.)
