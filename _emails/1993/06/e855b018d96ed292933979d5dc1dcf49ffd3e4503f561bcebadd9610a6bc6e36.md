We're not.  I was very tired and was using my other, much smaller, brain to 
think with. ;^)  I was (thinking?) of distributing a common secret key to people
who we know are not spooks, and who would be interested in the cypherpunk's
cause.  This and anonymous remailers would ensure that anyone could say anything
with total anonymity, since we would all share secret keys.  The problem is, of
course, that many people who would otherwise be interested, could not 
participate in our new clique. ;^(  SO, DISREGUARD MY COMMENTS!  Plz!
