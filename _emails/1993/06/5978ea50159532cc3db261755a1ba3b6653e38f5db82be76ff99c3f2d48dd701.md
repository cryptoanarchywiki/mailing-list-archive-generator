While the pseudo-random bit sequence algorithm used in the Computer Shopper
article is weak, it is important to note that the article is on the right
track.  However, a one time pad based on PRBS is only as secure as the PRBS
itself.  If the author did not state this, he was remiss.

There *are* cryptographically strong pseudo-random bit generators.  A one
time pad based on a CSPRBS would be as secure as the underlying 'hard'
problem.  For example, Blum and Micali's paper "How to Generate
Cryptographically Strong Sequences of Pseudo-Random Bits" (Nov. 84 SIAM),
details a scheme based on the discrete log problem.

Essentially, this system is based on selecting bits from successive
exponentiations of a seed.  If you could guess the next bit to be selected,
without knowing the seed, you could reverse this into an algorithm to solve
the discrete log problem.

The Blum and Micali paper also references a paper by Shamir (which I have
not read) called "On the generation of cryptographically strong
pseudo-random sequences" 8th International Colloquium on Automata,
Languages and Programming, Lecture Notes in Coputer Science, 62,
Spring-Verlag, New York, 1981.  The difference being that the Shamir scheme
generates *numbers* while the Blum/Micali scheme generates *bits*.

I try never to label anyone a moron until I am sure their stupidity is not
just my failure to communicate.
