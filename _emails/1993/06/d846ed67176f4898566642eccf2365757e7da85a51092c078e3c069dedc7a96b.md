	How about a header line such as:

X-Cut-End-Lines: 6
	Which would instruct the remailer to cut the last six lines off the
mail message as it receives it. Thus a user could figure out how many
lines at the end of his message is added on without his control and
instruct the remailer to cut out that amount of lines.
