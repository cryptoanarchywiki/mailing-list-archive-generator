No.  toad.com is overloaded as it is.  It's slow as molasses already,
and adding any encryption at all to cypherpunks would make it even
worse.  Even forking a process per user would be way to much.

As I said before, any experimentation that people want to do with list
distribution can be done by hacking the current remailer code.  You
don't have to have any sysadmin privileges to do this.  You don't even
have to have my permission to do this.
