This PKP announcement is the last straw.  This is clearly a case of the
federal policy/procurement bureaucracy going completely out of control.
The way things ran under Bush, except if they tried to pull this blatant
a deal their bluff would have been called immediately.  

I think it's time to demand the White House put a total moratorium on
all policies related to digital and telecommunications data and privacy
until they can extract themselves from this quicksand.

And if they won't do that, it's time to kick some *serious* political butt.

Don't you let that deal go down!
