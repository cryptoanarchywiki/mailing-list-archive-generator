how fast is fast des these days?  (i have measured over 2 mbps
on decent workstations.)

i was in a meeting today attended by someone from nsa who said
that 2.4 gbps des chips exists today.  (he got real silent after
blurting this out.  hmm.)

2.4 gbps is 37.5 million des per sec.

it is probably not much challenge to put together a 65,536 element
machine, which would run at 2.5 trillion des per sec.  if i have my
arithmetic right, this could exhaustively test the space of 56 bit
keys in about eight hours.
