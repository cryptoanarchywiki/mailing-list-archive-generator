I have opened my mouth and removed all doubt.  I _am_ mostly
illiterate in the details of Unix; this is one system administration
detail I did not know.  I have known for a long time that these logs
were in principle easy for administration to keep, but I did not know
that they were an entirely standard feature.

I raise this because it affects perceived remailer security and I have
not once heard these specific logs brought up, on the list or in person.

Eric
