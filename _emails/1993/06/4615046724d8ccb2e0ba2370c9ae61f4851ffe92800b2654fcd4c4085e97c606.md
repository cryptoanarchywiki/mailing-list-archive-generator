My guess would be that it can't be done.  Just getting up in a
light aircraft with a cell phone is instructive.  With every
cell site in 50 miles being about the same distance (even from 
LEO) I don't think you could pick out a single conversation.

On the other hand, with enough directionality . . . . nah, the
antenna would be a monster.
