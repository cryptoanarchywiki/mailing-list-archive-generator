I'm really intrigued by the technology known as TEMPEST.  If a guy had a mind 
to, is it possible to put together a do-it-yourself "tempest-aware" machine?
That is, could a guy buy supplies that would make his machine "quiet?"  If so,
would someone please tell me how!  This would be very usefull to many 
cypherpunks and would be of (IMHO) general interest.  Thanx in advance.
 
 
BTW, this message was mailed by my pgp-aware, automatic mail script.
