This is a serious misfeature.  An essential goal of remailer design is that  
they be stateless.  A message is forwarded, then immediately forgotten.  Any  
historical information about messages that have gone through is a potential  
weakness.  Message serial numbers are a perfect audit trail.

Consider cryptographic secret-sharing protocols.  If we have 20 remailers,  
each remailer could split his key into 20 pieces, 15 of which would be  
necessary to reconstruct the key.  When a remailer goes down, the key could  
be reconstructed and given to a substitute remailer.  The system can survive  
the loss of 5 remailers, and would require a collaboration of 15, or 3/4 of  
the remailer operators to intentionally break the security.
