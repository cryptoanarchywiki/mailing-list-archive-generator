	This secret sharing *does* look very appealling.
	How would the substitute remailer be chosen? Very difficult to
build, however, as it would require a great deal of similarity between
remailer software.
	How can a key be split into 20 pieces while only requiring [any?] 15
to work? Redundancy?

	It would be a good idea to have two sorts of keys for each
remailer, maybe. One key for normal usage and another key for
communication between remailers, key-part distribution, etc.
