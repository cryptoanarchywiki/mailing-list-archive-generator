What about some form of my letter as the form letter petition?

Not as critical as I was, of course.

But STRESS issues he used in his campaign (Prescott Bush, opposing
Vietnam); and maybe one of his flunkies will have the smarts to
cope with it.  The email response for the form letter from
postmaster@whitehouse.gov was very fast, so they have put money
into it.  Maybe they actually DO give a damn.  Try it.
