# 1993-06-04 - Lobbying for Cryptoprivacy, non-U.S. Non-U.S. citizens can lobby hard to get all phones containing key-escrow (aka wiretap) chips banned in your country.  You have a  very good argument: do y'all want Yankee spooks listening in on your  phone calls?  Make sure the following specifics are included in the  legislation:

	 * Try to get key escrow banned *in general*, instead of just from foreign
	 countries.  In smaller countries this will be easier since its doubtful
	 small governments can set up a spook/chip-maker axis to rival the
	 NSA/Mykotronx/VLSI axis in the U.S.  In fact probably only the U.S.,
	 cooperating major European countries and Japan have such a capability.

	 * Be careful with the wording of the legislation; be sure to
	 specify *key-escrow* and not any other forms of cryptography.

This is extremely dangerous.  Much of legislation is compromise.  Any
such bill is probably so close to a bill that outlaws cryptography (or
could be interpreted as a precedent for such a bill) that the risks
are probably far greater than the rewards.  The strategy the Eric
Hughes proposed sounds much better.
