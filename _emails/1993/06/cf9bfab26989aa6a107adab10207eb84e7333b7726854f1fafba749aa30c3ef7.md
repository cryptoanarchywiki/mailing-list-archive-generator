     In an effort to make creating more traffic for the Cypherpunks
remailers easier, I have added a feature to my remailer.  Whenever it
receives a message that would otherwise be remailed but contains a
header line saying "X-Discard:" it will discard the message and act as
though it got remailed.  If all of the Cypherpunks remailers supported
an automatic discard feature, we could setup cron jobs or whatever kind
of software we want to send "junk mail" to the remailers that does not
get forwarded on.

     An idea I just had was to make the X-Discard have a counter.  If
the number is greater than zero, decrement it and forward the message
to another known remailer.  If it is less than one or non-numeric,
discard the message.  Right now, it just discards whatever message
has that header.
