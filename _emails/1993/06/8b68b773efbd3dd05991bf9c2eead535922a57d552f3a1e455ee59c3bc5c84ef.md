 I was not aware that people still used that version of a computer.
An 8088????

Not everyone can afford to buy a new computer.  I myself am using a 286,
because though I want to buy a faster computer, I have no spare money.
I am using VMS to connect to the net for a similar reason.  I can't afford
my own net connection, so I borrow someone else's.  VMS with multinet is 
considerably better for net.connections than turds in a toilet.  And an 8088
is considerably better for encryption and word processing than a pencil and
paper.

Don't be so arrogant.
