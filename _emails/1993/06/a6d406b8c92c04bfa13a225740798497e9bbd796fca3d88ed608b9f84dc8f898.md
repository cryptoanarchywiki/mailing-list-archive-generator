Currently that is the easiest way, to be sure.  Another way would be
to store the passphrase encrypted in a file so that at least it's not
findable with strings(1).  Here a quick hack for someone who's looking
for a project: a passphrase storage process which accepts requests
from a slightly modified PGP.

Hal's basic point, however is not mitigated.  Nothing is secure from a
clever root.

An excellent suggestion.
