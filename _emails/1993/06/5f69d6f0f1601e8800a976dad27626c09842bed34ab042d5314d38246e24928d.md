Yes, the .tar.Z file should have everything you want.
Most of the work is already done for you.
The program comes as a server (link) but there is also
a test client (connect) that I wrote to test out the
protocol.  If you edit the makefile and include the
defines DEBUG and SOCKET link and connect will be
built to use a socket as I/O and will talk to
each other.  If you wish to use it over a serial
line you can take the connect client and modify
it to use a serial device instead of the socket.
