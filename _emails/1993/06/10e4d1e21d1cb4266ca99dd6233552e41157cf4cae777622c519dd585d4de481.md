Well, I have to suggest telix. ;^)  Telix has built in hooks for external
protocols which you could use to impliment your encryption link.  It has a very
good script language.  Further, I have been using it for some time now and think
I am pretty good with it.  I could help you get it going.

Telix is relatively small, has many features, and the script language is very
modular.  It isn't src distribution, though.  Still it's a thought.
