Not having heard of CERT before, and living ten minutes away from their
offices at SEI, i checked out their anonymous ftp site (cert.org) and
found the CERT faq in the pub directory.  From the info THEY provide, it
seems like a worthwhile organization.  BUT, in their info, they deal with
security issues, not copyright infringement.  I realise that hidden
directories in an incoming dir is a security issue, but it seems to be a
thinly veiled attack on the distribution of software of illegal or
questionable origins.  They do publish security advisories; i would be
interested in seeing a list of sites served with notices similar to those
julf and soda received. Does anyone have more info on CERT? 

BTW-  SEI at CMU is a scary place.  The photo lab i worked for as a
messenger had clients there, so i was in the building a couple times a day
for more than i year.  Because of their DOD affiliation, there are regular
protests outside the building.  On a normal delivery during one of these
protests i was surrounded by guards, searched, and asked some WAY paranoid
questions even though the regular guards knew who i was.  If you ever
happen to be walking the halls of SEI and see the nice big prints of
guided missiles and other scary stuff,  I probably delivered them.
