>Dear cert et al,
>
>It has come to my notice recently that your organisation has been 
>involved in a number of accusations against individuals and organisations
>with very little to back such accusations. 
>
>I am referring to, and these are the ones I will mention here, the 
>soda.berkeley.edu and the anon.penet.fi sites., both of which ARE
>legitamate in all respects and are SEEN as such by the net.community.
>Your organisations actions, in my personal opinion, consititute a form
>of harrassment of the worse kind, and it basically smells.
>
>Whilst any one with any knowledge of your workings already knows the
>low quality of feedback, lack of helpfulness and general arrogance of
>your methods, it doesnt do you any good at all to set about on a 
>crusade of self-serving actions against those sites or entities or
>groups of individuals you dont like or you see as furthering ideas
>and software that might one day make your life difficult. You will
>alienate a larger proportion of the net.community than you otherwise
>have.
>
>I would suggest in future you take the time to VERIFY, through whatever
>legal means are at your disposal, the authenticity of your information,
>to view yourselves the problems/files and then take whatever action your
>charter states as appropriate. Going off gun-ho and sending ominous form
>letters to people you see as gullible enough to carry out your desires
>really is less than professional.
>
>I fail to see where you get authority for a large proportion of your
>actions, but that is a matter between you and your financiers. Just dont
>expect people to take you seriously if the above scenarios are repeated.
>
>The above is my own personal observations and not those of any other
>individual or organisation, although they are free to explicitly echo
>them if they so desire. As of yet, none have.
