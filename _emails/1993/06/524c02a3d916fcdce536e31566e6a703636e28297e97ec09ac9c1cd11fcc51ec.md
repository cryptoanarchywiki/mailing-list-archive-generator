			Abstract

In this thesis, I describe extensions to the Kerberos Authentication
System to enable a secure method of Authentication over multiple
networks.  Kerberos was designed with a fully-connected IP network in
mind, however when you add dialup capabilities to the picture,
Kerberos doesn't expand to secure the whole connection.

Charon was created to tackle this problem.  It was developed to
provide a way to securely authenticate to a login server over a modem
connection, without allowing a passive attacker to gain enough
information to impersonate the user.  This means that a user can log
into a Kerberized host without typing his password in clear-text over
the phone.  In addition, no modifications to the login server's base
operating system need to be made in order to accomplish this.
