Hay all!  I'm becomming very intrigued about digital cash.  But, I have a few
qestions.  
 
1. How does one start a digital cash economy?  How is the initial distribution
of currency done?  This is, of course, assuming the technical stuff is taken
care of.
 
2. Is digital cash supposed to be backed by actuall cash on deposit at the bank?
 
3. How would one "get out" of such an economy if he wanted to?
 
4. If DC is to be backed by actual cash, is this really such a good idea?
 
Looking forward to hearing any and all comments.
