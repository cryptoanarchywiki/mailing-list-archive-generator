A while ago Dave Sun suggested keeping a file containing the public
keys of the remailers in an easy to get format.  (I'm embarrased how
long it has taken me to do this!)  I recently upload the keys I have,
signed by myself and occasionally others.  I recently uploaded a
tar-gzip file with the public keys I have, and an MSDOS zip file of
the same info will follow shortly.

I'd like to (at least) get the remailer operators to sign their keys.
I must apologize in advance because once I went through my key ring
and removed all the "unknown signator" signatures, and thus have
probably erased the signatures that some put on in the first place.
If this is the case, please send me the remailer keys, your public
key, and I'll add them both to my ring so I won't have those errors in
the future!
