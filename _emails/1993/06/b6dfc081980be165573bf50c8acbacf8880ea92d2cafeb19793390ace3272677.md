very similar circumstances resulted in penet shutting down for a
lengthy period; penet is still operating under severe restrictions.
the cert letter could have produced the same result.

interestingly, i believe the penet letter was sent to the same address
as the earlier, infamous "famous net personality" letter.

another coincidence?
