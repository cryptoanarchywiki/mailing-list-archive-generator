In re: tested telexes

	for those who don't know, telexes have been made 'secure' by use of a
	simple testing system for, say, banks to 'wire' money with.  This
	extant paradigm gives me hope that electronic contracts are coming.

In re: Wilde, ptui

	Pascal, SCHMASCAL.  "Schlup.. schlup schlup."  -WSB

In re: govmnt nastiness
	
	Well, gee, I thought Carter was a pig, too.  Lookit East Timor.  But as
	Slick Willie goes, I dunno.  I believe propagation of technology may
	outflank any intentions he may have.  Maybe.

be cool,
