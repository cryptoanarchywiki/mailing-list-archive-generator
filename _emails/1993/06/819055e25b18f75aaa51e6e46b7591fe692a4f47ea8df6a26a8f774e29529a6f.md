Naturally they'll open a file on you to document the fact that you requested
information under the FOIA and to file a copy of the information returned
to you.

Will they start an investigation on the basis of the fact that you
requested information under the FOIA?  How many people with rather, shall
we say, unusual ideas do you think have pestered the CIA or NSA with
FOIA requests?

Of course, if you admit you learned about this on a cryptoanarchist
e-mail list... :-)
