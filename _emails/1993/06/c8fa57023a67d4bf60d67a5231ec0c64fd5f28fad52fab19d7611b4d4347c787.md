This is speaker recognition, not voice recognition.  It turns out that
the problem is solved in a very different way for each; voice 
recognition, in order to be speaker independent, must throw out
the information that makes it possible to do speaker recognition
(and vice versa: the latter does not need some of the information 
that the former needs).

This is used in "roving wiretaps" that apparently are used infrequently
as they scan whole exchanges or number sets (e.g., all payphones in 
some city).  The idea is to capture phone calls from the suspects that
are savvy enough to know that they are being tapped.  At least one
Mob boss was caught this way (in Los Angeles, I think, about 4-5
years ago).
