There are at least 7 versions of INT 14. Then there's 
Ungerman-Bass's old INT 6B as well as two flavors of its 
successor, NASI/NCSI. There are also many variants of COMx 
device drivers. These are all serial line abstractions for the 
PC. There are others.

FOSSIL may be popular on BBSs, but NASI/NCSI is number one in 
the market. The oldest version of INT 14 is number two.

Who was it said "The nice thing about standards is that there 
are so many to choose from"? :-)
