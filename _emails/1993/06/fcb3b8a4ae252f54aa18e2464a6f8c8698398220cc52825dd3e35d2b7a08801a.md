I'll take John up on his kind offer! 

Though I expressed that to me this experience was kind of funny (in a
devil-may-care way, I hope you all understand), it *does* raise larger
issues of whether CERT is developing list of what might be called
"subversives" based on hearsay evidence and innuendo.

So, I'll try to pursue this and keep you folks posted.
