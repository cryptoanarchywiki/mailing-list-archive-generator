A related topic to encrypted disk drives.  Anybody who has a desire to
see their data around long term makes backups of their drives.  At
least
one of these backups is usually physically near the drive in
question.

What good it is to have an encrypted disk if the backups are not also
encrypted?

Backups occur at the file system level, where an encrypted file system
does not appear encrypted, so that work here does not directly
leverage to encrypted backups.
