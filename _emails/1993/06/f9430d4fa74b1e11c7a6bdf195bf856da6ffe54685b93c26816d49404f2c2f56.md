That is, if a is a generator of G, or as close to one as possible.  

My thinking was obviously clowded...  Not that I have a beer in me, I remember
that for any element, a of group G, a will have order n, such that n|ord(G).
This implies that there are n different (positive) powers of a which yield a 
particular number, b in our case.  Each of which would qualify as a log.  I
think I understand.

Then which root are we to use in discussion?
