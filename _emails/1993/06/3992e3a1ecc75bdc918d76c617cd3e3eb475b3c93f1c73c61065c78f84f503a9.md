I believe this account of the use of the census is incorrect.  I don't
have documentation, but the version I know doesn't require anyone to
break any laws, and is just as invasive of privacy.  Given that, I
think it's a stronger argument against the census, but possibly a
weaker example for clipper.

As I've heard it, the Selective Service got lists from the Census of
how many people of Japanese descent lived in each census tract.  This
information is publicly available, and doesn't require anyone breaking
any laws or promises to the public.  The Census makes summaries of all
the information they collect available, usually at the level of census
tracts.  Armed with such a list, the SS could go door to door in any
neighborhood in which they hadn't yet found enough Japanese-Americans.

<begin short political flame>
I don't believe that people should respond to the census, given that
the information can be abused in this way, according to the strictest
interpretation of the assurances given to the public.  The only valid
purpose of the census is to count citizens and apportion congressional
districts.  Any other purpose makes it less likely that the original
purpose will be served well.
