Well thanks for the advice, but you fergot to mention why...

I would be very interested in a card like this, if anyone can find one.

Another possibility until then, and one that would be fun for people who
like to play with EPROMS, is a card that had a cable leading to an external
EPROM socket that you could lay on your desk or on top of the case or 
wherever.  You burn your keys for the HD into a chip and use it as a key,
physically inserting the chip in the socket each time.  There are lots 
on new ways to make chips easy to plug in and out, I'm sure it wouldn't 
be too hard.

I still don't see why all of the actual encryption couldn't be done in 
software though...
