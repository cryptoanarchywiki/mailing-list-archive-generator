Feh on Pournelle and Niven especially, dreary drones of the Ayn Rand school
of pseudo-insight.

Read some of Peter Drucker's new work on corporate responsibility and tell
me corporate America isn't thinking about ethics and morality.  

And just this weekend on a PBS forum on workplace harassment issues I heard
a CEO quoting Milton Friedman approvingly on the issue of ethical behavior
not only being the right thing to do but central to achieving the corporate
mission.

Wake up -- it's not 1880 any more!!
