The number of lines added seems to vary with the gating.  I'm sort of
leaning toward a

........8<....(cut here).....8<.......

kind of solution; I mean, I know for a fact where I stopped, so anything
beyond that ought to be eaten by the remailers, IMHO.  There is probably
a good argument against that solution, but I can't think of it offhand.
