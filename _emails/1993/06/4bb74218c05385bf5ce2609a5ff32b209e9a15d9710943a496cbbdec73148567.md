I repeat -- NIST had no choice, because PKP held all the patent cards.
Even if you don't believe PKP's claim to all of public-key cryptography,
both the Diffie-Hellman and Schnorr patents would most likely be infringed
by DSA.  You can argue with the specifics of the deal -- and with what
NIST gave away in order to get the Clipper exemption through -- but
they had to reach some settlement.

Btw -- the deal is *not* final; the announcement is just the start of
a 60-day comment period.
