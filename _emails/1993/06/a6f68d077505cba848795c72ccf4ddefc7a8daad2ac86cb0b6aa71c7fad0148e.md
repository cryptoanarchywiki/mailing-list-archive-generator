Ahh.. what a good day it was today!
I am currently logged in to my UNIX account
from home.  I am sitting here mailing you guys, and
everything I type is being sent over the modem
in encrypted form.
I worked out some very irritating bugs in
my software and have my link protocol up and
running pretty reliably.  It still needs some
cleaning up.

I will be cleaning it up a little and running
it on a few different platforms to test it out.
The code is basically the same as the unix end
I mailed out to several people earlier (with just
3 or 4 lines changed),  but I now have a good, 
functional VT100 end for my amiga.

I will post here after I clean up and test
the code a little and get it ready for "release".
So if you're interested, basically just wait.
But I am looking for people who are willing
to port to other platforms.  The common code
should need no porting, what needs to be done
really is to find a good P.D. term program in
source form and modify it (this is what I have
done).  The common code was written with this
in mind and it shouldnt be terribly hard
(simply replacing writes to screen and
serial with encoding/decoding routines and
then outputting the results,  and small things
like providing the user a way to turn on
and off the encryption).

                        Tim
