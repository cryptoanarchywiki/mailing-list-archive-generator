Stanton McCandlish <anton@hydra.unm.edu> recently quoted a rant of mine
directed at him.  I really thought directed it to him literally--that I 
mailed it to his address, not the list's.  

Stanton, I didn't mean to flame you in public.  I apologize.

This is the second time this has happened this week.  I'm starting to
think that when I created this "fnerd" mail account I accidentally 
created an alter ego--my evil twin who posts personal insults to
mailing lists...

I will try to be triply, not just doubly sure of what I'm doing and
put lots of warnings on any such personal grouch mail: "I DIDN'T
POST THIS; BETWEEN YOU AND ME; PLEASE DON'T QUOTE ME," etc.

in control now--SEIG HEIL!--down! down!...
--Steve Witham (aka fnerd)
quote me, this WAS posted
