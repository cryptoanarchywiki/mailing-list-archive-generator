The technique I advocated was so simple, I could code it on my lunch hour at 
work.  I did.  If you didn't want to have such a thing on your machine, you 
could store it remotely, either on an ftp site or a local bbs.  Clean up 
your hard disk and there is no sign of anything.

If steganography is to work, we must find ways to make this "principle" invalid.
Strong encryption will protect our "plain-sight-text."  It falls to Data-hiding
to protect our cyphertext.

I was going to suggest, but Phil beet me to it, that we compress our executables

Well, we could do a lot of things here.  We could have the option of xor'ing,
adding, or subtracting....  We could add random bytes to the cyphertext, at 
offsets we specify and memorize....  I still think this could be done, and that
it would work.  If anyone else shares my enthusiasm, I'll try to get it coded up
