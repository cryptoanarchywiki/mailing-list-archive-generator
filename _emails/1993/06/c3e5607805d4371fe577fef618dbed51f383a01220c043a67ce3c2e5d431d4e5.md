Granted.  However, as you say, they are terribly slow and inefficient
even at this.  While I read CERT adisories and clippings, it is rare
that I discover anything which could be called 'news.'

Perhaps, then, their name is inappropriate.  The term "Computer" seems
to imply they are involved with computers.  This is true.  However,
"Emergency," when modified by "Computer," seems to indicate that they
are involved in some way with "Computer Emergencies," whatever this
means.  When combined with "Response," the previous terms seem to imply
that they are intended to "Respond" to "Computer Emergencies," which,
as you say, they don't do.  They ought to change their name, or find
some computer emergencies to which to respond.

A quibble:  I believe you mean 'libellous.'  They are crypto-fascists;
that is to say, they are 'hidden' fascists.  (However, I'll grant that
calling them fascists is probably not productive, however amusing it
may be.)

I shall do so.  Don't worry, I won't call them crypto-fascists.  I
shall forward it when I send it.
