The 5/24/93 issue of "The New Republic" has a (largely uninteresting)
cover story about Mitch Kapor and the EFF. One interesting tidbit 
gleaned from that article, however, was that AT&T has contributed 
money to the EFF. I am particularly curious to see how AT&T and the EFF
will deal with each other with respect to the Clipper chip, and
the politics around that.

If anyone knows anything more about this, I'd love to hear it.
