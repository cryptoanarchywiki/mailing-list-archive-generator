The ftp site at soda will no longer be able to distribute PGP, I'm
afraid.  It appears that CERT informed someone on campus that
"pirated" software was available on soda.  The word came down, and the
directory has been chown'd root and has had permissions removed.

There will be more later on this.  In the meantime, spread the word.

Eric
