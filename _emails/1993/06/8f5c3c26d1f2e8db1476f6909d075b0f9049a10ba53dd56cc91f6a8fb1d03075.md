bout all the Bizdos flap:

It is entirely possible that PKP has no sensible alternative
but to capitulate to the NSA's offer.  While Bizdos himself may
oppose the Clipper chip, it is obviously in PKP's best interest
to accept a virtual monopoly on the crypto industry.  

While Bizdos' title may be "President," it is very easy for a
company to remove a "President" who makes unprofitable choices.
As has been said before, corporations have no truck with ethics.
To expect a corporate entity to behave ethically is the same as
to expect a T-cell to cease absorbing phagocytes.  It ain't in
its nature.

If one wishes PKP to behave "ethically," it is necessary for us
to make it unprofitable for PKP to behave in the manner in which
it is.  E. g. question their patents, bring suits against them,
and otherwise make PKP's existence unprofitable.  Suddenly, it 
will behave "ethically."

Any ideas, folks?  

Don't expect help from Bizdos on it, though.

[P. S. Ever notice that the only two people who have
automatic form-letter answers to their email are Billys?
Billy Idol and Billy Clinton.  Fitting, somehow.]
