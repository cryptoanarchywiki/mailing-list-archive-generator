This look suspiciously like a form letter.  The possible plurals
("(s)") and the fact that the site name is in a "list type" format
indicate this is probably a form letter.  This is even more
disturbing; do they have a form letter because they use it often or
do they have a daemon that searches for highly undesirable things
such as ftp sites with lots of encryption related things and
automatically fires off this harassing form letter?
