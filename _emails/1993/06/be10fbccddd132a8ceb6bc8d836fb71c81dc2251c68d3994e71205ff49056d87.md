Hmm, 10 bucks says some larrikin sends fakemail from PRESIDENT to
VICE.PRESIDENT asking him 'what this little red button does' etc.
Though in real.life I suspect 10 press secretaries sitting behind
the mail alias. They're going to need them.

Lets hope no one is stupid enough to try busting into there...
