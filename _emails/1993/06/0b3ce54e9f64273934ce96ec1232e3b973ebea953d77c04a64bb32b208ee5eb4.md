In order to equalize, what may be construed as a growing disparity between
ripem and pgp availability (i.e. ripem binaries being kept online for ftp).
I have taken upon myself to start collecting binaries for PGP. If you would
be kind enough to email me if you would like to offer any binaries. I will
check against what I already have and get back to you for retrieval. Please
enclose your OS and sytem type (pretty much referring to UNIX here).

For instance,
-r--r--r--   1 ftp      guest     252829 Jun 17 05:05 pgp-hp720-8.07.Z
-r--r--r--   1 ftp      guest     166958 Jun 17 05:00 pgp-ibm-rs6000-3.1.Z
