and what do you make of their report on julf's non-existent
ftp area?

steve, you know me well; you know i'm not a raving lunatic or
or a conspiracy-freak nut-case.  but i believe it is more
than a coincidence that soda and penet were suddenly tarred by
the same brush.

perhaps cert is being used as a weapon, as marc suggested.  that
is the most benign interpretation i can think of.  so i ask you
again:  don't you think cert might be jeopardizing its effectiveness
through these actions?
