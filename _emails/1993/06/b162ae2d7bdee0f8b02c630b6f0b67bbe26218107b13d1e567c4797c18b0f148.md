It appears that they are going to count responses and make totals pro
and con any particular issue that people write about.  Thus while the
particulars of the petition don't really matter, the basic statements
against restrictions on encryption technology do.

I also heard no mention that they were going to do any kind of sorting
by person or email address.  Thus it appears that you get to vote
early and often in this public opinion poll.

Heh, heh, heh.
