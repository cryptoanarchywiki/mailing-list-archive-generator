Norton might let interested people exhamine the code, far as I know
nobody has asked, but one mode is DES.  It seems to me if Norton
were ok, you could encrypt with Norton and decrypt with any other
hardware/software implimention of DES.  Unless Norton does something
really dumb like stashing the key on disk somewhere, it would seem
to me that this would varify Norton doing DES per the book.  Have
I missed something?  Keith
