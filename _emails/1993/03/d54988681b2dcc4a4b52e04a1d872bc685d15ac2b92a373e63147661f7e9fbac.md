To do this for free, no.  But you can send direct mail anonymously,
although you can't get cheap bulk rates.

True.  Perhaps we should look at the problems of universal anonymity
in contexts where they can already be observed -- like cellulose
mail.  

It would be possible to implement a "postage" analog without a backed
crypto currency.  Each remailer could issue usage tickets, good for
a certain flow per month.  Issue them to individuals, and let them
circulate.  There are obvious problems; for one, transactions would
be on a good-will basis, except in the case of trades to consolidate
a block with a single remailer.  This would produce allocation
problems.  In this mileau, a net.loser might be able to panhandle a
truckload of tickets.  On the up side, it's a good cover for getting
currency up and running.

With real postage, I think the problem would be negligible.  I can
imagine a custom developing that mail from nyms not on the "pass"
list would have to include a certain fee just to make into the
mailbox.  A motivation pre-filter for just mail, at least.  If mail
transmission is flat-fee, such a system seems quite likely.
