Well, I didn't read it completely, but printed it instead, thinking it might
be juicy.  Can you say Gotcha? ;^)

No it is not.  I assume that the TLA's read EVERYTHING I post.  How's that
for paranoia?

Good point, but please read my closing comments.

Perhapse by a TLA?

Once anonymous remailers become widely used, they will become "powerfull."  When
they become "too" powerfull, they will be under attack.  The eventual goal being
to shut them down on an individual basis.  I don't see them being attacked as a
whole.  The attack will be to simply shut them down.  Well, perhapse an attack
might be to discredit them...as a whole, but I digress.

What we need is a protocol that would notify the rest of the net/world when a
remailer is shut down.  What if the bbs in opperation Sundevil was expected to
send a message every day to other sites around the world.  When the bbs was
shut down, that message wouldn't be sent and every one would know what 
happened?  I don't have time to go on, but does anyone have any comments?
