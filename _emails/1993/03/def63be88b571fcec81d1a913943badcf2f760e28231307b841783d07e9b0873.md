Well, "the" account has "my" name stamped all over it.  With a few
resstrictions... I have full use of the account.  But that's not
proof.  Here's proof... quoting from UB's own computing policy ...
(which I am now THOUROULY familiar with!  :->  )

...


Even the policy seems to agree that someone is an "owner" of a given
account.  It doesn't mention that ACS (Academic Computing Services) is
the "owner" of the account.  Need I say more?
