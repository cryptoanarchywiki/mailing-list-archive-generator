my office mate and I were talking along simular lines, but for DOS. we
were thinking of setting up disk/partition encryption software that works
like the product "stacker" or  "double disk". but instead of just compressing
we encrypt.    When the system boots it will ask for a password phrase, it
you do not provide on the disk will not me accessable  (it will just appear
to be a unformated partition).   

Thus when you are raided and they power down your system, they will loose
access to the date.
