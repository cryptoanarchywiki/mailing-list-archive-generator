## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}From: babani@cs.Buffalo.EDU (Rusty Babani)
Date: Wed, 3 Mar 93 13:04:40 PST
To: cypherpunks@toad.com
Subject: ANON: My remailer
Message-ID: <9303032103.AA26981@armstrong.cs.Buffalo.EDU>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


Due to circumstances beyond my control, I have had to take down the
remailer that is running in my account.  (read: If I put it back up
again... my account will be taken away.)

I only got a brief message from the system administrator stating
"Running anonymous remailers is against University policy."

Thus, since my account is more important (considering I need it for 
projects and the like...) than a remailer, I have taken it down.

I'd appreciate it if you spread the word.
