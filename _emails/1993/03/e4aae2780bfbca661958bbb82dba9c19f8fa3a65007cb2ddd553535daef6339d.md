Why is there a presumption that any such authenticated news software
would be used without license?  RSADSI is not trying to sit on their
patents, but to make money from them.

What you believe to be real and what I believe to be real may be
different.  To claim that another is being unrealistic is to mask
what is foremost a difference in belief.

What assumptions here do you disagree with?  If you are explicit,
perhaps we can forge an agreement.
