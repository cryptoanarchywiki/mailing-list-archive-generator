[ a bunch of bickering deleted concerning who was wrong to have lost their

 temper first.  ]

Folks, this is the cypherpunks list.  I have three observations to make.

1.  Joining it is voluntary.
2.  It generates a tremendous amount of traffic.
3.  Many people on it can write filters and such.  It's a technical list.

Why do I mention three obvious points?  Here's my personal situation.  I 
suspect it is similar to many here.  I read many mail lists.  The traffic
on them is large, and the unsubscribe messages are numerous.  Being a
pro-code kind of person, rather than complain frequently about people being
stupid with unsubscribe requests, I filtered 'em.  So, I've never seen the
unsubscribe requests.  Anything with unsubscribe in the subject gets filtered.
I've never seen any of you complain about a problem with the list.  Suddenly,
some genius craps in my mail file.  My problem was with said genius, so I
replied to him.  End of problem, right?  Wrong.  Someone with a chip on his
shoulder makes a federal case about it and starts name calling.  It's
really ironic that Tim May gets blasted as a petty vandal for mailing
George back a third of George's post.

I'm not in any position to be able to help with a problem with the subscription
list.  When it comes down to a choice between writing a quick filter to make
sure I don't see mail that irritates me or complaining, I write a filter.  When
it comes down to passively accepting "punishment" from someone who voluntarily
joined the list, wants to quit the list due to traffic, and then hypocritically
worsens the situation by doubling the traffic for a day singlehandedly, I
refuse.  If this list was for beginning computer users and children, I'd be 
much more patient.  

I didn't want George's mail, so I gave it back to him.
