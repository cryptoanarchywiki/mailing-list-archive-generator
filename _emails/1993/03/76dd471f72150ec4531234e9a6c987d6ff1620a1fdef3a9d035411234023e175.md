Not really.  Since its foundation, the cornerstone of government is that it
maintains the only legitimate monopoly on the use of violence.  Like it or
not, this is how it works and most of the sheep/citizens are quite happy to
maintain this system.  It is kind of ironic that you would propose to ban
the advocacy of government on the nets considering the fact that without
governement the nets would not be here in the first place.  Sounds
inconsistent to me...
