Well, of course one doesn't have to break RSA to get the _session_ key,
it would be enough to break IDEA, which will automatically deliver
the key to you along with the cleartext. Again of course, it's
not obvious, why one might want that session key (:-).

Sure... How about one, who simply knows how to improve
brute-force key-search attack on IDEA?  A possibility? (:-)
