I'm all for exploring hiding messages in the LSBs of images and audio
(having written on this since 1988, and several times on this list), but I
don't understand the idea of putting messages in widely distributed,
publicly-advertised commercial or semi-commercial CDs:

- if lots of people know about it--presumably the goal here--then why hide
the message? (Granted, it'll make some people say "Like, wow! Like,
messages, man!"...or whatever the current vernacular version would be.)

- how would the key be distributed as widely? 

- clearly this is not a practical way to steganographically send messages. 


So, what exactly is the point of this exercise?
