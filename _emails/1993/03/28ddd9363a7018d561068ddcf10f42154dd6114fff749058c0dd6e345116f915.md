Sir,

I find the contents of your warning message (appended below) to be an
outrageous affront to the right of Freedom of Speech granted to all Americans
in the Constitution. In fact, if you take a moment to think globally, your
proposals are detrimental to the future freedom of all Citizens of the World.
I think that you *yourself* should be warned that there are many of us
watching your actions with great interest - and some of us have very long
memories when such repressive actions are considered. particularly vexing is
the idea that ANY anonymous mail might be censored - this might edit out
EXACTLY the voices of criticism that make out Nation and our Internet great.
Any newsgroup that can't accept the fundamental right anonymous posting
should have the option of IGNORING them, but not  removing them. People who
want to censor speech in such a knee-jerk way have no place in public with
other free people.

If the reasoned opinion of any upstanding Citizen of the Internet or the US
has any effect on your actions, I strongly urge you to stop this practice (if
you have begun using it) and to never, ever begin it (if you have not yet).

Someday you may want to vote in a US election. You'll probably want to cast a
secret ballot, won't you? This is only one small example of the fundamental
role of anonymity in our great Democracy. We don't need this brand of
"enforcement" example on the Internet, and we don't need berobed Ku Klux Klan
members lynching people to remind minorities to "behave." Erode these
freedoms, and you may one day be unable to cast a ballot without being
photographed and fingerprinted - it wouldn't be a very satisfactory way to
run a Democracy, would it? You might scoff at my example, but one can build a
mountain from many pebbles, and your action is a large chunk of stone in the
mountain of Thought Bondage.

I prefer to believe that you are a well-educated, thoughtful person who can
see the Orwellian Thought Control inherent in this idea. i refer to imagine
that you will not only reconsider such actions and vow to never follow those
censorial urges, but also actively persuade others of such restrictive
opinions to reconsider and stop their actions. A good Golden Rule to follow
is: "Don't limit anyone's Freedom of Speech or you might be next one to be
silenced!"

Do the Right Thing!
