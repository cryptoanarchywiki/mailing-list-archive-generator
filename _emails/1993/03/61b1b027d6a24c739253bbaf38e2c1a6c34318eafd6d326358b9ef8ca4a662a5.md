Besides, Michael Jackson sucks! ;^)

I assume you mean with their permission.  Think of it, you tell a band that you want to distribute one of their demo's around the world.  I think they'd buy it.
And I don't think they'd care that you embedded a message in it, either.  And a
lot of cypherpunks like underground music.  Works for all of us.  I like this 
idea and think it could work.

I love it! Pretty Good Productions...  That's the best. ;^)

I don't know, will a modem weed out all of the noise to get to the carrier
tones that we embedded in the crap...er...I mean rap music. ;^)

I wonder if a PC will read the data that comprises a CD data-set.  My
consern is about directory structure etc.

Kind of a new twist on backward subliminal messages, eh? ;^)

We could distribute the needed source code on an underground basis.
We could distribute whole software packages piggy-backing on a garage 
band's demo!  Bitchen!

Most definately!
