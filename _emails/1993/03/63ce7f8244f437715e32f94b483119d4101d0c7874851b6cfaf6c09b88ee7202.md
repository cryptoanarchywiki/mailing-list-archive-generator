*grumblegrumble*  Are these MIME headers, or what? I'll have to hack this
citer to handle them.

Jim> nic.funet.fi:pub/msdos/incoming
The files on this one were zero-length nulls at the time of my checking.

Jim> garbo.uwasa.fi:pc/incoming
The directory was empty, and the files weren't elsewhere on the system
to an admitedly cursory scan.
Jim> src.doc.ic.ac.uk:tmp/pgp

Jim> I snagged mine from src.doc.ic.ac.uk, so I know it is at least at that
Jim> site...

And that was where I got mine, the only site I was able to actually find
them.
