   ted, i think that with just a little of the right technical stuff, it is
   very easy to establish a nym in today's nets.  e.g., if you buy a cheap
   unix box, it comes with uucp, so you can hook up to one of many anonymous
   uucp sites.

   that's easy.

Buying a unix box and finding a UUCP connection is still a lot more
effort than getting a new anonymous remailer pseudomnym.  It certainly
costs a lot more money!  And if you continuously mailbomb someone, the
victim still has the (somewhat tenuous) recourse of asking the upstream
uucp site to cut off the miscreant.

There are controls to reduce how much someone can abuse the network.

   i know of several slip/ppp endpoints that aren't password protected.  more
   every day, in fact.

   that's easy.

And if those endpoints were abused, the owners of said endpoints would
probably clamp down and protect them.  (If they're used too much, they'd
probably clamp down anyway, since presumably they didn't pay good money
for those resources to give them away free to anyone who can dail up to
them.)

There are controls to reduce how much someone can abuse the network.

You seem to be proposing that all such controls be removed.
