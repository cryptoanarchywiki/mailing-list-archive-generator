What arrogant little pricks you are, Mr. Ringuette and Mr. May! So is this
what cypherpunks is really all about: "dirty tricks", "mail bombs", endless
harassment of people on the net who simply wish to be left alone? I had
originally thought that cypherpunks had higher objectives in mind than
that, but evidently at least some of you simply fancy yourselves as some
sort of cyber-terrorists (although you're really no better than petty
vandals).

I've seen many of you raise issues about responsibility on the net. Is
proving that you have a "bigger arsenal of dirty tricks" you're idea of
responsibility? And do you really think that cypherpunks could survive such
a war? You yourselves have admitted that you have many enemies in your
quest for net privacy and anonymity. Do you foolishly believe that they
won't seize upon this irresponsible behavior on your part and use it to
prove their point? You will only succeed in bringing about precisely what
you claim to oppose: oppressive controls on the internet to stop petty
vandals like yourself.

I would hope that there are some among you that have some scrap of sanity
left, and realize that there is nothing to be gained from bringing a
needless war down upon yourselves. Wise up!

From tcmay:
>I don't know what the delay has been in unsubscribing people. As always,
>send requests to the list maintenance address,
>"cypherpunks-request@toad.com". The list manager, Eric Hughes
>(hughes@soda.berkelely.edu), has been away at the CFP conference this
>week...perhaps this is part of the delay.

I sent one request to cypherpunks-request about three weeks ago, and a
second about a week ago. Was Eric Hughes at the CFP conference then? And
you may have noticed that a third person has now stepped forward and
expressed frustration over being in the same predicament. Do you still want
to pretend there is no problem? What will it take for you to realize there
is: the third person, the fourth, fixth, sixth? I'll say it again: Wise up!


I've been very patient over this, but I'm disgusted at your arrogant
promises of "dirty tricks" and "mail bombs" against those who simply want
to unsubscribe from the list! What phenomenal assholes you are!!!
