Granted, a DAT can carry more data in the LSBs--about 80 MB, about the
length of 10 Bibles--than one really needs.

The GIF option I mentioned allows a widely disseminated image file to
contain about 32 KB in just the LSBs of a 512 x 512 x 8-bit gray scale
image. A color image could easily hold three times more (LSBs in each color
channel). And some GIFs are much larger than 512 on a side.

So, a fairly long message could be inserted into the "noise floor" bits of
a scanned or frame-grabbed image, or of a piece of "original art" and then
posted worldwide in one of the GIF groups. Who knows what evil messages are
even now being sent in GIFs of Cindy Crawford and Claudia Schiffer?

Use your imagination and you'll see there are several other easy ways to
hide messages. (Again, we're talking steganography--check the "Glossary" in
the soda.berkeley.edu archives if this is new to you.)
