A very good point. I was thinking more about the "ARMM"-style attacks and
not so much about the normal filters people might write to keep from seeing
anonymous posts.

So, anything we do to make it hard for a determined attacker (writing
ARMM-style filters), makes it even harder for casual users.

I guess the solution is to discourage global, ARMM-style filters (and
perhaps even look again, as a community, at digital sigs for postings, so
that only the author can cancel them).
