Hi.

I am going to be in the San Diego area for the weekend of March 20th.
I don't know where I'm going to be staying, and I don't know the San
Diego area at all.  (I do know that I will be near the beach ;-)

However I'd like to meet people, if they have time to get together.
If you have time and want to meet some time that weekend, please send
me a piece of mail and let me know.

OBTW -- what are the good 2m and 70cm repeaters out there?  ;-)
