	non-interest-paying checking accounts - remember those, from
	long ago ? :-) You could probably legally run a bank that
	didn't require SSNs for these, though most banks don't.

Banks need your SSN (at least) for being able to report to the IRS
anything they are required to report.  This can include interest
payments, but also includes things like making cash transactions of
more than $10k.  Bank accounts *must* be fully documented in this
country.  Switzerland, and certain small islands have more lax rules.

The USA does not.

Privacy is one thing.  Money is another, at least in this country.
