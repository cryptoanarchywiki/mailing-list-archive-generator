I'll keep this one very short.

* To handle _abusive volumes_ through remailers, charge for remailing.
Short term, this may be a problem, but this is the long term market
solution.

* To handle _abusive messages_ through remailers, ignore them. "Sticks and
stones" and all that. Put positive reputation filters in place. Accept
e-mail only through those you know or have reason to trust.

As Sandy Sandfort so cogently put it, punish the perps, not the words of
the perps. This is the basis of our society, and a good basis, too.
