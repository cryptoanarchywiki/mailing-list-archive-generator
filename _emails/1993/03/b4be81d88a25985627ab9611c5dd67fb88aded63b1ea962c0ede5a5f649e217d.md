No, Steve, you're NOT crazy and YES this was a completely unintentional
thing. I did nothing out of the ordinary - I only addressed my mail to the
list (as usual).

Furthermore, my subject field was replaced with "Unknown subject" - which was
expressly NOT the subject of my original posting.

Who's tinkering? ...Please STOP. I don't want my mail or anyone else's to
trigger any more of these listings. I'm wondering out loud if this anomaly
could indicate some subrosa official investigation of our list - perhaps
someone Not Silly at All has been in to take a look and needs these lists of
members?  Hmmmm.
