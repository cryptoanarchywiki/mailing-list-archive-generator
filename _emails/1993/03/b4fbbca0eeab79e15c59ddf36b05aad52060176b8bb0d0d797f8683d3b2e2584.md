I think that's certainly a viable idea. Of course, the Sender: field
is more honored in the breach than the observance by many mailers.
Another thing to remember is "Errors-To:" which can save a lot of
grief when handling bounces.

It would warm my heart to see questions like this come up at IETF
meetings. Keep up the good work.
