I agree with your disagreement but disagree with your conclusion (huh?).

IMHO a remailer operator should *NEVER* reveal any identities, but I
also believe very strongly that especially if you provide a way to post
news articles, there has to be a way to send replies to the original
sender. Thus a remailer must maintain mapping info.
