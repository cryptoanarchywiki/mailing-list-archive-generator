Mess-DOS struck again. My PGP directory got scrunged, so any servers and
individuals who may have added my PGP public key that I posted last month
have it wrong. My error.

Sorry about that. My *new* key, which can be easily identified as the
proper one by noting that my moribund psilink account is not on it, is
available via fingering me ajay@holonet.net.

Listfolks please note and remove my old key. Again, sorry.
