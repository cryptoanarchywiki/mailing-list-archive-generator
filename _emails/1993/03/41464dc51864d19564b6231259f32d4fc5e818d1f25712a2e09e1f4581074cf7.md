It's not an assumption, to begin with; I was not born an "anarchist".
Nor is it a philosophical belief, in my case; it's a sociological
conclusion.  And I only claim that it's what I want, not that it's
"good" for you -- that depends, for example, on whether you couldn't
be happy except as an IRS employee.  I'm not quite sure what you
intend by your later comments on "religious fanatics", but any
clarification or random flamage would best be done off-list.
