	 Perhaps there are people who believe Free Speech should be so much of an
	 absolute that you should be allowed to scream at the top of their lungs
	 at 5am in the morning in a residential area, and that libel and slander
	 laws shouldn't exist.  But it's not fair to call that a mainstream

I would like to separate the issues of hollering anything at 4am in
residential areas from things like libel and slander.  Disturbing
people with your volume independent of its content is like blasting
white noise at damaging volume levels.  The remedies for it have
nothing to do with speech, they have to do with disturbing the peace;
your sound is crossing onto my property at intolerable levels.
