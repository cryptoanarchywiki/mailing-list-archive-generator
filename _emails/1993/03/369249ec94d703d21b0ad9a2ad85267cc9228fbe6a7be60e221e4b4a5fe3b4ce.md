a) This method has essentially the same complexity, as one-time pad,
   but without it's strength.

b) If it's played and recognized - one can trace your source (a CD, a
   tape of radio broadcast, whatever) and do a comparison. Then the
   file containing of all the LSBs is cryptanalyzed...

I might be wrong IF those nice LSBs are too hard to track... But then
again, you're facing the need to communicate that one-time pad...

Oh yes, and I'm sure LOTS of people would join! (:-)
