The problem I found was that the file was not only compressed with the
2.04? PKZip, but that the -d option had been invoked to preserve a very
silly \DOC subdirectory for the documentation.  The result was that
PGP22.ZIP could not be unZIPped with _either_ version's simple PKUNZIP
command, but required the 2.04 version with the -d switch in the command
line.
   I finally got the file unZIPped, but rezipped it as a simple .ZIPfile
- without the ridiculous subdirectory - with v 1.10, which will unpack
with either version.  It's this package that I'm passing along.
   Hope this helps.
