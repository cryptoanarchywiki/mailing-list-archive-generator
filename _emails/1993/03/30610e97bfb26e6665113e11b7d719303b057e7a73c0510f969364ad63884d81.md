   I am grateful to both people who sent me the mail I lost;
I don't think I have a right to disclose their identity  ;-)
but I am grateful to them anyway, as well as to all those who
might want to send it to me later - please don't - too bad I'll
never know your names... Thanks anyway!

BTW, I missed the point when people started using prefixes in message
titles; was there an 'official' suggestion for it?

Alex.
