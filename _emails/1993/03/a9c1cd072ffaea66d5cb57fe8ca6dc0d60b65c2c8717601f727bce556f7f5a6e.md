Yeah, I was thinking around 5 bits per character, and you have to  
pattern-match something.  Could be "an-" or "x" or whatever...

Seems about right to me.  If there's demand for a different mix, you  
can always add that later (with a different prefix to clue the  
software into how to interpret).  Meanwhile this version could be  
implemented quickly, and would offer a good deal of security.  As to  
what to use for the salt... If you don't expect users to send more  
than one message per second (at least, if they do, they won't mind  
both of them having the same return address) you can just use a  
straight timestamp -- Unix gives you 32 bits worth for free (as sec.  
since 1 Jan 1970).  This guarantees you won't have loops from a PRNG.   
The time won't ever be reset to a past value.

I don't really think we need to do any encryption of the ID to  
address database, since only the remailer software should be using  
it.  And while adding more salt bits might be nice (random bits  
increase strength against known plaintext attacks -- a danger since  
you know the approximate time, and that your ID will be the same in  
each message you send), I don't see how hashing could be useful,  
since it is one-way by definition.  The remailer needs to both create  
and resolve return addresses.

Is the source for the anon.penet.fi remailer available?  I might have  
a crack at implementing this...

Joe
