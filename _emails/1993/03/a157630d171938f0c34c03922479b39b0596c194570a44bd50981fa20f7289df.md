Insert pgp-encrypted (not plaintext) into the sound file...  It's then
no weaker that pgp.

Use a "windows sound system" board and record yourself talking --
No "reference source"... The codec on that board has better than 
two bits of noise per 16 bit word through the ADC channel...

Nice idea, thug!
