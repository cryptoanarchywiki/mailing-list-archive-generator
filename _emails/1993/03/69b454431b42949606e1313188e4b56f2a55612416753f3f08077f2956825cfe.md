> 1.  Introduction
> 
>     The Defense Message System (DMS) Program has adopted Message Security
> Protocol (MSP) as the target security protection mechanism for all DMS
> organizational and individual message traffic.  MSP was developed under the
> auspices of the Secure Data Network System (SDNS) Program concurrent with
> international development of the CCITT X.400 1988 Recommendation.  SDNS MSP
> and 1988 X.400 offer a similar set of security services.  However, the two
> approaches diverge in certain areas, due to differing priorities and
> requirements, and the operational environment of the U.S. Department of
> Defense (DoD).  The purpose of this paper is to define the principal points of
> departure, provide rationale for U.S. use of MSP, and to provide a framework
> for agreement on near term messaging interoperability.
> 
> 2.  Rationale for Use of MSP
> 
>     While the security services provided by MSP are similar to the 1988 X.400
> Recommendation, the divergence in their implementation introduces
> incompatibilities between the two strategies.  Following is U.S. rationale for
> use of MSP.
> 
>     2.1  High Level of Assurance:  DMS provides secure automated store-and-
> forward message service to meet the operational requirements of the U.S. DoD.
> The DMS conveys information ranging from unclassified to the most sensitive
> classifications and compartments, requiring very high levels of assurance
> throughout the system.  While few, if any, individual User Agents (UAs) will
> handle this entire range, many will handle more than one, and therefore
> require a high degree of trust.  MSP provides high assurance in the areas of
> implementation strategy, access control, content security, and use of
> commercially available products and services.
> 
>       2.1.1  Implementation Strategy.  To achieve a high level of assurance,
> MSP was designed to provide separation of message security from message
> processing, and to facilitate a certifiable and accreditable implementation.
> By implementing the MSP security services in a separate protocol sub-layer, a
> multi-level secure (MLS) architecture can follow conventional approaches in
> the design of certifiable systems.  The MSP approach depends upon creating a
> small nucleus of "trusted" software, implemented as an adjunct to the UA, that
> interacts with multiple, single-level instantiations of more complex software,
> e.g., text editors and communications protocols.  Further, placing the
> security services at the end system (originator/recipient) is consistent with
> the principle of "least privilege", which requires security processes in a
> system to grant only the most restrictive set of privileges necessary to
> perform authorized tasks.

> 
>       2.1.2  Access Control.  The approach to access control adopted by MSP
> places access control decisions in a separate process within the originator
> and recipient UAs, providing a higher level of assurance for this service.
> This high level of assurance is supported by detailed security design analyses
> performed on various MSP prototype implementations.
> 
>         2.1.2.1  MSP access control decisions are made as part of message
> preparation and release, and as part of the processing of a received message.
> End system (UA) responsibility for access control is a cornerstone of the MSP
> security architecture.  The access control decision relies on authorization
> information contained in multiple certificates.  These certificates provide
> extended resolution for access control decisions and are further protected by
> cryptography at the UA.  Consequently, no access control message security
> requirements are levied on the Message Transfer Agents (MTAs).
> 
>         2.1.2.2  In contrast, 1988 X.400 access control decisions and
> enforcement are vested in the Message Transfer System (MTS) and are exercised
> independently by the MTAs at each end of the message transfer.  This requires
> that every subscriber uniformly trust all of the MTAs to enforce access
> control for the subscriber community.  A message originator has no independent
> means of determining the access rights of a possible recipient, nor the means
> to determine the level of trust of the MTAs that make access control
> decisions.  He must rely on the correct operation of the MTAs.
> 
>       2.1.3  Content Security.  MSP provides content security and integrity
> services with the implementation of independent cryptographic algorithms and
> key management system at the UA.  Encapsulation of message content with
> appropriate security parameters (e.g., algorithm identification and signature
> information) into a MSP content prior to submitting it to the MTS, ensures
> writer-to-reader control for all security services.  This is true regardless
> of the message transfer system employed.  Since only the originator and
> recipient may access the information, content security is preserved, and the
> means for message confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-
> repudiation with proof of origin is maintained.
> 
>       2.1.4  Commercial Products/Services.  A primary objective of the DMS
> Program is to employ commercially available products and services wherever
> possible, to minimize or eliminate the need for specialized systems.  It is
> also assumed that such products and services will undoubtedly be "untrusted"
> from the security perspective.  The use of MSP allows the DMS to deploy over
> any reliable and heterogeneous MTS and still provide the same level of message
> security and system assurance.  The MSP design and implementation strategy,
> coupled with the incorporated access control and content security mechanisms,
> is consistent with this objective.  While the 1988 X.400 Recommendation offers
> similar services, its employment by DMS would require use of "trusted" MTAs, a
> prospect that is not only cost prohibitive by lacking in deployment
> flexibility.

> 
>     2.2  Key Management Support.  MSP was designed to be independent of
> cryptographic algorithms and key management schemes.  Although 1988 X.400
> maintains independence of the cryptographic algorithms used, it does employ a
> specific key management scheme as defined in CCITT Recommendation X.509.  The
> protocol mechanisms that realized this key management scheme are incompatible
> with MSP key management.
> 
>       2.2.1  A solution consistent with the MSP concept might be implemented
> within the X.400 syntax, but would represent a semantic inconsistency.  Within
> X.400, no syntax exists to exchange multiple certificates and other per-
> message security data.
> 
>       2.2.2  Even if a certifiable architecture using MSP-like key management
> schemes could be developed to be consistent with 1988 X.400, it would likely
> represent a substantial departure from COTS products.
> 
>     2.3  Performance.  Like MSP, the 1988 X.400 Recommendation defines both
> per-message and per-recipient security data items.  However, the allocation of
> security relevant data, especially the signature and receipt information, is
> different in X.400 and in MSP.  1988 X.400 requires one signature per
> recipient while MSP requires one per message.  The major performance
> implications of this difference are the higher number of signature generation
> operations required by 1988 X.400, and the higher volume of additional data
> carried in each 1988 X.400 message.
> 
> 3.  Allied Interoperability.
> 
>     3.1  Suggestions from the Allied Message Handling International Subject
> Matter Experts Working Group (AMH ISME WG) recommend that the U.S. incorporate
> MSP mechanisms with the 1988 X.400 framework.  In reviewing this, technical
> difficulties surface as previously discussed, and present a resultant product
> which is semantically non-conformant with the 1988 X.400 Recommendation.  This
> suggestion is unacceptable from a security protection standpoint, and is cost
> prohibitive.
> 
>     3.2  The differences in the MSP and 1988 X.400 security protection
> strategies as described in the rationale serve to illustrate an allied message
> interoperability issue.  It is evident that the U.S. will continue to pursue
> implementation of MSP while U.S. allies, including NATO, appear poised to
> pursue implementations of the 1988 X.400 Recommendation.  When the U.S. begins
> deployment of X.400/MSP components in the 1996 and beyond time frame, a MSP
> gateway will be required to facilitate interoperability between users who have
> implemented X.400 with MSP and users who have not.  A Gateway will be required
> to perform protocol mappings between MSP and X.400-based systems, and to
> provide the required cryptographic and key management conversion services for
> the systems employed.  This Gateway will facilitate U.S. transition to MSP, as
> well as provide interoperability with allied users during the international
> transition to X.400.

> 4. Conclusions.
> 
>     4.1  Based on the rational provided above, the U.S. concludes that use of
> MSP is superior to 1988 X.400 security protection in terms of assurance, key
> management, performance, deployment flexibility, and cost.
> 
>     4.2  As indicated above, allied interoperability will require an MSP
> Gateway.  The AMH ISME WG is an excellent forum to collect requirements for
> this Gateway to ensure its timely development and deployment, and
> effectiveness in providing near term allied interoperability.  Long term
> interoperability is being analyzed and will be the subject of a 15 February
> 1992 U.S. submission to the AMH ISME WG.
