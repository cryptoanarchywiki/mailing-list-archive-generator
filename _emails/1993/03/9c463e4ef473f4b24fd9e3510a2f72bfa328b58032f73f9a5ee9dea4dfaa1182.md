Yes, a very valid point.  But it seems to me, that Random Data
claim is the best, with the highest chances to keep one out of
trouble (if anything can :-).

The algorithm? Oh, sorry, but it's a HARDWARE random data generator!
And if it's truly good random gen, there are no patterns to track...
One can use it to create huge one-time pads, BTW...   "Salt" some of
the encrypted (or plaintext :-) messages with those...

The only thing to be concerned of - the cipher [to be claimed a
random data] shouldn't be crackable, and SHOULDN'T have any
patterns! Or they could present an evidence, that the
data isn't a product of your random gen...
