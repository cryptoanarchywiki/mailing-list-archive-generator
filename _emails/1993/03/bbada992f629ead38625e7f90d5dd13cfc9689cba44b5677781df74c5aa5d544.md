What they are going to do is produce talk radio programs in professional
audio studios, and then instead of broadcasting on the air, they will
convert it all to a large (estimated about 15MB) sound file, which is
then widely distributed using ftp, and played by anyone who wants,
on their workstation (or a PC with a sound card).

I have an article on it, if you want me to send it to you, let me know.
