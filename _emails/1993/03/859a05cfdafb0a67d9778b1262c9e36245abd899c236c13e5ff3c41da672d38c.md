I obtained another copy of pgp22.zip for the cypherpunks archive site.
The previous one was the same length, but had some difference buried
in the middle.  The new one seems fine.  All those who had trouble
might want to download it again.  I also put up another copy of
pgp22src.zip, since it left and I don't know where it went.
