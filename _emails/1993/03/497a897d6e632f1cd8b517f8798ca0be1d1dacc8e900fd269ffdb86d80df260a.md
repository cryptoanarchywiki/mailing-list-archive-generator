     I thought that someone would bring it up, but since no one has, I
guess I will.  Isn't is very easy to accidentally type na1234 or an1234
when intending the other?  It's just a matter of transposing two
characters.  This could result in a user signing a message that is
sent with the anonymous ID or accidentally sending the actual address
when thinking it was anonymous.  Since a password can be assigned,
the prior could be eliminated, but the latter is still possible.

     I commend Johan for his work and appreciate the new service,
regardless of how it may sound.
