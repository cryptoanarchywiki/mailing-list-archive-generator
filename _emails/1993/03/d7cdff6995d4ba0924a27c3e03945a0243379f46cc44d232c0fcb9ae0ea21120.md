     I heard some discussion on here a while back regarding problems
getting the Elm Perl scripts included in 2.2 to work correctly.  I too have
had this problem, and have very limited knowledge of Perl.  Did anyone ever
get something working smoothly?  I've munged around with the script in
every way I feel safe doing, and somewhere along the lines, it's still
choking.
