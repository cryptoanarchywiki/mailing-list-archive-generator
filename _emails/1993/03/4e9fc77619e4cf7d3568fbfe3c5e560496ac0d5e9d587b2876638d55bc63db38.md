My "old" PGP key died with my PSI account. The new key is below, and can be
accessed by fingering my secondary mail address, ajay@holonet.net.

If the list server ops would kindly kill my old key (which should have my
name and an attached address of p00258@psilink.com), I'd appreciate it.

Scary thought: If any goon wanted to trace remailers, with the Clintoon
Administration now accepting E-Mail, all one would have to do is send a
threatening message through a remailer and it would give the brownshirt
squad license to do all kinds of things.

A government bent on knowing everything might even initiate such a move
itself. How do the people running remailers and those of us who might have
occasion to use them deal with this straw man threat?
