Re. cyphertext and music: I've been professionally involved in the
recording/production scene and could arrange something.  There are plenty of
damn good bands in the Bay Area who might volunteer for this kind of thing;
I can think of a couple of candidates right away.  Also a great local
studio, Polymorph Productions, which would be amenable to this.  All we need
to get going is for someone to cover the actual cost of studio time, which
is only $30/hour.  Now the only hitch right now is my own schedule being
really really busy, but I could get a free weekend, or hook up some local
cypherpunx with the bands and the studio, and see where it goes.  Basically
I get the idea that if this worked, the record would get a lot of interest
including from a wider audience than cypherpunx, and that translates into
attention on the band as such, and that translates into paying back the
original production investment with interest.   So, anyone interested...?
