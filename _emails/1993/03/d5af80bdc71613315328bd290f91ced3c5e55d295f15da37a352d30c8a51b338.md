I have a couple of camcorders, a video digitizer for my Mac, a scanner
(1-bit only--bought as a bundle with TypeReader, a wonderful OCR program),
etc. Equipment isn't the problem, per se, it's the lack of standards (e.g.,
so what if *I* put a message into a GIF with Adobe Photoshop--others have
to be able to extract it).

We won't be seeing digitized images as carriers of secret messages in wide
use anytime soon. In this sense, I agree with Uri's point.

Doubtful--too widespread. JPEG, MPEG, and a zillion other image standards
are spreading. Big Brother can't ban images, GIFs, JPEG stuff, QuickTime
movies, etc., without shutting down the economy. And digitized voice works
just as well for the LSB method, albeit with a different software approach.
Modem-based voice handling systems are already widespread, and the
"Internet Talk Radio" concept discussed here last week indicates the
feasibility of sending packetized audio. Such a mail system is already
available for the NeXT, I gather.
