While writing some appropriate paranoia for a canned response to
remailer info requests, I realized that running a remailer is a
perfect prelude to blackmail.  An unscrupulous person running a
remailer can obviously keep records of truenames, along with
messages that their senders do not want associated with them.
Making use of this information could involve a scenario to the
crypto-extortion previously discussed, but blackmail would be far
more believable than anonymous threats.  Alternatively, the
blackmailer could be low-tech and resort to present techniques.

Always encrypting helps with mail, but not with news.
