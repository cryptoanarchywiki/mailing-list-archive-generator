Hey, man, we're the cypherpunks.  We're too hip to worry about a 
trivial little mail bomb.  But if we did get upset...well, who
do you think has the bigger arsenal of dirty tricks, him or us?

Heh.

p.s.  I'm being interviewed by a campus radio show, regarding
cypherpunk-related stuff.  I'd welcome any suggestions on topics to
bring up, or ammunition to add to my pro-privacy and pro-anonymity
arguments.  Send them directly to me and I'll summarize to the list.
