But don't buy the articles.  Get them at the library.  No point in giving them 
your money and your opinions! ;^)

Next time someone tells me to get in touch with someone to complain to and 
doesn't give me their address, I'LL SCREEM!  Not a flame, just a (subtle) 
suggestion. ;^)

a "proper" understanding of our fears/outrage.

Just my $.02.
