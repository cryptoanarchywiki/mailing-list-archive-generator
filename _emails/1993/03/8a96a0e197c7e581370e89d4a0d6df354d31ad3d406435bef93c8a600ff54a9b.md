They won't harrass you, they'll harrass your connectivity provider.

To this end, it would be beneficial to collect connectivity policies
in the face of complaints from the major service providers.  Alternet,
for starters, and all the others I'm not really familiar with.

I learned a couple of weeks ago that Sprint is now offering IP
connectivity direct.  I would guess that Sprint has a good track
record from being in the long distance business for not telling their
customers to go away because someone they are talking to doesn't like
what they are saying.

To wit: who can I buy IP from who will not disconnect me unless I
don't pay?

Eric
