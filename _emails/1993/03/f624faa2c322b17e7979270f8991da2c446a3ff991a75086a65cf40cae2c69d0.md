This information is generally useful for the following tactical reasons:

1. Anonymous remailers are disapproved of.
2. Pressure is brought to bear against the operators of such systems.
3. All the owners of the machines and the communications channels must
   not give in to such pressure in order to avoid shutdown.
4. Private ownership of remailer nodes seems essential.
5. No organizations have volunteered use of their machines.
6. Personal ownership by individuals seems necessary in order to get this
   off the ground.

We don't need to discuss it much, but news is appreciated.

Eric
