ted, i think that with just a little of the right technical stuff, it is
very easy to establish a nym in today's nets.  e.g., if you buy a cheap
unix box, it comes with uucp, so you can hook up to one of many anonymous
uucp sites.

that's easy.

i know of several slip/ppp endpoints that aren't password protected.  more
every day, in fact.

that's easy.

perhaps it's this easy with fido.  the point of remailers is to enable this
technology to the technologically challenged.  (as well as to explore the
technical and social space that nyms define.)
