I was able to procure a tempest specced HP Laserjet + (model 2686 TA),
used around a year ago and recently did a motherboard swap to upgrade
the unit to 2mb of RAM...wasn't all that much to rip apart and put back
together...even with all the damn machined-screws and shielding, the thing
still emits a fair amount of noise, but no farther than the room it's in...
I checked all my cables and system box and switched to shielded cables and
cleaned up the the noise as best I could...interesting design and at least
I would see the damn snoops...they'd have to be in my front yard to pick it
up...anyone else hack any used TEMPEST stuff?
