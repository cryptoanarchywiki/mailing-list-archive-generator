Uh... If anon.penet.fi charged $0.10 / message for the 3000 messages a
day it's curently handling that would give me $9,000/month - no problem

*Quiet* the flame wars? I can already hear them scream "and he is even
getting *money* from terrorizing the net!!" ;-)

I think anon.penet.fi will have to remain a for-free, public service...
