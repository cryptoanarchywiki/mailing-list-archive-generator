I just read in the local paper about "Internet Radio," which sounds like
some kind of transmission of compressed audio, if I have the details right.

This could be interesting. The "Crypto Home Companion Show"?

Virginia, so perhaps Strat and our other D.C. area folks have heard more
about this.)
