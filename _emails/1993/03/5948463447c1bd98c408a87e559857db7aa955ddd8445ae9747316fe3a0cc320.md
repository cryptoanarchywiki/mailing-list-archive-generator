I don't agree it was appropriate to notify the administrator. This could
all have been handled far more elegantly considering the circumstances.

Thank you for this information. I will attempt these courses of action.
Perhaps if someone had attempted to offer helpful information from the
outset, this problem never would have reached this level. Instead certain
individuals chose to post arrogant promises of "retribution" against
others, rather than trying to be constructive in this.

>Retaliatory strikes aren't right either, of course.

I agree wholeheartedly, and I am glad this discourse now finally seems to
be moving onto a level-headed and constructive level. I appeal to all of
the cypherpunks to keep it this way! Let's figure what's going wrong here
and resolve the situation instead of playing one-upmanship with mail bombs
and threats of "dirty tricks".
