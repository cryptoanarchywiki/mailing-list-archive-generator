Yes, I know they don't want me to do this because they don't respect my
privacy.  Not because I am doing anything illegal.  If I pay my taxes on
the money, I should be allowed to stash it anywhere I fucking please.

I never said the checking account would be used for tax evasion.  Assuming,
I pay taxes on all my income, I don't see why it should be illegal to 
deposit it in a checking account under, let us say, my dogs name. Hell, there
are these old ladies who die and leave all their money to their cats, right?
So I assume the cats must have somekind of bank accounts / trusts.  What if
I want to set up a bank account for my dog? I don't see why that should
be illegal.  I mean if it's a problem with setting up accounts under
non-existant people's identities, one could always use the family pet as
the bank account holder.
