     Actually, it's almost entirely the cables, and somewhat the screen
(CRT, that is).  A shielded CPU box isn't going to be giving off really any
appreciable amount of RF waves, certainly not enough to read coherently.
An LCD will help, since they don't emit the same kind of signals (no CRT),
and no cables going to them.
