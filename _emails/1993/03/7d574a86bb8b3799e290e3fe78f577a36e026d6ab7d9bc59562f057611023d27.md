   I don't know how many of you are at sites on the MBONE, or multicast 
   backbone. There are already a few pieces of code out there for 
   experimentation with transmission of audio and video information, in a 
   variety of forms/encoding, and probably the most widely used tool,
   "vat - the  Visual Audio Tool", already has provisions for carrying
   on encrypted audio teleconferences via IP.  In fact, it's as simple
   as typing a key into a field, and the tool will DES en/decrypt the
   conference.  

That's a good start!  Now all we need something which is a bit more
general in its selection of the asymmetric encryption algorithm, and
something which does public key for authentication and protection of the
assymetric session key.
