Yes.

For some time, I've been advocating (over in sci.crypt)

	compress|des-cbc|tran|des-cbc|tran|des-cbc

instead of normal triple DES.  tran is not an encryption algorithm so it's
been posted worldwide several times and is available from me by mail or on
a few ftp sites.  It does a pseudo-random transposition of a variable
length block (up to 8KB) -- using the sum of bytes in the first block as
the key to the PRNG.  [That could be better and I'm planning to do an
improvement -- using the histogram of the bytes of the first block as a
much larger key to the PRNG.]  tran is a self-inverse.

This dosen't guarantee bit diffusion -- but does diffuse the probability of
change (of a single output bit, given a changed single input bit) evenly
over a big block.

For operation within a single chip, I'd advocate yours rather than this
tran.

Of course, one could also do (for S/W solutions):

	compress|des-cbc|tran|idea-cbc|tran|des-cbc

There's no reason for pipelined operations like yours or mine to be slower
than a single cipher.  The pipelines need to be kept full.  That means
that you feed the chip data with one set of handshaking and take data from
it with another set.  You don't treat the chip like an RPC.  As long as
you think UNIX pipes, it will make sense.
