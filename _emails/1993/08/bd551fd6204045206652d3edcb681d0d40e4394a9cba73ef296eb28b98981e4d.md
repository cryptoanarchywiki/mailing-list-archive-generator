Cypherdenizens, 

I have been trying to decode this message which found its way into our group:

I've tried all the usual tricks: analyzing the whitespace, looking for
meaning in the names, etc. But it still doesn't turn into anything
meaningful.

Oh well, maybe the boys in the NSA just got their wires crossed (ac to
dc, so to speak) and piped GayNet into our list. If _we're_ confused,
imagine how Wolf and Jim and their pals must feel reading about
Clipper and CELP and chaotic compression!
