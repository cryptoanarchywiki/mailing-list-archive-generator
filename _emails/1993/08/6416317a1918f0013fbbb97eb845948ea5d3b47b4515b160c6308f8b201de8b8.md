I feel rather in the dark.  If you are going to say something, please
say it.  I had my circumlocution buffer filled by noon today by others
who beat you to the punch.  However, the mere mention of money makes my
cute little ears stand right up, assuming it's not in non-negotiable
digital gold coins, which niether my landlady nor the Arab bodega where
I buy my menudo will accept...
