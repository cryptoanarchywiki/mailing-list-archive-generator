Hi,

A PostScript pre-print of the final version of my paper "A Cryptographic File
System for Unix" is available for anonymous ftp from research.att.com
in the file dist/mab/cfs.ps .  The paper will be presented at the
1st ACM Conference on Communications and Computing Security, November
3-5, Fairfax, VA.

A number of people on this list have seen an early draft; this
is the final version.  Some of the techniques in the paper may be
of general interest to people contemplating file system-level encryption
in other systems (e.g., the cryptostacker project).
