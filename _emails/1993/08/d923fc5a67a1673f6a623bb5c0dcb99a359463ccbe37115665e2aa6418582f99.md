 To All,
       The idea of second tier remailers may be MUCH more palatable to all to
run as they add more hops in the chain... as they dont introduce such a visible
liability to the operator they could possibly be a LOT easier to propagate
than first tier remailers. One additional facility neede is the ability
to recognize a signed and/or encrypted control message to update their
remailer maps from a periodic posting...maybe this last needs a lot of thought.
   cheers
   kelly
