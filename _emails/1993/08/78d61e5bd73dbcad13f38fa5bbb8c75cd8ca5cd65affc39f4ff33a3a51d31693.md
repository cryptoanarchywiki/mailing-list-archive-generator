  If your goal is only privacy of personal information not economic privacy
you would do better to support Clipper-like systems (such as DigiCash
with an IRS-Tax Backdoor). Supporting untracable perfectly secure
cash will make taxation and state economic planning hard if not impossible.
It is contradictory for a liberal to support DigiCash, Strong Cryptography,
etc because effective collective coercion requires personal information.
All you have to do is take perfect anonymity to its natural conclusion
and you see where it leads. (and it ain't socialism)
