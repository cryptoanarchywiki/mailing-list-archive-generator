	I used cold call for a home improvement company while I was in high
school.  Generally "Our salesman is going to be in your neighboorhood" is
just a way to get people to feel like they'd better look at the product now
rather than later.  It doesn't mean they know where you live.  However,
unless your number is unlisted it will probably be in the Coles directory
(along with such information as how long you've lived at that residence). 
It sounds like an ordinary cold call.
