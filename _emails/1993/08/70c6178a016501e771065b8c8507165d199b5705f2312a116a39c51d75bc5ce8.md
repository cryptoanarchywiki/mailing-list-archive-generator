Distance travelled: 14.31 miles. 
Time elapsed: 13.86 minutes. 
Average speed: 61.95 MPH
Speed Limit: 55 MPH
Excess Speed: 6.95 MPH
Penalty: 6.95 x $50 = $347.50

This is your 8th speeding ticket in the past 23.17 months. Your
accumulated excess speed penalty is 81.03 MPH, resulting in an
additional $519 surcharge for abusing the National Health Care Plan
through dangerous driving. Your insurance rates have also been
automatically increased $125 per year for each ticket.

If you wish to contest this, pay the fee, pay a $425 court fee, and
bring your own evidence. We estimate your court date will be 7.23
years from now.

Have a nice day.
