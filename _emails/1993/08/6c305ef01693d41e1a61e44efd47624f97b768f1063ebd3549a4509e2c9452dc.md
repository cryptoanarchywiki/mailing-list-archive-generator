Cypherpunks in Washington, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Seattle, 

(and if someone wants to forward this to the Extropians list, which I
am temporarily taking a break from, I'm sure some of them would be interested)

The Internet service I use, NETCOM, is expanding into these cities,
offering flat-rate service for $17.50 a month (if paid by credit
card). I have no connection with them except for being a satisfied
user.

Many hacker friends of mine have NETCOM accounts, even if they have
ordinary corporate addresses as well (at a Bay Area Extropians lunch,
about 8 out of the dozen folks had NETCOM accounts). After all, NETCOM
can't lay you off, can't complain about what you say, and essentially
can't be leaned on by the Feds (not yet tested, but likely). A useful
service. Some people use it mostly for their mail, and then just
telnet to NETCOM to grab it.

(NETCOM provides 5 MB for your files, but charges beyond that.)

NETCOM also carries every newsgroup I've ever heard of, 4560 of them
at last count, and even carried the controversial group
"alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children," about which I wrote a while
back (I mention this mainly to show how much of a hands-off policy
NETCOM takes). So far as I know, NETCOM has only kicked people out for
advertising competing Internet services blatantly, in the netcom.*
locall groups. Everything else seems to be fair game. (Some of the
most notorious Net bozos are NETCOM folks, indicating further the
freedom we have....I can't imagine any user on NETCOM being
"disciplined" for racist, sexist, homophobic, or speciesist remarks.)

And a full range of editors, newsreaders, mailreaders, ftp access,
telnet, etc...all the usual stuff, managed well. There are usually
enough modems to allow me to get on anytime I want to. And, to repeat,
there are no connect charges and no time limits. If you're within the
local call range of the nearest POP, you can stay logged-on as long as
you like with no charges.

It changed my life, no kidding.
