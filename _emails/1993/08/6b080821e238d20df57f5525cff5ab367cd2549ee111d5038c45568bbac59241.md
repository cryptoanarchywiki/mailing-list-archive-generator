They got me. At the DMV. Today. Yuck.
 
Bought a new (used) car and had to do all that fun stuff -- license, 
tags, etc, ad nauseam and decided to get my license updated to reflect my 
new mailing address while I'm there. Of course, I expected it, because my 
wife had it done to her earlier this year, but seeing the final product 
leaves a knot in your throat.
 
Digitized photographs, in the database of the state. (insert appropriate 
parable here)
 
Ptheewww!  At least they were quick about it. Too bad they don't have 
dial-in service. ,-)
 
Cheers,
