Two points of clarification:

1) I do not now, nor have I in the past advocated the violent overthrow
   of any domestic government.  I am also opposed to the overthrow of
   foreign governments on moral grounds.

2) The necessity to distance ones self or organization (as may have occured
   in the case of the Libertarian Party) from what should be in effect
   an expression of free speech, smacks of McCarthyistic opression.

(this was what was hidden beneath the cynicism and 'waffle')

Thanks for rising to the occasion.

A country that can have a McCarthy Era has no business giving more power
to its government.
