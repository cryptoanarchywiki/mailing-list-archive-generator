I'm not sure whether it is fair to call Walter Tuchman
a Real Cryptanalyst, but there are many reasons to suspect 
that he is a talented one. When he headed the IBM team
developing DES, it is said (by Coppersmith) that they 
developed many attacks like what we now know as 
Differential Cryptanalysis. These contributed to their
design of DES and I think it would be fair to say that
the same principles could be used to assess the strength 
of the Clipper chip. A Mykotronix employee told me that
it "Contains s-boxes and all that stuff." 

I don't know whether he was the one responsible for these insights
back then, but he certainly was in the right place to learn
alot by osmosis.
