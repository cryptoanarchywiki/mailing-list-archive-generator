Newsgroups tend to have a lot smaller S/N ratio, in general, than
mailing lists.  Granted, the S/N ration of this list varies, but I
think its always been a lot better than many of the better newsgroups.
Making cypherpunks a newsgroup will just lower the S/N ratio without
helping increase anything else (other than readership).

If you think there is too much traffic, have the mail go to some other
account that you only log into when you have the time.  Hitting the
"d" key in mh-rmail isn't that much overhead! ;-)

Cypherpunks should stay in e-mail.
