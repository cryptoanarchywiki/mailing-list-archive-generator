I think you mean "Spooking of neural nets and image recognition..."

This technology is supposedly being deployed at Customs offices and
especially at airports.

Long hair may come back, as I hear that the _ear_ is one of the main
identifying points...ears are fairly characteristic of individuals
(not as much as fingerprints, but enough for a rough sort) and
edge-tracing algorithms can be run quickly. So, keep those ears
covered!

Of course, only criminals fear such security monitoring. Remember, the
policement is your _friend_.
