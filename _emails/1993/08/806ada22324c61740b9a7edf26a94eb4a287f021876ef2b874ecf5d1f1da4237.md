While you're at it, another source for traffic analysis is DNS requests;
you may want to cache these for the sites you commonly connect to,
or at least put a DNS server on your machine to do some caching.
In a mature environment, most of your anonymous traffic will go to
other remailers anyway, but might as well cut down on the logging opportunities.
