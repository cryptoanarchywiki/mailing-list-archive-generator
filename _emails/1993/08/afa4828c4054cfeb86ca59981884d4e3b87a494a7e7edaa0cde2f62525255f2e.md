I find it interesting that the United States was formed via the venue of
armed rebellion, but disqualifies anyone from public service who advocates
the same.  As a friend says, "the first thing the revolutionary government
does when they get in power is to ... ban all revolutions!"

It is also interesting to note that Jefferson, Paine, and others of the era
advocated, even supported, the right of the people to overthrow an oppressive
government, even their own.
