How will supernetworks transport you to the far reaches of the data
galaxy?  What is the current status of the internet and other
"information highways"? What can these "highways" do for you today?

This next Sunergy live broadcast will focus on the issues and
technologies surrounding the worldwide movement of information.  It
will take a look at the internet, information suppliers, information
retrievers and the other related resources.  Discussions will also
include regulation and security on the internet. Some current
technologies will be demonstrated.

Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.

For a dozen years prior to assuming his present position in 1991,
Diffie was Manager of Secure Systems Research for Northern Telecom,
functioning as the center of expertise in advanced security
technologies throughout the corporation.  Among his achievements in
this position was the design of the key management architecture for
NT's recently released PDSO security system for X.25 packet networks.

Diffie received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1965.  Prior to
becoming interested in cryptography, he worked on the development of
the Mathlab symbolic manipulation system --- sponsored jointly at
Mitre and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory --- and later on
proof of correctness of computer programs at Stanford University.  He
is the recipient of the IEEE Information Theory Society Best Paper
Award for 1979 and the IEEE Donald E. Fink award for 1981.
