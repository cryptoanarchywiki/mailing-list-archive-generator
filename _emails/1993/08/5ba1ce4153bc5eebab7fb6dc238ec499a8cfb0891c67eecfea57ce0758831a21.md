I don't know if this is what you were asking, but:

The LPF is very strongly against the SPI, and requests that people
refrain from providing it with ANY information that might assist it in
building a database containing software patent information.  This
database, whatever its intended use may be, can assist
leeches^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hlawyers in building bulletproof software patents
by making information on prior art available to them.  It will have a
user interface in the same style as LEXIS/NEXUS (sp?), and that
suggests that it is inteded for the lawyers rather than for us (no
offense intended to Mike).
