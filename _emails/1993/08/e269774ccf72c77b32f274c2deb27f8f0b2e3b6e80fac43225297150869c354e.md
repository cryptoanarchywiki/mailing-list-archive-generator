Posted by a misguided, hysterical, raster-burned ranter:

What happens when one of these HR4079, Digital
Telephony, Clipper/Capstone/Skipjack proposals passes,
and Cyphernacht takes place? Storm troopers will throw
your nice little PC's on the ground to ruin the hard
drives, and only the new, improved hard drives, with
access for legitimate law enforcement needs will be sold.


Storm troopers?  You take this all a little too seriously.
What makes you think that you and your nasty little private
secrets warrent the time, money and effort of non-existant
storm-troopers?
