                          Friendly Spies

                  How America's allies are using
                       economic espionage
                      to steal our secrets

                       By Peter Schweizer
                        ISBN 0-87113-497-7
                        'bout twenty bucks

 I would have to rate this as a must read for anyone concerned with
Privacy. Schweizer has written a very informative, and well written
text describing in great detail the involvement of so called
"friendly" inteligence services in corporate espionage.
