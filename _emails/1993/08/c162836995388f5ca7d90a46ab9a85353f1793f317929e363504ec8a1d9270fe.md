As an aside, all this talk about anonymous remailers is intriguing.
 
Does anyone know with certainty what happens at the remailer site,
within the software process of stripping headers and the likes, where
the original sender of the message could be tracked? SENDMAIL logs,
etc.?
 
What would be preferrable, in ideal scenario, would be that all traces
of the incoming message was discarded altogether. In this fashion, the
operator of the remailer would be less likely to be "persuaded" to
divulge the originator(s) of messages, if found in such a precarious
position.
