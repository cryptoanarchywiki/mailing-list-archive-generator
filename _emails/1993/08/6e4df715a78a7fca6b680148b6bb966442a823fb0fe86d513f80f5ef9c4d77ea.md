Hi,
	If my understanding of GAs is correct (not a given), they operate
by progressively narrowing the search space until they arrive at the
solution.  More clearly, each generation uses information gleaned from 
previous generations to guide the current search.  The operation depends
on being able to take two sets of input parameters and decide which
operates better than the other.  I'm not a cryptographer, so I don't
know whether there is a way to find out if an answer is "close" to the
actual.  If not, GAs will probably be of little use.
