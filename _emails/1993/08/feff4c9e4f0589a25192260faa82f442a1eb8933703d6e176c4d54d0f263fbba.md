A nice thought, but it is not quite true now, is it?  Cryptography has been
a tool for specialists, scholars, and governments for those 4000 years, but
to claim that "the masses" have had access to it is clearly untrue.  In
fact, it seems that the current friction between groups such as this one
and the U.S. governement is caused mostly because private citizens are
beginning to get access to this strong cryptography and this is something
"those who watch" do not like...
