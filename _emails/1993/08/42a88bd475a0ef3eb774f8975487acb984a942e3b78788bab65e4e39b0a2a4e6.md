I don't recall seeing articles saying that the government officially
decided to stop calling Clipper Clipper, and start calling it Skipjack,
because of the trademark infringement. I wonder when this actually
happened. Just another little humiliation...

>To avoid a trademark conflict, the government is renaming Clipper to Skipjack. 

p.s. Of course we should keep calling it Clipper out of perverse glee
(did anyone see the recent Simpsons where the infant Bart kept calling
his dad Homer? hee, hee).

PANEL TO REVIEW SKIPJACK (AKA CLIPPER)
=============================================================

The National Institute of Standards and Technology has selected five people to 
review the classified encryption algorithm Skipjack, also popularly known as 
Clipper. The government proposes Skipjack as a new standard for encrypting 
voice communications.

To avoid a trademark conflict, the government is renaming Clipper to Skipjack. 
The five reviewers will be Ernest Brickell of Sandia National Laboratories, 
Dorothy Denning of Georgetown University (also on the CRA board), Stephen Kent 
of BBN Communications, David Maher of AT&T, and Walter Tuchman of Amperif Corp.
