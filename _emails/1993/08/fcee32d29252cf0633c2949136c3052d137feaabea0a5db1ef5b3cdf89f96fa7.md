Actually I have used IRC for quite some time.  I have also noticed that
most of the time there is not much of a problem in "annoying" people. 
Also the power of the Operator is much in question when it comes to
banning people, as to how easy it is to overcome being "banned" from a
channel.  You make the example of how anyone in a "bad mood" can ruin the
channel for everyone.  This is something you have to deal with.  Ask
people running Anonymous Remailers, and Anonymous Posting Services.

I did not intend to connect this up with the "Normal IRC Network".  That
would be a little rude on my part.  Allowing people to become anonymous
only on my server.  Also I would suspect most other people who run servers
would not let mine conenct to theirs.

I am not trying to start up a server to be in competition with the "Normal
IRC Network".  I want an alternative for people who wish to talk, but
don't wish their identity known.
