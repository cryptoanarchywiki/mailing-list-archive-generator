Ok, so far as I know, both of those remailers are still active, but at
least one of them blocks posts from all the anonymous remailers that the
operators know of. (I don't think they know of mine yet.) To post a
message to alt.fan.david-sternlight use the address of
alt-fan-david-sternlight
when posting to the remailer. Or so I've heard, someplace on this list a
while back I think. BTW, My remailer is still haveing trouble decrypting
messages sent to it, but unencrypted remailing requests still work fine.

I second the motion. Good Idea Mike.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
