I just heard a little of the report on NPR on Saturday, but it
seems that the FBI went public last week at a security conference
with its desires to ban cryptography, at least crypto that it cannot
break.  The FBI said that in four different wiretap cases, it got
encrypted messages instead of talk.

I know that the FBI has previously announced similar plans including
at CFP-2, but this seems to be a new salvo.
