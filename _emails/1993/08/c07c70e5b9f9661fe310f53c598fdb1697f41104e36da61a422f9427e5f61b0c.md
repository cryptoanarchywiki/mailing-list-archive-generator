I dunno, but the Aug/Sept 1993 issue of PC Techniques magazine
contains a notice on page 100 of the publication of something that
might be useful. It's a C library of encryption routines (Microsoft
and Borland compatible). "The encryption method is a symmetric key
encryption process applicable both to blocks of data in RAM ... and
also to data residing in disk files. ...  Full source code is
included ..."   Unfortunately it's not free (though I don't suppose
there's any reason why it should be).  The notice says further details
are available from the publisher at 510-464-3009.
