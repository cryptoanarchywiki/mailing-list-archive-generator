To the best of my knowledge, PKZip uses a simple Vigenere algorithm for its
encryption. There is a program called "zipcrack", widely available on BBSes,
that does cryptanalysis of encrypted PKZip files. The rumor is that the 
"zipcrack" program originated in Russia, but really, cryptanalysis of the stuff
that PK is using is relatively trivial.
 
There are many good implementations of DES, including Symantec's in the Norton
Utilities. You could also use PGP. But don't rely on PKZip to protect your 
privacy. That's not what it's designed for.
 
Note the reply-to address above if you wish to reply.
