   Could the NSA reverse PGP encryption on a message that was iencrypted with
a 1264bit key? Do you think they could do this in a matter of hours? Why, or
why not? How long would it take? What do you know that corroborates this?

This is a genereic question, which I hope aeveryone who knows about  this
will attempt to answer. If this is not the right subject for the LIST, send
replies via EMAIL to

wesley@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu

Thanks
