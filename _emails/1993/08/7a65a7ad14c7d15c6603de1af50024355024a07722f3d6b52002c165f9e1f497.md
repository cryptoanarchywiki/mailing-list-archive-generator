By ignoring it like all other forms of "others" government (tyranny).  How 
anyone can think that more efficiently allowing others to rule them 
(whether one man or many) is a good idea is beyond me.  Tyrrany is tyrrany 
is tyranny.  Maybe with ED we'll be benefitted by the fact that the 
government itself which is carrying out the orders of the populace will be 
so busy with system volitility that it won't have time to do much real 
harm.
