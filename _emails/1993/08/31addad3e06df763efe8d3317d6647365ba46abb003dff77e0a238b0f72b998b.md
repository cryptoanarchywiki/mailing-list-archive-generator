Yeah. Or even run BSDI on your 386SX notebook. That's what I'm doing.
I don't want to use DOS, with all it's cruft. Much prefer a system I have full

Yeah. And... Well... I don't want to get into any religious battles, but I
still prefer BSDI (the support is great and the networking code is much more
