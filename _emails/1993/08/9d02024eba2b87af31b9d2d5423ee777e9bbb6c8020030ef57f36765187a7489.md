        I second that.  I _don't_ have Usenet access (I actually would be
willing to read 280MB a week), or ftp access.  This mailing list is my only
source of information of this kind.
 
        If this person can back their rationale with a e-mail gateway to
usenet newsgroups (not just an e-mail POSTING server like utexas'), I might
see some justification...
