I would love to write pages about how Apple used to supply ROM code
for free with its machines and now sends the FBI after people who
simply get portions of their code, or about how they 'went corporate'
and betrayed all of the people who were loyal throughout the Steve^2 era,
but instead I'll say:

Please don't argue about this here.  It may have some relevance to
Cypherpunks, but it is an emotionally charged issue and neither side
will ever convert the other; this will just degenerate in to a
mindless flame war, getting nowhere fast.  Don't flood the list.

If you do decide to continue this, keep using anonymous remailers;
Strat is vicious when he's pissed, just ask Dave.

<ducks and runs for cover, hoping that Strat doesn't know where he
lives <grin>>
