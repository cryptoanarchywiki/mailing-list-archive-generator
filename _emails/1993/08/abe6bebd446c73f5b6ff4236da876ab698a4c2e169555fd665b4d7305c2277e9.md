One question is how he will enforce his ban on encryption if he only
rarely reads the messages passing through. He could probably write a
shell script that looks for PGP headers, but these could be stripped off.
He could probably look for ascii-encoded files with a flat character
distribution, but these could be uuencoded or binhexed.

Perhaps it's time to integrate one of the steganographic techniques
into the remailers as a configuration option. By inflating the size of
the messages it hides, that will increase the load through the
machines that don't like encrypted messages, but that's life.
