Re this thread, I know someone on this list is also very active with EFF.
Could John tell us if EFF is on this case?  I would really be interested
in such details as did the cops get warrants for all the email on the
system?  If they did not, it is Alcor or Steve Jackson all over again.
(and several other cases which did not go very far because the cops 
found out how much trouble they were in.  :)  )  Keith Henson
PS, EFF would seem like a good place to administer a defense fund.
