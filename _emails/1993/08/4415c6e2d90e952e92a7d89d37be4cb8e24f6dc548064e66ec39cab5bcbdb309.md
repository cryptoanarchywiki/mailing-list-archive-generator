Although this is not the right place for discussing this topic, I can
suggest a reading of "The Theory Of Free Banking" by George Selgin,
which is an excellent economic treatise on why a bank might want to
hold a particular physical commodity as backing for bank issued notes
instead of relying on a central banking system. The book is an
expansion of Selgin's PhD thesis at NYU -- its pretty good.

Even barring this, however, a protocol to determine if claimed
deposits correspond with what depositors think their deposits are,
i.e. an audit protocol, has many uses and would be valuable. Its a
genuinely good problem.
