If you have the pc's aranged nicely there are very few packets that need
be sent.  You can use broadcasts on each net, or multicasting (broadcasting
to a group).  You simply need to send out the password entry to crack.
You could break up the job space by networks, and on each network have
the machines negotiate for portions of the sub-job space.  Alternatively
you could have all machines attacking the key space randomly which
is not as efficient but still quite workable.  Finally if/when one
of the boxes gets a solution, it shouts 'i got it'.  It can broadcast
the solution, which will turn off all the other boxes and get
put onto some consol window somewhere, or some file.
