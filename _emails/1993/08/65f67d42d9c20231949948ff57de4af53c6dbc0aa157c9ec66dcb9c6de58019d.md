Interestingly, I am coming to the conclusion that big business operates
on a web of trust very much like what is found in PGP.  There are
Dun&Bradstreet reports of course, but, bye-and-large, when a company
wants credit, they give a list of the other companies that they do
business with as evidence of their trustworthiness in receiving credit.

Peace ..Tom Jones
