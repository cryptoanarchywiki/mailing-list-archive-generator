Subject:Beepers can also be used to track you down!

I had heard that Motorola was talking about pagers based on the cellular
phone system, with hand off between cells, etc.   That would imply XMIT.

As far as local detection, I understand that in Britain vans go around
with sniffing gear looking for IF freqs to find unlicensed TVs.

When in the Air Force, we used to leave our pagers in Faraday cages when
going into some of the SCFs, which were built with the copper mesh in the
walls etc.  The idea being that you didn't want any being carried on
IF from the pager.

As far as the microwave oven, fine you can hide in there, but watch out
for them.. one of THEM may come by and turn it on...
