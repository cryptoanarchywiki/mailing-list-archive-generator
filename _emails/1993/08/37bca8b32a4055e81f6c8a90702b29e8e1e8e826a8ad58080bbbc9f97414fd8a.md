Somebody posted a Unix soundblaster driver on alt.sources, I
believe. Someone else will have to go digging though.

: Now, if anyone actually has an answer to the question, which was about

Well, I have an ancient AT manual that I could probably dig out.
But I don't think there's much trick to it.
