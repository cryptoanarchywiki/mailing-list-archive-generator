The first certificate attached to this message is a claim to ownership
of the first digital gold coin.  Some anonymous person is claiming
ownership of this coin simply because no one else has claimed it.  This
original owner has signed a deed granting ownership of the coin to
himself.  

The second attached certificate is a transfer of ownership of the same
digital coin.  The first owner has granted ownership of the coin to some
other anonymous person (who could be the original owner himself).  

If someone tries to offer you coin #1 in exchange for some good or
service, make sure his signature matches the public key in the latest
deed of ownership of coin #1.  (The first public key is now worthless,
by convention.)
