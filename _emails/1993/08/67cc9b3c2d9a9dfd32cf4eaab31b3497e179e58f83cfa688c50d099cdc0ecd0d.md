     Hi all!  Well, I'm getting married Aug. 7.  for our Honeymoon, we are
taking a driving trip through Pheonix, Az., Las Angeles, Ca., Sacramento,
Ca., and Denver Co.  I MIGHT be able get away from my wife in order to have
my pub key signed.  Are there any Cypherpunks in these cities who might be
willing to sign my key?  Thanx in advance.  Laters.
