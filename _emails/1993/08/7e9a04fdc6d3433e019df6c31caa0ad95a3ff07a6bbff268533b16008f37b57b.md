Yes, this seems to be a persistent rumour, though I've no idea how true
it might be. I uploaded PGP to a bulletin board a few months back and
received a message from another user claiming the same thing. (And taking
the same copout...)

I've been meaning to take a good look at the source for a while, I think
it's about time to investigate the key generation code.....
