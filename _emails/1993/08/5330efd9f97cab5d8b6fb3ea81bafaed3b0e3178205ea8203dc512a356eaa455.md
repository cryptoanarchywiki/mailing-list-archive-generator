It seems unsatisfactory for people to have to accept either all mail
from the remailer or none.  Can you not allow recipients to block mail
only from specific ids?  The sender of the mail can probably arrange
to send from a new id instead, but they're unlikely to if they're not
told that their mail was refused by the recipient.
