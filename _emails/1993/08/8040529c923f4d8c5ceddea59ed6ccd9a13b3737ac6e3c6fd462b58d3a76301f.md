We did this about 8 years ago at E&S using DEC VMS NOTES.  We used a 
plain vanilla secret key algorithm and a key shared by all legitimate
members of the group.  We could do it today -- but why bother?  If you
have a key that widespread, it's effectively certain that a "wrong person"
(however you define him/her) will have a copy of the key.
