I have been experimenting the past few days with anon remailer to USENET 
gateway systems to see what the results would be -- nada. I used Chael's 
BSU system (nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu) to attempt a usenet post which never 
(magically?) appeared in the desired group (alt.privacy, I believe). I 
waited for several days for the post, but nada, zilch, zero. I retried 
the bsu remailer with a test message to make sure it was still active, 
and yes, it seemed to work perfectly. My guess is that the usenet gateway 
at utexas refuses anon e-mail. Anyone got any other suggestions? I 
haven't tried any other gateways -- yet.

Cheers.
