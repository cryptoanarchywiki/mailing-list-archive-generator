In rereading my post earlier today on this issue, I can see I took
Scott to be referring to "a new standard" as any new specialized
hardware, such as the either the AV DSP stuff or the Clipper, etc. But
Scott was apparently using the _specific_ case of a Clipper inside as
the case he was citing.

Sorry for any confusion. I certainly agree that Clipper is far off, if
it happens, but specialized hardware is already a reality with the new
generation of AV Macs. 

And I don't dismiss the possibility, thought I consider it remote,
that the phone/modem tools have been delayed for reasons relating to
Clipper and key escrow. More likely, delayed because something just
didn't work in time for the announcement.
