A reminder to old subscribers, and a notice to new:  I have some software
running on this system (related to the remailer software) which can be
configured to send a PGP-encrypted version of the list to subscribers.
This way you can receive this "subversive" material without any local
system operators knowing what you are doing.

Send me your address and PGP public key if you'd like to be put on the
encrypted list.
