That's one of the strongest points in favor of crypto in wartime, for example.
The usefulness of a cryptosystem is not just a function of its resistance to
attack, it is also a function of how long it *has* to resist attack.  For
example, if the Nazis had broken a message regarding D-Day, encrypted with
a cipher in such a way that if the message were compromised it wouldn't
compromise the system itself, it wouldn't matter when they broke it, as long
as it was after June 4, 1944.  After that time, it's useless, and many
messages during tactical operations have an effective lifetime of days, if
not hours.
