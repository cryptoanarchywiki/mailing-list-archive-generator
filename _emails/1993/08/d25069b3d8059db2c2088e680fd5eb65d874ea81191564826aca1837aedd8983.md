And it worked... 
I would recommend one change to the handling of cut lines like --ignore-- :
- leave the cut line in the message, just cut the stuff after it
This lets you use one --ignore-- line to chop of any trailers from multiple
remailers, so you don't risk building up a trail.  Getting rid of the 
first one is obviously the most critical, but the rest can also be a risk.

Also, someone has commented that most people who use anonymous remailers
test them by sending a message to themselves before sending it to their
real destination.  If your intended recipient is on the same system
or group of systems that you are, this is a traffic analysis risk...
