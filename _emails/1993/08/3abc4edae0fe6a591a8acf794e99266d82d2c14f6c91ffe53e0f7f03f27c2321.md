Stupid? Watch the flame bait...he merely overstated a touch. The back doors
weren't part of any of the full distributions, it's true, but they
were quite a bit more than proposals. Ken Thompson actually distributed
those back doors via a compiler update, warning of a security problem
and urging all sites to recompile. Most did, which inserted the back doors
into the programs. That's close enough to the original claim.

See the Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie Turing Award Lecture, which goes
into detail about this. The level of sneakiness involved was amazing.
Compilers are the ultimate security breach.
