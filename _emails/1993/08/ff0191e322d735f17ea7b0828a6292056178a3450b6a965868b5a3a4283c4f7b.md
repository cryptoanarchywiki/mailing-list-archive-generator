Cypherpunks --

Looking at the code for doing conventional encryption in PGP, I've come across 
something that doesn't look right. It's with the 10-byte header block that PGP 
adds to the beginning of files -- 8 bytes of random data with the last two 
bytes repeated to use for key verification.

Indicating omissions by "[...]", the code in crypto.c looks like this:

int idea_encryptfile(char *infile, char *outfile, 
	boolean attempt_compression)
{
[...]
	byte ideakey[16];                <------- KEEP AN EYE ON THIS BUFFER
	struct hashedpw *hpw;

[... a call to GetHashedPassPhrase to set the key]


	/* Now compress the plaintext and encrypt it with IDEA... */
	squish_and_idea_file( ideakey, f, g, attempt_compression );

[...]
}


static int squish_and_idea_file(byte *ideakey, FILE *f, FILE *g, 
	boolean attempt_compression)
{

[...]

	idea_file( ideakey, ENCRYPT_IT, t, g, fsize(t) );

[...]
}


static
int idea_file(byte *ideakey, boolean decryp, FILE *f, FILE *g, word32 lenfile)
{	
[...]
#define RAND_PREFIX_LENGTH 8

[...]

	if (!decryp)	/* encrypt-- insert key check bytes */
	{	/* There is a random prefix followed by 2 key check bytes */

		memcpy(textbuf, ideakey+IDEAKEYSIZE, RAND_PREFIX_LENGTH);
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

But ideakey is only a sixteen byte buffer! Looks like we're copying junk from 
the stack here, instead of generating a strong random number to put in the 
prefix...



And now a question for the crypto gurus out there. The reason I came across the 
above is because I'm adding conventional encryption to some Mac code I had 
laying around, and I wanted to support PGP-format files. I had been thinking 
about the problem of verifying decryption keys, and the solution I had come up 
with to use in my code was to MD5 hash the plaintext when I encrypted it, then 
encrypt the hash with the same key and store it in a resource to use as a key 
verification block. When the file is decrypted, so is the verification block, 
and all you have to do to verify the key is MD5 the plaintext again and compare 
the new hash to the original hash. My question is, can anyone think of any 
weaknesses with doing it that way? (I can still support PGP data formats if I 
do...)
