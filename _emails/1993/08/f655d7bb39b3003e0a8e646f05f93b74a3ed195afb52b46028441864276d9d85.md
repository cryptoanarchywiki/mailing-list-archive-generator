Phil Zimmerman is sitting here beside me now (8/29 10:50am).
He was surprised to learn people thought he wanted to do a "press
conference" at Extropaganza.  I guess that was my misunderstanding of
what I heard on the phone. He asked me to find some Bay Area
trade press reporters to talk to about his commercialization of PGP,
at anytime during his CA visit, not necessarily during the party. And
certainly nothing as presumptious as a  "press conference."
