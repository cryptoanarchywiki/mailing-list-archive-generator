Here is an anecdote about the use of cryptography taken
from "The Beauty in the Beasts" an article by Jody Duncan on
page 95 of the magazine "Cinefex". 

 Principal (sic) photography on Jurassic Park wrapped just after 
 the Thanksgiving weekend. In the six months that followed,
 the film was editted, scored, mixed for sound and provided
 with finalized computer graphics dinosaurs. Already on to his
 next project-- Schindler's List-- Speilberg was shooting in 
 Europe throughout most of the postproduction phase, but continued
 to keep his hand in Jurassic Park through an encrypted satellite
 feed from ILM (Industrial Lights and Magic).
