The term "handle", as well as the fact that this person could say anything
even slightly knowledgeable about any computer related subject, points to
him being a hobbyist who frequents BBS's. ("Handle" is pretty much not
used in newsgroups, nor have I run into it on muds, but it is very widely
used in BBS circles.)

Telephone soliciting is generally a minimum wage job, although in high
price sales "professional" salespeople are used who get a commission. Even
if you assume a conspiracy of some sort, there isn't any reason for the
company to make a particular effort to use someone more knowledgeable for
cold calling.

The question about pirating probably arose because it has always been a
very frequent topic of conversation on BBS's. The caller himself might
be a pirate; that would be my first guess.

As for knowing your address, phone companies sell phone books that are
reverse-indexed by address. Companies use these for cold-calling because
they can pick out more affluent neighborhoods and skip e.g. ghetto areas
where a call might be a waste of time or even worse. Generally "taking
great pains" to protect information about your address doesn't guarantee
that you are successful; I've heard that some of these sales-tool phone
books have more information in them than is released to the public in
the usual phone books. Perhaps they cross-reference with mailing lists.

I could believe that there's a backdoor built into home security systems,
if I could figure out how they would make use of it. Sell the info to
organized crime for the purpose of burglary, perhaps? A little paranoid
considering you're talking about AT&T. How would they be able to implement
such a thing and still keep it secret? Or in cahoots with the FBI/CIA/NSA?
Doesn't make sense; if spooks want to get into someone's house, they can
do so in any number of ways, they needn't risk a large scale conspiracy,
which would only pay off on the very small percentage of homes that used
AT&T's system in particular.

And regardless of that, again, even if there's a conspiracy, there's
just no reason to let the phone solicitors in on it. All they need to
do is build a backdoor into the security system and then do everything
else aboveboard. Calling people up and hoping to catch someone in the
admission of being a pirate during a sales pitch is just ludicrous.
