instead of promoting another "magic bullet" (ie electronic democracy),
why dont we just take a stand against the tide of ignorance and violence
that has engulfed us?
new technology handed down from on high will serve only to amplify the 
underlying instabilities unless these are addressed first.  or at least
simultaneously.
of course there are short term profit opportunities in innovation, fortunes
to be made.
but then again no one is safe from the growing instability. just ask Michael
Jordan
no matter how much money u have ur still in the same boat with everyone else
