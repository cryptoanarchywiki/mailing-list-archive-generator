Here's a post that pretty much confirms that Dorothy Denning is
leaning toward schemes that outlaw competitors to Skipjack.

She continues to be the chief "Floater of Trial Balloons" (either
that, or she's awfully prescient) and I would suggest anything she
says about possible bans or restrictions on crypto that competes with
Skipjack be taken very seriously.

I'm trying not to be catty about Prof. Denning (even though I slipped
up a while back and called her "the wicked witch of the East"), but
I'm beginning to think we can automatically replace all occurrences of
her name with "According to a senior Administration official..."

Anyway, here it is:

The August 1993 issue of Security Management (American Society for
Industrial Security) has a one page article on Clipper entitled 
"The Clipper Chip Debate" by Lisa Arbetter.  The article goes over
a few of the issues discussed in this group, and includes the
following :

     She also conclused that getting criminals to use the system
     will be a problem.  As a solution, Denning suggests legislation
     tlat places some constraints on the use of other products.  This
     would force them to come up with their own solutions, costing them
     time and money that they might not be willing to sacrifice, she
     explains.m
