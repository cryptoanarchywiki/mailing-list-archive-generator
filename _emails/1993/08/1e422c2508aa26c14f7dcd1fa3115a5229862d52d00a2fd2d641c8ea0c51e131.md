The indirect remailer <cdodhner@indirect.com> still has some bugs to work
out with the pgp portion of the scripts etc. Therefore the logs and
archive files and debug stuff will remain active until I have time to fix
it, probably in a day or two. I'll be sure to let you all know when it's
as secure as it can be (as secure as anything can be when I don't have
root and somebody else does...)

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
