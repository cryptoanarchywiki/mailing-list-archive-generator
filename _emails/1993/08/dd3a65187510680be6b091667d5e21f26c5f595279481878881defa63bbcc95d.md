I have no idea.  I'm a few days back in my personal email, and just now
skipped ahead to read all the "BBS" messages.  As far as I can tell,
nobody actually forwarded any information about this problem *TO EFF*!

I have gathered all the useful msgs sent to cypherpunks and forwarded
them to Mike Godwin and Shari Steele at EFF.  But in future, guys,
when you want action our of EFF, howabout letting them know?
(eff@eff.org is probably the best place to send such info).
