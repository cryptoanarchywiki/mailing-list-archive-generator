Rumors abound that Cisco routers have a back door; that is when a TCP port is
disabled, it can still be accessed from Cisco's IP number.

I have personally verified this with the sendmail port.

   [Private trapdoors for developers and maintenance folks are remarkably
   common, and in many other cases represent more serious risks than this 
   one.  WarGames was not pulling your leg.  PGN]
