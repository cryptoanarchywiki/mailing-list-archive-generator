This came over our Reuters wire - it looks like the Prodigy message
in question was not a private message, but rather a message
on a public forum (where Prodigy is known to monitor such things.)

I wonder whether this correction is going to get press in the print
media, most of which are not likely to be hip enough to be able to
convey the difference to their readers (who are not necessarily 
likely to know or care).
