Many banks make money on float. Could digital cash
pay interest? I guess the bank could append a date
to the cash and mark up the value when it is "spent",
but that might compromise some of the anonymity. 

I'm sure the bank would volunteer to guard our
anonymity in the strictest sense by not paying
the interest.
