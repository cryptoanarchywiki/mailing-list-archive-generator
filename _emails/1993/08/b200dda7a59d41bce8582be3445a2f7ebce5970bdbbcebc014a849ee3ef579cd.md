Here's why. I can't reply directly to your message, as some gateway on
the way barfs on the ".." in your name. This seems to come and go. This
is probably also what screws up anon.penet.fi.

Another problem is that your address keeps changing. Thus you have
several ID's on anon.penet.fi, some with passwords, some without. Your
message was from m..stirner@f0.n0.z1.fidonet.org, but in your sinature
you claim you are also m..stirner@f28.n125.z1.fidonet.org (or
...!uunet!kumr!shelter!0!0!M..Stirner).
