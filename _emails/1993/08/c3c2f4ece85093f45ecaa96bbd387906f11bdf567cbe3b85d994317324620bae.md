I'm surprised I haven't seen any discussion of this at all. Is anyone
else just a little surprised at this patent? I was using a home banking
system in the early 80s; when did this Online Resources & Communications
Corp. file for their patent?

Does anyone know where I can find more info on this patent? What it
covers, and so forth? Is anyone gearing up to fight this?
