Well...  How much latency does LAPM really add?  Little enough that  
full duplex keystrokes echo back nearly instantly on my connections.   
People talk over satellite links with more delay than that all the  
time.  Since we're not going to get toll quality voice out of the  
vocoders anyway, and the error correcting stuff is especially useful  
for encrypted data streams...  I think V.42 is probably a good idea  
for a cryptophone project.

I'm in favor of getting a minimal version that will run on the lowest  
common denominator hardware first.   (Might have something to do with  
the fact that I just spent a couple hundred dollars on an internal  
V.32bis modem that doesn't do synchronous :^)
