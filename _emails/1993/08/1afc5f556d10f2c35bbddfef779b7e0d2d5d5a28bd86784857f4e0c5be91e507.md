Apparently, a recent Congressional investigation has revealed widespread
misuse of the National Crime Information Center. The most scandalous
case occured when an ex-officer found his ex-girlfriend using the system
and killed her. 

In other cases, the girlfriend of a drug dealer ran all the new recruits
through the system to see if they were undercover agents. In many cases,
private investigators accessed the data for a number of different 
purposes. 

It is interesting to note that all of the access was caused by
insiders (as a previous poster noted ). These are the people 
we're going to trust with the Clipper technology?
