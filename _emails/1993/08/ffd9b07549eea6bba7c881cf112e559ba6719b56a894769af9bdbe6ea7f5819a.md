Naughty, naughty.  You should have a nice all paper UK license obtained 
without ID and a car owned by a New Hampshire-based corporation.  Is it 
rape if you say yes?

"One is not required to own any car (even the one you're driving) a 
driver's license from any jurisdiction on earth is acceptable for 
(automobile) drivers in the US."  Privacy costs so little and means so 
much.  Frissell & Associates.
