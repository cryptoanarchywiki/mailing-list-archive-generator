trust?  you could read the code, starting at about line 550 of crypto.c.
of course, you have to trust your eyes, your editor (if you use one),
and your operating system not to deceive you.  (i think i've carried
this too far.)

that is a big win, in my view, but the random prefix also also helps
defeat chosen plaintext attacks, does it not?
