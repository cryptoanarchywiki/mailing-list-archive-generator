Re your "Time for the long distance providers to extend the use of personal
identification numbers from calling cards to residences? One PIN per
authorized user. This would have saved me from getting the shaft from one
of my recent roomates!" item.   We're going to do this with Community
Dialtone service.  Toll calling is a separate accounting system than the
local part of the bill, and each person who uses the phone can get an
individual account; the person whose name it's in can require roommates to
get their own toll accounts.  This way no one gets stuck holding the bill.
