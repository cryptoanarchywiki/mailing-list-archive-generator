He has threatened more than one person with lawsuits regarding this whole
matter.  I feel it is really in his best interest for this whole discussion
to go away.  Why, I can only speculate...

I've released APS-0.3 to the outside world, because I welcome criticism and
suggestions.  The Wells APS has never been released so far as I know - who
knows what the software does?

I don't monitor ANY of the messages going out through my APS - I'm too damned
busy trying to make a living in the sluggish California economy to worry
about who's posting/emailing what...
