Yeah, but there are >1501 keys on it (last time I checked, which
was about three weeks ago).  And the size seems to be growing pretty
fast.  Remember the "mandatory" draft registration imposed by Carter
in 1980?  I think about two kids were ever busted for not registering,
and they were VERY active and vocal.  The whole draft registration
program was basically ignored, and what was the government going to,
arrest every American male born after 1962?  I think it's important
to get as many keys on the servers as possible, for the same reasons
that encryption itself should be used as widely as possible.
