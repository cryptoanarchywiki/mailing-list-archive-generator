Maybe this is a good service for a key server to perform.

Are there cases where you would want to endorse a key *privately*?
I.e., tell certain people only that you've met someone?

What if you prepare RSA key pairs in advance in your computer's 
(phone's) spare time, then use one per conversation (at least for the 
initializing)?  You would encode your public key with the session 
private key, and a conventional key with your private key, in advance.
That would save time at the start of the conversation (although, to 
decode his keys would take two regular RSA steps.)

Am I wrong, or is Diffie-Helman only useful when you *don't* have
a way of verifying who each other are?
