Looks like the sands of time are running out on my account.  If there is
someone here who can inform me of a service provider for internet access in
Albuquerque, NM, tell me about it.  It's been nice being here and listening to
the discussion, even contributing occasionally.  Hopefully I wasn't too shy or
too mouthy.  See y'all in my next account.

finger me for other contact points.
