Paul,

     I have seen several bounces from the utexas server because there
was no Subject for the posting, you need to put a subject line in the
pasted header like so:

::
Request-Remailing-To: alt-test@utexas.whatever...
Subject: this is a test
Organization: there

[body]

     Good luck, but that's what the error message said, there's nothing
about anonymity in the bounce, though.
