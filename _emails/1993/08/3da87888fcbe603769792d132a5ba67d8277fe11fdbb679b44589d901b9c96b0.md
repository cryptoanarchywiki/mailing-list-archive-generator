Forgive me for furthering this slightly off-topic thread, but Sprint
has been offerring Frame Relay data sevices for quite some time, both
for private wide-area networks and for interconnectivity to the global
internet via SprintLink. Now, Sprint will beat everyone else to the
punch offerring up ATM -

Sprint Takes Lead in ATM Service Race
by Robin Gareiss
 
 
San Francisco -- Four months ahead of schedule, Sprint will announce
this week that its asynchronous transfer mode transmission service is
available immediately, according to industry analysts.
 
The service, to be introduced at the INTEROP 93 August show here, will
be the first ATM service from a major long distance carrier.
 
[....]
 
Sprint plans to announce flexible, user-specific pricing, according to
Jeffrey Held, partner with Ernst & Young's Network Strategies
practice, Vienna, Va. Sprint briefed Held on its announcement last
week.
 
Sprint originally had planned to make its ATM service available in
first-quarter 1994. According to sources, the carrier has been able to
step up its plans because trials have gone more smoothly than
anticipated.
 
[....]
 
Sprint will let users access its ATM-based service via local switched
multimegabit data service or dedicated -T-3 lines, sources said. As
specifications evolve, Sprint also will develop interfaces between its
ATM and frame-relay and SprintLink TCP/IP services, Held said.
