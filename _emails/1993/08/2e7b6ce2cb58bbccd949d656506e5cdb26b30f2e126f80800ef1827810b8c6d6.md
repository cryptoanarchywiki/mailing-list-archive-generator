ATM cards w/pin are *already* bearer instruments.  Likewise credit cards for
ATM transactions and for those credit transactions (small stuff) where other
ID is not checked.

Most people use cash instead of credit cards.  Something like 60-75% of in 
person transactions are still in cash.  Many of the balance are via checks.
40% of the population still has no plastic and 20% don't even have checking
accounts.

Sorry for any problems.  Learning to use Helldiver packets.  Anyone know a
Windows reader for Helldiver packets (they are called something else too)?
