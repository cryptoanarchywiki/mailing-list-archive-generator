I found the sticker guy! I'm sending him a letter tonight, I'll keep you
all posted. Who has the "Big Brother Inside(tm)" logo? I can't do .ps
stuff, if anyone wants to send me hardcopy, it goes to
Chris Odhner
14079 North 34th Place
Phoenix, Arizona
85032

Or you could send it directly to the sticker guy...
