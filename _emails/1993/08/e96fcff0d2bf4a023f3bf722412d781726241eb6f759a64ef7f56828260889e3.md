*All* connections to any port can be logged.  And if your site isn't entirely
under your own control, your site can collude with the called site using
the ident protocol to tell the other site the name of the user that the
tcp/ip connection belongs to.  If the other end has a smart SMTP, it
can put this info in the received: headers.

I do stuff like this myself using the LOG_TCP wrappers.
