I was thinking about this just yesterday...

However, rather than rewrite an entire mailer system from scratch, might 
I propose that we ad an extra command to the cypherpunks remailers that
would allow a person to tell the remailer NOT to throw away the the 
header information.

This would allow a person to create an encrypted block to put at 
the top of their message telling the remailer to pass all header
information through to the recipient.

Example:

::
Remailer-Command: Header-Intact

::
Request-Remailing-To: pat@tstc.edu

The user encrypts this whole block and tells the remote user to put this 
at the header of thier reply message.

Example:

== place at the top of your message text and remove this line ==

::
Encrypted: PGP

-----END PGP MESSAGE-----

== place message text below this line and remove this line ==

In effect, a self-addressed envelope.  Half of the functionality
is available in the remailers currently.
