I'm in the process of updating my anonymous server. Up till now, I've relied
on a really brain-dead parsing of the mail headers. This is good enough
essentially all of the time; it may even be good enough all of the time (on
the theory that those addresses it rejects violate de facto standards even if
they don't violate de jure ones).

Nonetheless, if there is a simple *and* correct mail header parser (Internet
and uucp-style), I'd appreciate a pointer to it.

Ya know, I *hate* testing sometimes. Eventually I want to release this thing
but I want a test suite to go with it -- and I think the damned suite will be
bigger than the server!
