Sorry I can't provide an exact pointer, but there's a whole newsgroup about 
it. It *might* be alt.sb.programmer, but I don't actually have a 
soundblaster, and hence didn't pay a lot of attention. A friend of mine has 
done quite a bit of soundblaster programming (more about music generation 
than accepting sound input, tho) and I'll track down the newsgroup name if 
anyone cares.

Soundblaster clones are (I'm certain) available for $50 retail and I think 
I've seen them for $35 wholesale. I can find a reference for the retail 
price, am less sure where I saw the reseller price.

None of my comments here are intended to dissuade Graham's uncle from 
building something useful - I do think it'd be nice to have a public domain 
(or shareware?) design for a hardware device useful in this context. It is 
reinventing the wheel, but if the reinvention is (a) fun to do, and/or (b) 
publicly distributable, it doesn't sound like wasted effort to me.
