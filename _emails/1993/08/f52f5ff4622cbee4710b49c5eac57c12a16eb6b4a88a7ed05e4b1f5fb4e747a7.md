This is crazy.  Is anyone (i.e. corporations) really going to use Skipjack?
Or will they be forced to use it in order to service government/military
contracts that require "Skipjack Security"?

If I had to trust my company's data to an encryption scheme, it would be
one where only I knew the key to decode it, not "five selected people"
(and the rest of government, and any agencies they wished to share my
data with).
