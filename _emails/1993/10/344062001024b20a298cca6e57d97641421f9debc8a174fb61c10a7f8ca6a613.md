There is a patent by a fellow named Walter Anderson on 
a public-key crypto system that uses a similar principle. 
I believe that his patent might even cover the technique
described in your posting about multiplying polynomials
together. 

I wish I had the number, but it came out very recently.
Incidentally, I managed to break early versions of the 
system.
