The text that I typed as an example (not an actual PGP message) does seem to
have many repeating characteristics; I wonder if this affects the generation of
PGP keys? If Matt tends to hit 'sadf' alot, maybe it happens with others as
well. Perhaps random typing is not as random as one might think. Could this be
true for both letters and keystroke time? What would be the consequences of
this for key generation?
