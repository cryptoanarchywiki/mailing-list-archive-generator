        I'm strongly thinking of doing that. However, I think it would be a 
shame if we had to operate the newsgroup and the list in paralell, without 
connections.
        And frankly, I don't think it would be entirely a disadvantage to have 
wider exposure. Sure, we would get some more noise (but we're used to noise by 
now), but we would also get a much larger readership. We would still be 
preaching to the choir, but we would have a "choir" large enough that it would 
no longer be a disadvantage.

        As a compromise solution, perhaps we could have a one-way gateway to a 
general distribution newsgroup, where posts to the list would automatically go 
to the newsgroup as well, but posts to the group would only go to the group 
(unless the person also mailed to the list). The list.cypherpunks group at Msen 
(where my account was before) was set configured like a moderated group, so all 
posts got sent to the list, but there's no reason it _has_ to be that way.
        Really, I think there are ways to solve this so that everyone will get 
what he needs.
