So where's your John Hancock? Put your money where your mouth is.

Anyone is free to delete unsigned messages, and many people do sign thier
messages, but cypherpunks is an informal mailing list. Why require silly
rules like this?

Over on Extropians this is called spontanious order. If you think something
is important, starting doing it, and encourage other people to do it. If
it's really as important as you think it is, it'll spread and become a
dominant meme. If it's useless drivel, it will be ignored.
