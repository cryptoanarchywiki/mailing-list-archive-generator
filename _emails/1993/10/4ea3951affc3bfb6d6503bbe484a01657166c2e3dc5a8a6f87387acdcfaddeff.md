        Richard Stallman will give a talk entitled "Protecting the Freedom to 
Write Software: The new software monopolies, and what we can do about them" on
Wednesday, November 17, from 7pm to 9pm, in Auditorium 3 of the Modern 
Languages Building (MLB).  The MLB is at the corner of E. Washington St. and
Thayer St. on U of M's Central Campus in Ann Arbor.  All are welcome to attend,
and admission is free.
        Stallman is one of the founders of the League for Programming Freedom,
an organization whose goal is to protect the freedom to write programs. 
Specifically, the League aims to abolish two recently established legal
concepts which it feels restrict programmers' freedom to do their work: 
interface copyright and software patents.  Stallman will speak about how 
interface copyright and software patents originated and why they hurt both 
computer users and programmers.
        In the field of software, Richard Stallman is best known for 
developing the popular Emacs text editor while working at the MIT Artifical 
Intelligence lab between 1971 and 1984.  Today he is working to develop the 
free UNIX-compatible software system known as GNU.  In 1990,  Stallman received
a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship; he also received the 1990 ACM Grace Hopper
Award for his work on Emacs. 
        Stallman's talk is being sponsored by the U of M and Ann Arbor
chapters of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the Wayne State 
University ACM, the Wayne State University CS Department, and the CSE Divison 
of the University of Michigan.  The Association for Computing Machinery was
formed in 1947 as the society for the computing community; its members are
students and professionals interested in all aspects of computing.  For more
