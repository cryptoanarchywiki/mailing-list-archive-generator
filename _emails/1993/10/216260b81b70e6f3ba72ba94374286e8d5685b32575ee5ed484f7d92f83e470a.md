	I am in need of source material, both technical and analytical 
in nature, for a paper I am writing. My topic is a discussion of the 
current data encryption debate within the administration. 
	I am a student at Georgetown University (home of the infamous 
Dorothy Denning) in its National Security Studies Program. This paper 
is for a class on Intelligence and National Security. My goal is to 
try to inform my fellow students about the right to privacy crisis 
going on in the data encryption area. Basically I am looking for any 
references to good articles and books about this topic. They can be 
discussions or very technical, I don't care. So if you know of 
anything that could help, please let me know. 

	Thanks,
	Chris    <szarac@guvax.georgetown.edu>
