I can barely believe *I* am saying this, given my penchant for nibbling on
topics only somewhat near crypt, but IMHO it's time for y'all to take this
elsewhere.

Since it seems to have degenerated into a "is not, is too" exchange between
chrome@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu and rjc@gnu.ai.mit.edu, I suggest you two
continue via email.

And *no* using subliminal ascii....
