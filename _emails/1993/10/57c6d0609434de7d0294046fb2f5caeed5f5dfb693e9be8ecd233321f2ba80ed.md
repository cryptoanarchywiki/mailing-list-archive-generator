Well, Paul Robichaux, actually, that message was not intended
for the list, as you seem to realize. However, given your
message, and the thoughts that it sparked, I guess it wasn't
such a bad thing after all that my lack of sleep caused me
to be careless.

I'd like to know how many people check the signatures at the
end of messages. Maybe whenever there's a questionable one,
or if someone claims that a message seemingly from them
is a spoof.

So, my question is: how do I get people to agree to sign
my key when I don't really exist? Is my net reputation
enough for you?
