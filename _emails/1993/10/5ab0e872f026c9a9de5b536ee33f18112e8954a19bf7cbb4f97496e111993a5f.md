I've done the math, if anyone is interested.  (part of the job here at
a producer of fault tolerant machines.)

BTW, we also have solutions for tolerating death of servers which I should
write up and post one of these days....  It's such second nature here at
Stratus that I don't pay much attention to the fact that not everyone has
seen the various solutions.
