That's a bad definintion.  The name on *my* b.c. is NOT my legal identity.

[2. name one goes by all the time on the net, 3. anonymous]

I fail to see how, under this definition, it differs from category 2.  If
I'd ALWAYS posted under the name George P. Schrader, then that is the
identity that would be ascribed to me.  No one can tell if "Stanton
McCandlish" is my true name either.  None of you actually know that.  I
could be a persona of Shari Steele for all anyone really knows.

I think you are missing a major point, namely that in the future world of
the net, ANYONE can do this.  The entire meaning of "identity" is going to
change, and the meaning of "person" and "you" and "me", even as it is
ALREADY changing.  Read up in Hackers Dictionary, as a small example, of
how Guy L. Steele still is known as gls (his login ID from 15 years ago)
EVEN BY HIS WIFE, in day to day conversation.  People become their online
personae.  If people happen to have more than one, SO WHAT?  It is in
human nature to have multifaceted personalities, and I for one don't see
any real difference between wearing black and being glum one day while
wearing colours and being cheerful the next, and using 2 different online
pseudos.  It may not be CONVENIENT for the reader, but is it really
anyone's business if I am who I say I am, and if someone else that they've
been conversing with is also me?  It is unusual, but it's not evil.  It's
really no more strange that halloween or a masquerade ball.

In the case of forged identities stolen from someone else, yes that could
be a problem, but the problem is not the technology that allows it, but
the ATTITUDE that allows it.  Guns don't kill people, people do.

This is patently false.  I say this on the grounds that in ALL cases of
ALL email, people know that the message can be from anyone.  Period.  End
of story.  If you do not authenticate the message w/a digital sig, and if
the recipient does not verify it, that is NOT the fault of the
technology that makes "pseudospoofing" possible, it is the fault of the
users, if they believe that mail that says it's from X must perforce
necessarily be from X.  If people do NOT know this, it is again not the
fault of the net or of anonymous services, it is the fault of the
clueless.  What you advocate seems strikingly like suggesting that we
eradicate emacs, because someone somewhere might not RTFM and might cry
and whine about not being able to use it right.

You most assuredly cannot confidently attribute any non-signed (and
unverified-by-you) message to any unique person, by the definition of what
email consists of and how it is produced.  Simply the existence of
"pseudospoofing" makes this so.

This also makes no sense to me.  How can one be said to be
"quasi-accountable", particularly since there is no way for you to
acertain that they DO only have one pseudo?  To be accountable, someone or
something must make you account.

Not to mention the rather stale (and, someone would say sooner or later,
racist) psychology at work here.  I don't argue from the "PC" side of
things, but "black and white"?  Come now.  The real world, whether virtual
or otherwise is a very very grey place.  This Tolkienism is simply
impractical.

How is this destructive?  If I see a man on the street, and later that
night go out to a local concert, and am entertained by a "woman" singer that
is actually the man I passed that morning, in drag, what damage has been
done?  Has my life suddenly been shattered, the fabric of society ripped
apart, because I've see the same physical person in 2 outfits, and was
none the wiser?  If I "meet" 2 "individuals" virtually on the net, and
they are the same person, how have I, or the net, been harmed?  Provided
no one is trying to defraud me, what have I lost?  What have you lost? 
And whoever it is behind the multiple idents may actually GAIN, if they
are the sort of person that cannot fully express themselves without
playing a role (which is a signifcant proportion of the people in the world).
Who are YOU to take that away from them?
 
This whole line of argument strongly reminds me of the the one that goes
like this: online communication is a bad thing, because people don't
behave like their true selves, and misrepresent themselves.  We should ban
computer mediated communcation, because it is a heartless sham, a cold
fraudulent falsehood, and will be misused by the schizoprenic and the
sociopathic.

Puh-leeeeze.  I discard this conspiracy theory on the basis that you
accuse them of what you would yourself do: keep people from using the
capability [whether it's true or not is irrelevant].

I take that back, this isn't Tolkienish, it's Lovecraftian.  I would like
to remind you that "evil" is a term from "morals", which are baseless and
have no universality outside the closed group.  If you wish to discuss
whether using pseudonymy in this manner is *ethical* or not, then by all
means please do so.

Yes.

a few years (depends on how you wish to define "the internet".

At my peak, which I am reaching again, about 25 or more; counting
newsgroups, Fido echos, and the like, I follow several 100 online
conferences, again at peak.

Certainly.  Sign up with Netcom as "John Bigboote" and presto.
With UUCP, Fido <-> UUCP gating, or pure Fido or QWK mail, I can generate
as many personae as I wish.

To a large extent, and growing, though probably less than 1% of personae
on the net are fake.

Where are they NOT used?

soc.culture.african, soc.culture.african.american, bit.tech.africana,
rec.music.afro-latin.

To be serious again, who knows?  I think it highly likely.

Certainly.  Not that often, but it comes in handy.

No this is silly.  For one thing, all it takes to veryify in the case of
fraudulent use of another's name or reputation (i.e. posing a non-existent
big-wig at IBM) is a phone call.

> 9. Are you neutral on the capability of `black'/`camouflaged' messages,

I am neutral on it, just as I am neutral on the issue of what anyone does
with any tool or capablility.  When it is attacked however, I am in
support if of (the tool, not the attack).

I think so.  I think it is immediately apparent to anyone that uses this
medium more than casually and for a short time that all is not as it seems
and that forgery of postings is not particularly surprising.

Anything is feasible.  The question is what price will you pay to remove
this capability from the system? (incl. human costs, not just monetary ones.)
No one needs you to protect us from ourselves or eachother.

What is an "internet policy in general"?  I have yet to see such a thing. 
There would appear to be no RFCs on the subject if that is what you mean,
and netiquette doesn't seem to mind, it THAT's what you mean.  I'm not
sure the next questions under section 12 have any relevancy to anything. 
Please define "should".  Who get's to decide what "should" be done?  It
might be better to ask "what is feasible" and "is there any reason NOT to
allow psuedonymity in whatever form it takes, provided one does not step
on the rights of others?"  Thing is I don't think you could stop it,
unless you completely restructured the net, at all levels from the
mail software to the societal structure.

Have none for you, probably because it's a non-issue.

Sorry to seem like I'm going off on you, but I just don't see the reason
in this entire line of rambling and fingerpointing.  There are certainly
more important things to get excited and active about.
