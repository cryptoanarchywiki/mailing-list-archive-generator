A wise mindvox user said recently on the round-table forum:
"If you have nothing to hide and did nothing wrong then you have absolutely
 nothing to lose by keeping quiet"

Having seen many a hacker (and non-hacker) get into trouble over the years,
I'd have to say that Sandy's assesment is correct in the majority of cases.

as for "rolling over--like a bitch in heat-- on your friends and associates"
this too I have seen all too often and many times to little benefit to the
rat who is talking. Dragging other people down with you serves little 
purpose IMHO and is a particularly dispicable and all too common trend among
hackers of recent years.

oh and sandy, I did read the Hacker Crackdown :-)



Let me quote a second recent post:

although no one is asking me, I'll admit that perhaps this message itself
is guilty of the above. And I am on the verge of unsubscribing after a
couple of months being on the list because the daily time requirement to
keep on top of the messages is exceeding an hour. Perhaps splintering the
list into the following 2 main areas is an option: 

1) A fairly lean-bandwidth list containing technical facts, news articles,
bibliographic info, short source code, etc.

2) A more fluffy-content list containing general comments, opinions, flames,
etc.

Subscription to list 2 would probably necessitate subscription to list 1.
But for those who want the meat without the potatoes, subscription to list 1
is all that would be required.

I recall this coming up about a month and a half ago, more calls for
keeping the messages "pertinent" to the cypherpunk agenda. The problem has
only grown worse.
