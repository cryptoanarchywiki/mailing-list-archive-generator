Argh!  I'm using a new mailer that copies *everyone* to the reply field,
which I've noticed only after investigating (prompted by someone's gentle
query).

I'm sending this apology to the list because I'm sensitive to preserving a
high signal-to-noise ration, and I understand that my exchange of attorney
and programmer's jokes with Mike @ EFF should be private mail.  I'll me
more mindful in the future.  Sorry.

Now let me try and make this message add something.  I love the idea of
implementing a digicash system monitored by the list server even though we
haven't finished discussing whether it's play money, or how to charge
exactly.  Getting it up and running and generating usage statistics so we
can see the flow of digicash.

Again, I aplogize for having my private email replies leak onto the list.

      Evil will certainly triumph if good people do nothing at all.
