Several people have inferred or assumed that Eric's suggestion was in
response to this "pseudospoofing" circus.  As I read his original
message, he simply hoped to provide an incentive for the use of
digital signatures, and to encourage the writing of software to make
this easier.  After all, digital signatures don't prevent the
establishment of pseudonyms -- in fact, they indirectly promote it
by preventing "claim-jumping" on an established nym.
