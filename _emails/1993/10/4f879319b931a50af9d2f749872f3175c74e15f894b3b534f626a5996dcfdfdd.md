A problem here.  The SEND system eliminates the risk of database
seizure, and encrypting mail to the remailer eliminates snooping on
incoming mail, but outgoing mail is unprotected.  Anybody watching
net traffic coming out of the TAR can snoop the destination of SEND
requests, and reasonably presume that address to be the owner of the
nym.  This is of course a problem with a penet-style setup too, but
it's something to fix if you want to be "totally anonymous".  

I fairly recently posted a scheme by which a remailer could reduce
this hazard, while retaining the same front end -- which may or may
not be a wise move.  I hesitate to blat the thing to the list again,
but the plan was to use cypherpunks remailers as a back-end delivery
mechanism.  With a given key the nymserver would associate a
pseudonym and a list of delivery points, of which the first living
one would be used.  These could be either normal addresses (backward-
compatible idiot mode), or remailer addresses associated with
(encrypted!) addressing blocks to prepend.  

One thing I didn't address, which needs to be, is how best to handle
testing of the delivery chains.  I think this is a make-or-break
issue for the general usability of this thing.
