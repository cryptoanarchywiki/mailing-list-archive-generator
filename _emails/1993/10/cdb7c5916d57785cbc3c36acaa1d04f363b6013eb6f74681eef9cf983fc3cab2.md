I have been on the list for only 2 months now and I must say I enjoy the
communication. Yes, there is alot of noise that comes thru the list but alot of
it could be eliminated by not CC: to the list and communicating privately with
those who have posted information of interest to you. I find alot of the back
and forth communication annoying. Perhaps, if one notes something of interest 
to them from the list, they should communicate more with those who write them 
and evince interest in that subject and less with the list. I have found that
when I see something I like on the list (it is usually a first posting) and
contact that person directly they are very gracious and glad to help me out.
I'm not particularly technisavvy yet, but when I have asked people directly for
some pointer to information so that I can then go out and learn about it myself
(rather then expecting them to educate me), they respond very positively. Also,
those who do not think that there is a crypto-movement should hope that there
is, otherwise they may soon find themselves outlaws of a much higher level.
This is just my two cents, and sorry for the noise but I've seen a bit too much
negativism posted lately to allow myself to remain silent.
