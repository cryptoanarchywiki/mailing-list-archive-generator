I did more checking. Tcimpidis was arrested in May 1984 when an access code 
was posted to his BBS while he was on vacation. Charges were dropped in 1985 
because there was insufficient evidence to establish that he knew that the 
code was there. One person mentioned in E-mail that Tcimpidis' equipment
was returned to him, albeit in a damaged condition.

Publication of a telephone credit card number is a misdemeanor in California 
if it is done "with the intent that it be used or with knowledge or reason 
to believe it will be used" for toll fraud. CA Penal Code Section 
502.7(1)(c). Publication means (for these purposes) communicating the number
to at least one other person either orally or in writing of any kind.

I'll leave this subject alone now; just wanted to correct earlier mistake 
about Tcimpidis.
