The problem with using a concrete anfd finite source to back
ypour currency is that it is just that...finite.  This causes
many economic problems for the social/economic system founded
on it.  I was barely a pup when the world first discovered this...
er...that is when everyone in the mainstream allowed economists to be heard.
 
Remember the Gold Standard?
