In the interest of saving money (for those of us who have to pay for our 
internet access), please DO NOT post long reference documents, such as 
the 'ASCII version of ECPA' directly to the list.  A much better way to 
get this information out would be to post an anonymous FTP site where 
the document can be obtained.  Would appreciate muchly.
