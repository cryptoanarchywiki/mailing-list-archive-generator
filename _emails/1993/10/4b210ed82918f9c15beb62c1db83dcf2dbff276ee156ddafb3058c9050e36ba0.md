  >[stuff about possible power sources and transmission media]

A television report on 'Beyond 2000' described meteor-bounce radio.  The
technique extends the idea of bouncing radio waves off the ionosphere (for
distance), to bouncing off the atmospheric trails of micro meteors. 
Reported applications are economical (at least run-time economical,
start-up cost was not discussed) weather telemetry stations in remote
areas.  A solar panel provides the power, a small computer is needed to
direct transmission.

I don't know how reliable 'Beyond 2000' is, but they did show both the
alleged transmitters and telemetry stations using them.

This technique may not be feasible in the context you are describing, but
the telemetry application was parallel in that it also comprises many
independent, self-contained transmitters.
