Re. wireless networks that know where you are without making that info
available to anyone incl. net operators:  I think I might have something for
this.  Ericsson wireless PBX; essentially similar to a cellular system.
However, calls within the network are considered "intercom" calls and so the
system's "call detail recorder" won't keep track of them.   Ericsson is way
hot in wireless voice and data networks; and we're their local distributor
for PBX products.  I haven't got prices on hand since we haven't gotten a
request for something like this yet.  However, if anyone's seriously
interested, drop a line via email or phone me at 510-644.8085.
