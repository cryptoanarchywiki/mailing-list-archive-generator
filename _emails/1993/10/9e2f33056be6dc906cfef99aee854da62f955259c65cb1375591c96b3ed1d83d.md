Charles and anyone else who has examples of these "criminal GIF's"
please send copies to a good home

   WhiteBeard 77308D  <pool0@extropia.wimsey.com>

As you might expect from "pool0", this is a pool address; all messages
received at this address are remailed to a "pool" of subscribers,
including WhiteBeard.  Please encrypt your "criminal GIF's" with
public key

Note that the pool0 remailer does NOT attempt to conceal the
identity of the SENDER. If you don't want your own identity
attached to your message or file, send it through a remailer.  Also,
of course, you probably want to encrypt but NOT sign with PGP.

WhiteBeard is also looking for the "politically incorrect" (and
illegal outside the USA) program "Concentration Camp Commander".

WhiteBeard will keep your "criminal GIF's" safely encrypted on
diskettes.  Should your own copies ever be lost or confiscated,
just send WhiteBeard a call for help and he will send your
GIF's (and any others he's collected you might want) to your
anonymous remailer address.

WhiteBeard already has a small collection of "interesting" GIF's
dealing with beastiality and scatological domination. If you want
a free sample, send WhiteBeard a request with an anonymous return
address and pseudonymous public key.

Please feel free to post this announcement to other mailing lists
and newsgroups.
