I uploaded a transcript of NPR's report on the Clipper announcement to 
the list last April if anyone would like a copy.  Dan Charles was the 
reporter and Whit Diffy was interviewed.  It was favorable.

I don't know why right wingers aren't as sympathetic to strong crypto.  I 
used to be one and I am.  Strong crypto protects us against the 
Trilateral Commission and the Bilderbergers.  They can't put the number of 
the beast on us if we use it and crypto is obviously handy for financial 
privacy.

After all would you want the dope smoking lesbian communist dominated 
Justice Department reading *your* mail, financial records, and medical 
records.
