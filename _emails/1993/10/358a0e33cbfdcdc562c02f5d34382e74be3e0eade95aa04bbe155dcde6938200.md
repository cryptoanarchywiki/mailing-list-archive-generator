Lets assume we are using three keys, which I what I meant. Lets say 1
is the time do one encryption. (On a parallel machine, just think of
things as being on a uniprocessor going N times faster.) It would take
2^56*N time to break single DES. My claim is that it should take
(2^56)^3 = 2^56*2^56*2^56 = 2^168.  Your claim, which is that it would
take 2^56*2^112=2^168, which is the same. The only difference is that
I didn't assume piplineing so there is a constant factor different
floating around somewhere.
