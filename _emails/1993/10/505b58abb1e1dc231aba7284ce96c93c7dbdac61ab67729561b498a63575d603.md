Hi,

   I've changed my public key. Anyone who has a copy of my old one and
needs to use it, I can still decrypt stuff using that, but my fingerable
public key, and the one in the keypair I will be encrypting stuff with,
has changed.  So there.

Dwayne.

        PGP public key available. finger me.  be gentle.
