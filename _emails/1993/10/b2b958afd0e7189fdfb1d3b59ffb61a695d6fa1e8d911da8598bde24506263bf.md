This may seem a little excessive, but the only sensible way to use
pgp in environments like yours or prz's (heh heh) is to set yourself
up with your own site at home, either with a dialup SLIP/PPP feed or
a plain and cheap uucp feed.  Both of those options are becoming much
cheaper than they used to be, and you can run suitable software on all
sorts of computers - whatever you're using to dial in to your timeshare
service at the moment would probably do, as long as its not just a dumb
terminal.  DOS, a free unix or linux, Amiga, Atari - they can all handle
at least uucp if not tcp/ip too.  If you don't have suitable hardware,
you can surelu find a 286 dos box with an old 20Mb drive and plain text-
only display secondhand somewhere for $200 or less...  that'll run UUPC
or even KA9Q.

If you care about privacy in your email, you *have* to run it all the
way into your own machine.
