Because of (archaic) formation regulations, *a* Credit Union is restricted
pretty much to a single, distinct geographical region, i.e. Travis County,
Texas. CUs with national field of membership are apparently allowed, but an 
extremely tight associative bond is required (the somewhat scattershot 
associative bonds we hope to use in Austin would never fly on a national 
level.)

There is nothing, however, to prevent multiple CUs from being created,
with similar philosophies, that share software, expertise, etc.
