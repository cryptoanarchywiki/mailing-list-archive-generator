Given that the cypherpunks are limited to text lately, it might
be interesting to convert our mailing list into a version of 
Ted Nelson's Xanadu Hypertext system. He had some plan where people
would pay the author several coins for the priviledge to reading
their text. 

This could have several advantages. 1) People would quit posting
random stuff because they knew that it would dillute their "brand name"
and cause people not to buy their next posting. 2) People would 
have an incentive to contribute to the group because they would
start running out of cash if they didn't say something valuable. 

Of course there are downsides to this. Posters like Sternlight might
find themselves unread. Or neo-Sternlights might be rewarded for the
controversy they generate by attracting high readership. The need to
post or run out of money would discourage low-volume neophiles and
those without hours of idle time to burn.
