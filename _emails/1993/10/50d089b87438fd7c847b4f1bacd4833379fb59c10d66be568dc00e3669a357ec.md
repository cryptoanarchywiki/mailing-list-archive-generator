Don't give this one away:

            A<----------->B     Free Trade - Free Market


Case 2
            A<----------->B     "Fair Trade" - Regulated Market
                   ^
                   |
                   |
                   C - A Government

Case 3 

          -------------------
          | A<----------->B |    Free Trade - Free Market
          -------------------  
            ^      |

We know what to call a political or economic system in which political 
intervention doesn't occur because it has been technologically excluded.  
It is called a free market and a voluntary society (to avoid the "A" 
word).
