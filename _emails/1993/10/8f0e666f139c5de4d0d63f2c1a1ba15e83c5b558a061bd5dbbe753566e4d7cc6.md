Used to be that it was only Usenet that got pestered by children at the
start of every academic year.  Now they're getting wise to mailing lists.
Inevitable, I suppose.

Do the owners of this list have any policy on kicking people off?  Or is it
better to just ignore them, lest, like antibiotic-resistant bacteria, they
learn to disguise themselves more effectively?
