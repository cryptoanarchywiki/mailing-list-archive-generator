Yup.  Actually you don't even need the gernade, you could just store
some thermit in the filing cabinet and then ignite it when necessary. 
It's very stable and very unlikely to ignite by accident.  In fact, just
dropping a burning match on it usually won't ignite it, usually you need
some sort of accelerator to make it explode.  Plus, it's easy to make
(Iron oxide (rust) + aluminum).
