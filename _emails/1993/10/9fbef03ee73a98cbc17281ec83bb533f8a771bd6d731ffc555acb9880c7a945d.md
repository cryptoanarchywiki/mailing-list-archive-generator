What a useful post.  But look again - can you spot the grammar error?
It is underlined.

Perry must mean "it's" as in "it is"; not "its" as in "possessive".

Naturally, using bandwidth to point out spelling error and grammar
mistakes is POINTLESS, and WASTEFUL.  Perhaps a future requirement to
read this list will be: read and understand Emily Post-News
Nettiquette.

The height of irony is a non-anonymous post (with a grammar error)
with a humorous attempt to criticize an anonymous post (with a
spelling error).

I'll comment on Steve Bellovin's post: excellent overall and thought
provoking.  However, he is putting the cart before the horse and
worrying to much about future acceptance.  Technology is neither good
nor evil; progress in crypto-anarchy will grind to halt if the people
involved become overly concerned with future acceptance.

Would we have the phone system of today if AT&T would have waited for
Western Union's blessing?  We'd probably have some warped telegraph
system instead.
