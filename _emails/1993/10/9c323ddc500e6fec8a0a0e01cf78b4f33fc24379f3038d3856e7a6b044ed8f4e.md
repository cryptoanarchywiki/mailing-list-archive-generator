Well, seems some folks took exception to my remarks about the CERT post.
I was simply kidding, and have no problem with CERT warning SysAdmins
about possible hazards.  I  thought it might be humourous to sound
mock-alarmist, in response to some shouting and nay-saying over EFF warning
SysOps about possible hazards.
