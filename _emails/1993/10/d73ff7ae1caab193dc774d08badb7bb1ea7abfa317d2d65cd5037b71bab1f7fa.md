I have to comment. Many on this list believe strongly in privacy. This
implies that no one admits to being a PTB (power that be).

Others are anarchists and don't believe in PTB. And occasional person wants
to be in charge of the anarchy movement.

Options include:
1. get a rational mail reader (nupop, eudora, etc.) and a rational vendor
  (netcom, digex, world, well, etc.) and read at your leisure.
2. convert it locally to a local newgroup. then use rn, tin, etc. with kill
   files.
3. unsubscribe.
4. alternate plan X.

I have no problem with the volume. The S/N ratio could be better, but so
could my bank account.
