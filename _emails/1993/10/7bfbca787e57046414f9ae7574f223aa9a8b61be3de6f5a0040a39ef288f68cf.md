It was one of the main reasons *I* signed up... we were working on
a TV show about cyberspace, and Paco Nathan explained public key
encryption, digital money, and nyms with reputations in his inimitably
cheerful and energetic fashion for our cameras.

The part he was most excited about (a part that still fascinates
me no end) is the possibility of spawning new identities that
can acquire reputations, property, prestige, ignominity, whatever,
without the need to appeal to a government bureaucracy for validation.

Furthermore, the whole notion that there is some kind of implied contract 
when you join a free mailing list completely absurd, second only to your 
notion that we are all pushing for the same political agenda (or should
be) because we put our names in the same hat at toad.com. It just ain't so,
and no amount of wishing will make it so.

And, to cap it all off, I have had more external validation of the 
physical existence of the key members of *this* data space than any 
other international data space I participate in; in addition to 
numerous pictures, I've met a number of the folks, who have, in turn,
met a number of the folks... cypherpunks is one of the meetingest
mailing lists I've ever seen or heard of.

Doug

PS: the show never got edited, because Steve and I decided to set up 
io.com.
