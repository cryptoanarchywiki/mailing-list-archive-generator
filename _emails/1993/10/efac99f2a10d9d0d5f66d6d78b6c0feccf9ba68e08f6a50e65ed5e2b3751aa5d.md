Sure, the masses wouldn't do it, but how many are needed?
How many users are thereb on the net, compared to how many sites?
All it would take is a dozen or so people in each city, and itt could 
be done. Don't know about intercity stuff, though.

A friend of mine is putting together some ideas regarding what he calls
'punknet', using a bundle of small, solar-powered relays, maybe microwave
links, or infra-red, or short-distance packet radio, whcih could
be manufactured in bulk and stuck all over a city, disguised as bits of
construction, ettc, so tthey would be hard to see, acting as switching devices
so that we could have a completely open and untraceable network within a city.

Serves me right for not reading through the message first. Yes, this is what
my friend was thinking of.
