"The long-term strategy for health care information envisions creation of 
a Point-of-Service information system that brings valuable information to 
consumers, health providers, payers and policymakers." [the FBI, the NSA, 
the DIA, the CIA, Janet, Donna, Chelsea, Socks in real time]

The President's Health Security Plan -- Page 127

No smartcard initially.  They start with cards "much like ATM cards".  The 
"unique identifier" may be the SS# or it may be another number (they 
haven't decided yet but not to worry because it will be illegal (or at

This is a continueing cypherpunks issue because it means we have to finish 
our deployment before January 1, 1997.  That should be plenty of time.

Today's messages:  THE COW IS LAME, THE COW IS LAME.  THE BALD MAN ATE 
CHILI, THE BALD MAN ATE CHILI.  THE CORN RIPENED EARLY THIS YEAR, THE CORN 
RIPENED EARLY THIS YEAR.  And now back to our regular program already in 
progress...
