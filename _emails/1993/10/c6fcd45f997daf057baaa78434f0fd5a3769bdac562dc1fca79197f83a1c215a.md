## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}From: jrk@sys.uea.ac.uk (Richard Kennaway)
Date: Thu, 7 Oct 93 02:49:19 PDT
To: cypherpunks@toad.com
Subject: MacPGP 2.3 sources
Message-ID: <14687.9310070951@s5.sys.uea.ac.uk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


According to the ftp log, 10 people have so far obtained copies of the
MacPGP 2.3 source that I offered.  Unfortunately, a local problem
unconnected with ftp brought all processes on my machine to a halt at the
weekend, and no further sessions were possible until I cleared the fault
this morning.

Connected with the fault, if anyone knows of the domain name or whereabouts
of the machine with IP number 179.135.226.153, I would be most interested
in contacting its manager.

I'm back from my travels a day earlier than I expected, but I'll leave the
PGP stuff available until I said I would, i.e. 8:00 GMT Friday 8.
