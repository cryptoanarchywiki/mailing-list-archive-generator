Hi all.

I'm playing with procmail and trying to get it to automate many of the pgp-
related email operations.  I have it set up now, so that it validates all pgp-
signed email that I receive.  It will also automatically add any pgp keys which
are in an incoming message.  My problem, though, seems to that of philosophy.

I also have the capability to check each message to see if pgp was used at all.
If it was not, I could send the sender a one-time-only "advertisement" for pgp.

Also, I could send a one-time-only "thank you" to people who send me email that
is signed/encrypted.

I'm really having difficulty deciding if this is something I want to do.  Please
send me your comments.  Thanx in advance.
