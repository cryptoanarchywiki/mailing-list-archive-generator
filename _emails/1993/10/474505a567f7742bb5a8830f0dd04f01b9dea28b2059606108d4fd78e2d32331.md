Actually, you'd be surprised what is recoverable in the aftermath of
an explosion. Bombs truly are no guarantee of unrecoverability of data,
at least not simple things like dynamite and pipe bombs.

Furthermore, pipe bombs throw shrapnel, and as such are anti-personnel
devices. The goal was to destroy data, not FBI agents. Booby traps that
take lives are considered in court as 1st degree murder.

There are more elegant approaches.
