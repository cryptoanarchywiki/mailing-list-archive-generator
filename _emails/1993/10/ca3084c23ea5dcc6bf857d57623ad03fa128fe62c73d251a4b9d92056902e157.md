Hello, all! 

I assume all of you saw the message about 'cypherpunk mindfucking' today.
It appears to have come from an anonymous mail system (unless S. Boxx is
the name of the sender- but then, that name sounds a lot like the S-box
used in the DES encryption scheme. Call me paranoid, or give me a point
for catching an inside joke.)
 
That said, it seems that the point of the message is that there is a lot
of smoke coming from people who use aliases or anonymous remailer
services to post to the cypherpunks list. Does this posting contribute 
to that problem, or have I missed something?

What the hell ?!? I've either missed something significant (and would 
appreciate enlightenment) or this is a candidate for 'strangest post
of the year'. If 'S. Boxx' really exists and is the author of this 
posting, I apologize- if not, then come out from behind your damn
remailer and quit contributing to the problem. As for monitoring the
list for traitors, go ahead- I post under my own name, and I don't
give a shit what you do with the text. If I was concerned about lurkers
building 'traitor files', I'd encrypt my messages and happily watch you
choke on them.
