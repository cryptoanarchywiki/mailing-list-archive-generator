Several of us down here in Austin, as well as others on the net are working
on various schemes involving the dining cryptographers protocol.  To help
coordinate efforts to put DC networks into operation and to work out some
of the necessary practical details of such an endeavor I have set up a
mailing list for people interested in working on such projects.

If you wish to subscribe to the list, send a message to the address:

listproc@mcfeeley.cc.utexas.edu

And include the line:

subscribe dc-nets [optional Real Name]

in the BODY of the message.  For help on using the list processing software
for subscription services or to get other information send a message with
the BODY consisting of the word "help" or "info" to the listproc address.

The address of the list itself is dc-nets@mcfeeley.cc.utexas.edu
