Doesn't this bring up a fundamental question: when is a file equivalent?
we can easily use MD5 or brik to identify identical files.
But GIFs, and other image files (MPEG, JPEG, TIFF, etc.) are subject to both
lossey compression and stegnagraphic [sic, sorry] coding techniques.
If you change  one pixel of the background, the checksums are different, but
it will still show *porm or whatever to a judge who "knows it when he sees
it."

We can prove statistical insignificance of duplication using strong
hashing functions. Can we find a way to statistically prove "looks like"
on a numerical basis?
