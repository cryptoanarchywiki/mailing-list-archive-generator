Well the one case that comes to mind for me is a friend I knew at a
previous university where I worked. There was a member of the support staff
who was responsible for introducing the net/email to new users (amongst
other things). He had two personas one for dealing with official things and
the other obvoiusly an alias (FoFP) for ranting about the government etc.
However new users still regualarly reported this alias to Mike (in his
official role) for bringing the university in to disrepute. I'm fairly sure
he owned up to them at this point :-).  However I'd contend that it was
important for him to distinguish official posts from unofficial posts more
strongly than just by sticking a disclaimer on the end of unoficial
messages - since who really reads them anyway.
