That which can never be enforced should not be prohibited.

The claim that a person should have only one pseudonym per forum
indicates profound misunderstanding.  If someone wants to have
multiple cryptographically protected pseudonyms, they will be able to;
that is one of the main goals of cypherpunks software.

The situations you despise will occur.  This is reality.  Change your
own psychology or change your own software.  You will not be able to
change the other person.
