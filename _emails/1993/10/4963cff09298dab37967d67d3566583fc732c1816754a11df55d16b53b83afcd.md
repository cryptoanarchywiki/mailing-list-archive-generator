I haven't been following this thread very closely, but I do want to
point out some serious errors in Perry's previous paragraph.  Hashing
can indeed be a substitute for storing the actual value of the thing
being hashed, and it can often be used to reduce storage requirements.
I'm not sure if it can be used in the case of a meet in the middle
attack on double DES encryption; I'll have to leave the answer to that
question up to those that are following this thread.

I have used hashing in ways other than for *FINDING* the underlying
object.  Often, I don't need to know the correct answer to a question
with 100% confidence.  When I'm satisfied with an algorithm that gives
the correct answer 99.999999999999999995% of the time I can use a good
64 bit hash as a surrogate for the actual value that may be too costly
to store, compare, look up, or compute.  The use of a message digest,
like MD5, to insure message integrity is an example of this kind of
"hashing".  Other uses include keeping a short (say 32 bit) hash value
in memory for every record stored in secondary storage.  This allows
very fast lookups that return negative answers, if the hash value
isn't found there is no need to examine the values stored in secondary
storage.  For a large class of problems one expects not to find an
entry for the record at all for most lookups. (Knuth uses the example
of a hyphenation dictionary that stores exceptions to some hyphenation
algorithm.  Before applying the general algorithm consult the
in-memory table to see if the word being hyphenated might even appear
in the exception dictionary; there is no need to search the exception
dictionary if it contains no words with the same hash value as the
word being hyphenated.  An example more appropriate for this group
might be detecting replay attempts.  One doesn't expect replay attacks
to happen so the algorithm should be performance optimized with this
in mind.)  Finally, there are times when space-time kinds of
trade-offs are being made in the design of an algorithm where hashing
can be used.  For example, if computing some value takes too long it
may be possible to pre-compute it or cache previous computations of
the value.  Techniques like this are easy to apply and are frequently
used, but there are times when it is infeasible to store all of the
values one would like to for space or even security reasons.  Instead
one can store a hash of each value (presumably, the hash is smaller
than the value like a 32 bit hash instead of a 64 byte value) and only
bother to recompute the value when a matching hash indicates a high
likelyhood that it will be useful to compute the value and check for
an actual match.

The discussion on this thread doesn't seem to warrant statements like
this.  I've had the pleasure of working with some of the world's most
talented computer scientists over the years, and I simply can't
imagine one of them using a statement like this in the context of this
topic thread.  Statements like this are cute and impress me with the
cleverness and humor of the author, but in writing they are so easy to
misinterpret.  In my opinion, they are best saved for use in social
situations where some friendly kidding is going on, not mail groups
where people are simply asking for help in understanding a subject
they are unfamiliar with.
