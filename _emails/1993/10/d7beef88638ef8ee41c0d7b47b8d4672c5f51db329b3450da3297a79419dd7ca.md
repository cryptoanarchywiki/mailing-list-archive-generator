The only way to communicate reliably over the serial port in Windows is 
to upgrade the UART in your serial port to a 16550AFN or equivalent. The 
standard UART (16450 in AT class machines) has no buffer and suffers from 
frequent dropouts due to data overwrite on receive. If you can't do that, 
then an error correcting protocol such as SLIP or PPP is required.
