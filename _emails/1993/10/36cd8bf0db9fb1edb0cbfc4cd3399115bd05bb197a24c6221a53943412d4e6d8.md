Simple.  Wire yourself up a peripheral bus card (ISA for PCs or NuBus for
Macs) that contains a software/interrupt triggered relay.  That relay is
wired to a stick of dynamite, an electric match (available in hobby
rocketry stores), and a 9v battery all glued to the peripheral bus card.
If a stick of dynamite is not available, you may use a pipe bomb filled
with flash powder from emptied m-80's.  Then write yourself a boot-up
password program that will trigger the bomb if the wrong password is
entered.  A 10" pipe bomb should make any PC or Mac quite useless in a
matter of microseconds.  For added effect, the pipe bomb may be strapped
to the underside of the hard disk in your computer to make sure that data
recovery is out of the question.
