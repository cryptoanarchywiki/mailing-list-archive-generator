There's always a danger in diagnosing when one isn't an expert
(especially when the experts tend to confuse *themselves*) but I
think of myself as a well informed layman and, as such am going to
comment on this.

Detweiler is not likely schizophrenic anything. That's a rather
different thing than he's appeared. Nor is he a borderline
personality, which is also a specific diagnosis. On the evidence
he is a paranoid personality or paranoid psychotic.

The reason I'm writing is to point out two things: paranoids are
rarely cured, only controlled, and they can be physically
dangerous. It is entirely possible that he means those death
threats.
