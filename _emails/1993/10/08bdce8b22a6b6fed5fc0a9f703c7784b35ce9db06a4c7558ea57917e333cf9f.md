Here is a form letter I send to people who send sub/unsub messages to
mailing lists.  This explains how to do it properly.

Hi.

Please do not send subscribe or unsubscribe messages to the list.
That is what the -request list is for, so you can inform the maintainers
of the list.  When you send to large mailing lists with sub and unsub
requests, you just increase the bandwidth used, and annoy a lot of
people, since almost everyone on the list has absolutely no power
with maintaining the list.

Please remember that the Internet is not made up of listservs, and
the Internet Approved method of sending requests is to send to 
listname-request.  I suggest you read RFC's 1325 and 1396, as well as
FYI 17 about mailing lists...

Thank you for your time.

-derek
