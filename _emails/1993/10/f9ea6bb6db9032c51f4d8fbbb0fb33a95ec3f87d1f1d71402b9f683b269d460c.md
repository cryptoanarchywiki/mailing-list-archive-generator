Permanent Tourists are outside US jurisdiction.  You could grab a very few 
but only a few.  You couldn't affect the non-US persons earning their 
dough on the nets at all.  That's the point of the nets that "foreigners" 
can be Americans and Americans can be "foreigners" without any loss of 
income.  Once developed, the ability to work from anywhere to anywhere is 
powerful.  It makes one much harder to control.  Consider, small 
cash-intensive businesses located *in* the US report less than half of 
their income to the government (according to IRS studies).  That is among 
people completely subject to US jurisdiction.

Actually, such problems are rare in the OECD countries.  Most enforcement 
here is indirect.  People obey because of fear not direct application of 
force.  Reduce the fear and you reduce the obedience.  The threat we 
represent is a bit to abstract to sell the government on an all-out 
campaign against us that would be difficult and expensive.  I don't think 
the Feds would "go to the mattresses" to fight us.

If the KGB and the Stasi couldn't prevail against the winds of 
institutional "rightsizing", what chance does one aging dyke have?
