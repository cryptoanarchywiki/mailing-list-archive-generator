No, I won't say it was silly, useless, or damaging.

EFF is just sending out some free legal advice, neither demanding
removal of these files nor threating SYSOPS in any way. The EFF didn't
make decided the files were obscene (actually, I'm not sure anybody
has...and of course my view, which may be L.D. was thinking of, is
that no files, no images can be called obscene).

I don't have to support the obscenity laws to realize that EFF is
doing SYSOPS a favor by notifying them that certain files are very
likey to be treated as obscene (and subjecting their boards to
seizure, a la several recent cases, including one near me).

Do I hear any volunteers to become a test case?
