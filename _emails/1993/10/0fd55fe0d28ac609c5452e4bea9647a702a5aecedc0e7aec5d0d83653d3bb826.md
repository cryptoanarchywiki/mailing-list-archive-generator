Of course there would need to be some mechanism associated with
letting new people into the system. In the real world, the parents
and to some extent the government bear the responsiblity to bring
up the young and provide for them. Perhaps some form of welfare
could be instituted without offending the strict libertarians?
Each month, the smartest and wittiest would be taxed and their
success redistributed to the new and the epistolarily challenged.

Ack... I don't know if digital money is such a great idea. A worl
d without it seems so free.
