Cypherpunks,

Pseudonyms are an everyday occurrence. The net just takes these things a
step further. At present, this is a quantitative, not necessarily
qualitative, distinction.

Many of us have nicknames; some easily derived from True Names (Jim from
James) others not so easily derived (Peggy from Margaret).

Many athletes have field nicknames, often which change every season, that
enable person to person communication on the field of play due to
familiarity of calling voice and nym. Opponents (often last year's former
teammates) don't know the nym and their chatter used to spoof ("Jamie, on
your right!) when the ball is actually on your left is easily filtered.

Performers often use nyms because they have a certain cachet: Rock Hudson,
Englebert Humperdink, Elton John. Writers use pen names.

Reputations are built around some of these names. Communication immediacy
works in other instances. And, pseudonymity allows others to go into malls
without being mobbed (e.g., well known radio personalities). 

Three cheers for Zachary Fox and the First Extropian Squirrel.  Nyms are
part of day to day discourse.
