No, I'm not. I *am* assuming disk, obviously, since I quoted $1000 per
gigabyte, which is disk price range, not RAM.

Untrue. The disks will be used in a predictably serial fashion, and therefore
read-ahead can be arranged such that everything is in RAM by the time
the algorithm is ready to use it, so the whole thing runs at RAM speeds.

It's true I didn't factor in the cost of the systems, but that doesn't
give more than a factor of 2 to 5 in cost (depending on assumptions about
the precise kind of pc clone used), where you seem to have come up
with a factor of 100.

Skip the sarcasm and pick a different quantity discount. If you don't
like my 90% discount for quantity 1 million disk drives, pick another
one. There is always some discount for quantity, and this is just a back
of the envelope estimate, so I don't care much what you pick. 0% discount
leaves the estimate in the region of $10 billion...that's still not
inconceivable, merely expensive.

That was my only point, that this *could* be done, and I've proven that,
despite your misunderstandings.
