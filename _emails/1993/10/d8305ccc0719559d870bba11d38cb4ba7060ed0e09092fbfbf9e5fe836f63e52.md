There is no such thing as real random numbers implemented purely in software.
The best you can do in pure software is a cryptographically strong
pseudorandom number sequence, started at a random point -- like continually
feeding the output of DES back to its input.

Try compressing the file with PKZIP & see if it gets smaller.  If it does, it
flunks.  If it doesn't, it may still have some patterns to it.

Not bad, but be sure to compress the output to remove the regular patterns of
the surf, etc, then use the compressed output -- after stripping off any
headers applied by the encryption program.
