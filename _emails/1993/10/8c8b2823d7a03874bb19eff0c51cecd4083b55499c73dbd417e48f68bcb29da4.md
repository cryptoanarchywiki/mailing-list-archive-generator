Well, I'm glad to hear that use of color copiers isn't highly restricted, 
although there seems to be a good amount of misinformation (probably 
intentional from the SS).  

This is an example of a technology that cannot be controlled so the
government uses warnings and threats.  Similarly, (non-escrow) crypto 
could end up like this:  penalties could be applied if it is used
for illegal activity.  If such a law were proposed, it would be difficult
to oppose it on the basis of freedom of expression.
