I agree with this 100%.

The interesting fact is, a lot of commercial programs rely on security
through obscurity. Often, anyone who takes the time to disassemble
the interesting routines, can crack the encryption.

Yes it is stupid. But, a lot of people and companies rely on 
"security through obscurity" to protect their applications/data. 

Part of this is due to export restrictions, but a large part is just
due to lack of awareness.

One of my favorite applications has embedded in its license
agreement:

"...nor shall the Licensee attempt to decrypt
any Passwords that may enable the Software's functionality..."

This is not a substitute for real security.
