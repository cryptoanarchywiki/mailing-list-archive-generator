I have been poking around in Metaverse this last week, (under the handle of
"PlasticBeethoven"). I think you are very right about this. They have a
whole area reserved for *REAL* business, called Freegate. WIRED, EFF,
Fringeware, BoingBoing, and of courese Steve Jackson Games all have virtual
offices there. In most cases the offices are just shadows of what they
could be. I'm also considering setting up an office there (details may
follow once I get it set up).

A hobby store has also set up shop, and will allow you to order from them.
Billing, alas, is done the old fashioned way.

I've noted, that there seems to be a vague interest in dealing with these
issues, if it does not represent a tremendous investment of time for them.

Also note that Doug Barnes (metaverse: CoffeeMan) and Lloyd Blankenship
(metaverse: Mentor), who are both "Wizards", also frequent this list. They
are also the very same Austin-Cypherpunks featured in the "Bank of the
Internet" thread about Internet Credit Unions. Looks like a possible
convergence.

Well they already have credit card numbers for most of they're users, they
could do something like Compuserve's MALL and just set up a system were
they bill through connect fees. (At least that's how I thought CI$'s system
worked. I haven't used it much.)

State banking regulations might prohibit the creation of a bank in the
metaverse, if thier customers are all over the world.

My $.02, as citizen of the Metaverse.
