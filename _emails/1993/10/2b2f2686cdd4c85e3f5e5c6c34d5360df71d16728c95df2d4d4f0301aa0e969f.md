No, what CERT did was to illegally reveal a technique developed by law
enforcement, for the "LEAF" field (Law Enforcement Audio Field):

This was all built-in to SunOS as part of the "Voice Escrow System."
RCA developed the special "Nipper" chip for the audio portion, DEC
handle the file transfer part with the "Pipper" chip, The Navy did
their part with the "Flipper" chip, and the whole thing was overseen
oby the Reagan Administration as the "Gipper Program."

Currently the "Data Superhighway" version is being supervised by Al
Gore and his wife, hence the "Tipper" chip.
