Scott, I'm not sure what you mean by dissemination of information not
being ergodic -- could you please elaborate.  Well, not elaborate,
because your style is already quite elaborate, and I can't make heads
or tails out of your note.  The comparison of Email forgery to rape
("or any other invasion of privacy" -- excuse me, but forcibly shoving
your penis into my vagina is not an invasion of my privacy, it is a
violent crime on my body, for which you will pay) so enrages me, it
makes calm discussion impossible.
