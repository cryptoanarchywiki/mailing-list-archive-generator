Your presentation is interesting, but I believe your conclusion is based
upon a majority sharing your beliefs.  You are in good company.  The
architect of our country, Thomas Jefferson, based his plans on an informed
and educated citizenry.  What we have, however, is a poorly-educated,
easily-swayed populace that considers TV Guide a magazine, makes Married
With Children a hit, and only voted Ronald Raygun / George Bush out of
office only because they saw all their jobs dissapearing (and not even then
understanding it's because of unrestrained spending).
