It doesn't have to be random. You could have a neural network style
translation of sentences. You would train the network by having a known
pre-written sentence as output, and a sentence with the same meaning, but
with your personal syntactic style. It would also be possible to do lexical
or paragraphical translation.

With this scheme, you can have as many writing styles as you want (e.g. one
for each poster). If you want to look like Shakespeare, just train the
network with a couple of (pair of) sentences of Hamlet.
