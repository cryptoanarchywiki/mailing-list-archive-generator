It's more than just purloined-letter issues - it's *legal*.
That means that the FCC won't be triangulating around to find and destroy
your transmitters, which is good.  So you're back to threats from
the CIA/DEA/NSA/FBI, pigeons, vandals, etc., and encryption and spread-spectrum
make it a lot easier to avoid problems from frustrated cops.
