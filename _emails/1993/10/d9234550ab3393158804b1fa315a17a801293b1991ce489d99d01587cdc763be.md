What if you were to use a higher number of bits per character than 
ascii?  Then you could use the highest (or lowest) bit for a signature.

This may not be such a good idea for ascii mail, but if there is ever
a real "multi-media" (I _hate_ that term) mail, such as 'ol NeXTmail,
then I can see how it would be easy to squeeze in a signature.
