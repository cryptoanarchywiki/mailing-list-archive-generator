Yes, it does look like there are two possible decryption exponents,
but one is derived from the other and information only known to the
person who can factor n, so it isn't clear to me how this is a big
weakness.  If you pick good factors of n and the primes are large, the
problem is just as infeasible as it was before, and you get ONLY two
decryption exponents.

In fact, if you look on page 92 of "Cryptography; An Introduction to
Data Security" by Seberry and Pieprzyk, you will see that they make it
more explicit than some other texts: they give this as the formula
relating then encryption and decryption exponents:

			 e d = 1 mod gamma(n)

		   where gamma(n) = lcm (p-1, q-1)

So they use the least common multiple of p-1 and q-1.

With good choices of p and q, there will be 2 decryption exponents: d
and (d + phi(n)/gamma(n)).  If you have more than 2 decryption
exponents, you have made poor choices of primes.

Again, to calculate the "spare" key you nee need to know how n factors,
which makes the whole thing moot.

Example with better choices for p and q:

p = 107; q = 167; n = 17869
phi(n) = 106 * 166 = 17596
e = 43

d = 43^-1 mod 17596 = 7775

71^43 mod 17869 = 10073 (the encrypted message)
to decrypt: 10073^7775 mod 17869 = 71.

If you use 

e d = 1 mod gamma(n) 

you get

d = 43^-1 mod 8798 = 7775, which is the same d you got above.  Thus,
the spare key is 7775 + 8798 = 16573, which does work as a decryption
exponent.
