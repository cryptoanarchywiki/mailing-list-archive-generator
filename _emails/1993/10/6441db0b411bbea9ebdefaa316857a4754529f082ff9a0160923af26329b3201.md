Another point: it raises the possibility of an interesting loophole
in the ITAR.  Cryptographic hash functions are exportable, as "systems
for authentication", or something to that effect.  A random-number
generator based on a hash function should be exportable.  After all,

But such an RNG *could* be used for encryption.  If you package and
market it as such, you're asking for trouble.  But packaged as a
library routine in a simulation library?  It's not a fast PRNG, but
it should be pretty good statistically.
