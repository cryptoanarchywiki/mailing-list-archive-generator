I wonder what happened to the fast elliptical encryption (FEE) 

encryption software that NeXT was working on about two years 

ago? I heard that the US authorities took a very dim view of
it and I assume that this was because it was either very fast 

or very strong or both. Pardon my ignorance if this is an old
thread, but I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere for quite some
time and certainly not in the last month since I was on the
cypherpunks mailing list.

Thanks,
