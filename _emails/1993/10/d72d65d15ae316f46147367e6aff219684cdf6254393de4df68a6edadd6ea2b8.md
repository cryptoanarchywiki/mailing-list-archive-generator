My understanding is that IVHS systems are voluntary. Here are
some examples of systems that invade your privacy, and yet
are considered acceptable:

 - phone bill
    an itemized list of every number you called.
 - credit card bill
    Where and how much you spent
 - school records
 - criminal record

All this information is easily obtainable. Do you think that
people will reject a system that saves them a significant portion
of their trip to work each day so that there is no record of
where they drove?

Also, I believe most toll collection systems being built
are on a pre-paid basis, and anonymity is retained unless
there is a violation. In that case, a photograph is taken
of the plate. In Europe, I believe that there are highways
that you can speed on, and then receive a ticket in the mail
when the camera photographs your plate.

Okay, that's the devil's advocate point of view. The argument
of the IVHS proponents. Personally, I believe that IVHS is
receiving enough government funding that it will happen.
Nothing is inevitable, but money talks. To combat the privacy-invading
aspects of IVHS will take a substancial political battle.

Isn't Clinton's proposed Health card a bigger threat than IVHS?

I believe we should concentrate on privacy issues as they
relate to computer systems and cryptography. We are cypherpunks,
not just punks. Those issues are also important, but probably
more related to alt.privacy or some such group.
