I think a man named Tom Tcimpidis was busted in the L.A. area in the early
eighties because of content; if I remember the facts correctly, codes
were posted to his board without his knowledge, and he was convicted for 
illegal possession of long distance access codes. I grepped through early 
copies of Phrack and poked around on the EFF archive, but can't find 
anything relevant; does anyone else remember this? Anyone have access to 
LEXIS/Westlaw?
