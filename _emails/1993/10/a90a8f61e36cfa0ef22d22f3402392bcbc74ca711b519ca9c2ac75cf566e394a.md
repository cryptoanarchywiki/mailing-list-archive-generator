"unknown" doesn't provide anyone with very much reassurance.

Not all versions of UUENCODE start each line with an "M" and there are
other programs similar to UUENCODE that can be used. The synergistic effect
would also be due to the fact that the cracker would be clueless to the fact
that UUENCODE was being used, but only if there is no type of checksum or
compression signature that was being used instead of a spell checker.
 
A spell checker?? This is insane. There has got to be some type of checksum
code that verifies if the text was decrypted properly or not. Crackers can't
possibly be trying keys and word searching for "the" or "and". Where have all
the code writters vanished to?
 
Doesn't the recursive use of DES have a synergistic effect?

My opinion ---> What TotalFuckingBullshit(tm) <---
 
Technology is growing exponentially. Try: "for over 10 year[sic]"
 
Any decent "personal computer" can crack mediocre DES encryptions in a semi
reasonable amount of time. 10 years ago how many people do you think thought
that this would be possible?
 
Is there some type of design flaw that limits RSA keys to 1024 bits??
