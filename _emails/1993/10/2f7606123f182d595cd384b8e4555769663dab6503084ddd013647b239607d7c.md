Well, Dorothy Denning referred to "Larry Detwiler"'s comments on the
ITAR in the latest RISKS, which I don't have handy.  I always thought
it was Lance.

Could there be more than one? Is "tcmay" also posing as one of the L.
Detwilers? Are we being pseudospoofed? Maybe someone should call Dan
Rather.
