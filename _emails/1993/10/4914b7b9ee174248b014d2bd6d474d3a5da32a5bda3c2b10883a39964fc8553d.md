An obvious reason would be that you don't want what you say to be
associated with your truename.  You might be discussing past sexual
abuse, the nefarious behavior of your employer, your relationship
problems, or the finer points of heroin use.  You may say, "Well,
that's just anonymity".  It could work that way, but it may be more
valuable to be able to carry on a discussion under a fixed pseudonym.
Context and continuity are lost if all messages are totally
anonymous.

It might be wise to conduct even relatively innocuous behavior under
a pseudonym, if you're concerned about personal privacy versus a
"dossier society".  Archives of Usenet news will make a great
marketing database some day.
