Punksters,

I'm tired of playing with L. Detweiler's head on the Cypherpunks
list.  Let's up the ante.  I think we (in northern California, at
least) should play with his head in person!  I hereby pledge $20,
and ask for sufficient matching pledges, to buy Lance, Larry or
whatever his REAL name is, a ticket, etc.  to come to our next
meeting.  The offer, though, comes with certain . . . conditions.

To take advantage of this offer, Detweiler must agree first post
a list of Bay Area Cypherpunks he thinks are fictitious.  If we
can't produce those people with "official" IDs, we pay him $100
over his round trip air fare, we put him up in a nice hotel and
we get him laid.  If everyone is "real" we don't pay him squat,
and we get to "pants" him on the lawn in front of Cygnus.

To quote one of my many avatars, "Works for me."

Right, Tim?

>"Right, Sandy!"

Right, Nick?

>"Right you are, Sandy!"

Right, Perry!

>"You're right as rain, Sandy!"

Okay, Alvin?
