* Notice - no name disclosed \emphasis added\ Call me Mr. Literal

or say anything else, if \I\ determine that it is appropriate. I'm not
aware of any non-apology clause on cypherpunks.
 
I had 115 messages waiting for me from the weekend when I got into work
today. The only mail reflector list I belong to is cypherpunks. When we
had QUICKMAIL, the headers were included with the messages. I used to
save headers plus messages into one file, then run a program to strip out
headers for reading. Headers took up half of a daily "mailbag" file.
 
If I just HAD to find out who sent a message, I could browse the unstripped
file and find the origin. But now with MS-MAIL, the X400 internet messages
are all saved as attachments. The Windoze macro I use appends each attachment
to an ASCII text file, then deletes the message, because of network limits.
It works for me, and most users put address trailers on their messages. No
headers are saved from cypherpunks anymore on my system.
 
So the point is, WHO sent this? Was it directed at ME? It is true that I
forward calls for participation in projects, meeting announcements, and
technical information. I try to credit the source. I consider that a
feature, not a bug of my ethical program. You should welcome whatever
publicity I give you. WHAT prompted your (whoever you are) objections? If
it is some personal detail, unrelated to digital privacy and untraceable
cash, I sincerely apologize. Especially if I disclosed something from a
private e-mail exchange (it's possible).
 
Otherwise, I'll fake being sorry to stay on the list. If I get kicked off,
I'll appear as a new subscriber under a pseudonym. Go ahead, make my day.
This, by the way is a problem with anonymity. At least Chaum discusses this
unauthorized duplicate problem with "is-a-person" bureaus.
 
Perhaps you mean something else. "Do not quote my private e-mail to
cypherpunks with my name." Private e-mail to cypherpunks. Maybe you
think messages posted to an international mail reflector are private?
Sometimes I circulate info from cypherpunks printed on paper at libertarian
meetings to get some action on an issue. Like forwarded messages from the
EFF. All messages I post here are global broadcasts, are public domain,
and you're fooling yourself if you think the NSA, Treasury, the CIA,
the press, or anyone else isn't getting everything posted here directly.
 
But I'll humor you if you're that naive.
