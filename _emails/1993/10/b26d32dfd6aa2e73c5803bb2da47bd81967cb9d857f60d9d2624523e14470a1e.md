By whom is accountability going to be required?  How will it (or how
can it) be implemented?  What sort of mechanisms can be expected to
reliably and universally evolve in the decentralized anarchic network
we know today that will make "paying the price" a meaningful concept?

I con't prove you wrong because I cannot understand what you predict.

Explain: is it because of the medium itself or because of the nature
of information that'll be available with multimedia delivery systems?
