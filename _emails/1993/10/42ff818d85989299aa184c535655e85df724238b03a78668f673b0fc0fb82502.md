Actually, a single collusion between two processes could isolate a 
single non-colluding process, if that process was "between" them 
on the graph. One of the hard problems with DC Nets is how to minimize
the need for trust among the members, and how to arrange for net
formation and re-formation in a way that minimizes the ability to
deliberately or systematically partition all of the processes over
a period of time as part of a "fishing expedition" to determine the
source of some perceived-noxious output from the net.

We talked about DC Nets at the Austin cypherpunks meeting, and played
the "Dining Cryptographers Game" (complete with snazzy pieces provided
by yours truly). It was fun, but folks were a little nonplussed about 
the degree of trust required among participants.

I've been looking at this problem as well, Tim, and it doesn't seem to 
me that you have to output a bit at a time. In fact, the DC net machines
should probably be operating on blocks that fit nicely into single IP
packets. Just consider the blocks to be the result of N coin tosses.

One head scratcher I've been considering is whether it would be better
to simulate a token-passing scheme, or to have comparisons broadcast
to all participants. Since in a broadcast scheme, the number of packets
per round generated is n^2, it seems prima facie that token passing would
be faster (it would certainly consume a much smaller % of the net's total
bandwidth), but actually for reasonable n, the accumulated latencies from
a few slow links could very well make the token passing slower. 

Also, I have thought of some ways of dealing with "slacker" processes
or folks who suddenly drop out that work better with a broadcast approach,
but there's probably a way to deal with them in the token-based scheme.

Another issue is whether or not your processes need to elect a "lead" process 
to handle synchronization issues and serve as an arbiter in net formation
and re-formation.
