Has anyone had any luck in getting a sound blaster card to work full duplex?

This would seem to be the first step in getting a workable low cost secure

Also How about a half duplex secure voice link for the internet?  Heck
you could call anyone up if they are logged in and were equipped, crypto
optional.
