Re. wiring two payphone lines together: uh, NO.  From a practical
standpoint, it will probably drop trouble cards at the CO.  From a legal
standpoint, it's theft of service, and especially with red boxes etc.;
again, a dumb place to make your stand in court.  

Again, I want to suggest that the best thing to do is get a group of folks
together to establish a PBX which can be used as a concentrator/diverter.
