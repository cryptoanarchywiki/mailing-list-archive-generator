What gives you the impression that there is *anything* you can do to
prevent it? The BBS seized in the SJG case did not have illegal material
on it.

You can't prevent it. You can minimize the risk of it by destroying any
kiddie porn you find uploaded to your system. Unless the kiddie porn has
been included as part of an electronic communication, it's just a file,
and not covered by ECPA. Nothing in ECPA prevents you from looking at any
GIFs uploaded to your system, but ECPA does prevent your interception or
disclosure of electronic messages that pass through your system if you're
not the intended recipient.

Pulling your system off the net does not eliminate the possibility that it
will be seized. Nothing does.
