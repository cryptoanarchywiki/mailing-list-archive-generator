TETHERLESS ACCESS LTD. ANNOUNCES STRATEGIC ALLIANCES FOR WIRELESS MAN DEPLOYMENT

October 4, 1993, Fremont, California-Tetherless Access, Ltd. (TAL), a leader  in
the  development  of  user-provided  wireless  metropolitan area networks (MAN),
today  announced  the  formation  of  three  separate  strategic  business   and
technology alliances.   The alliances envision the provision of wireless access,
applications development, packet radio hardware development and new services for
wireless connectivity to the worldwide Internet.

TAL has developed a "plug-and-play" interface for the Macintosh platform for the
unlicensed operation  of  packet radio systems.  The systems enable peer-to-peer
wireless connectivity over AppleTalk networks within a  MAN  environment.    The
system software also provides transparent connectivity to TCP/IP networks and to
services available on the worldwide Internet.

User-provided wireless networking allows anyone within range of  another  system
to automatically  make  a  network connection.  This "ad hoc" network means that
each node not only generates its own traffic, but also relays the  transmissions
of nearby  nodes.  Each system owner becomes a "de facto" member of the network.
The system provides a low-cost connectivity  solution  for  community  networks,
libraries,   schools,   businesses,   telecommuters,   and  an  easily  deployed
communications infrastructure for developing countries.   "In  association  with
our strategic alliances we will deploy wireless MANs on a worldwide basis with a
focus on providing access to the Internet" said Dewayne Hendricks, President  of
TAL.

Pandora Systems of  San  Francisco,  CA,  a  software  development  and  network
operations  company, will design Internet-based wireless networking products and
services.  Pandora's principals have  been  involved  in  the  establishment  of
PeaceNet,  GreenNet,  The WELL and have developed numerous Internet applications
including Veronica,  one  of  the  most  popular  and  useful  navigation  tools
available on  the Internet today.  "The Internet and wireless communications are
both experiencing dramatic growth.  The combination of these environments  offer
unparalleled applications development opportunities" said Mark Graham, President
of Pandora Systems.

InterNex Information Services, Inc. of  Menlo  Park,  CA,  a  provider  of  high
bandwidth  connectivity  to the Internet, will provide wireline access points to
the Internet for wireless MANs in major metropolitan areas throughout  the  U.S.
InterNex and TAL will jointly market network services to businesses, educational
institutions, communities and individuals.

Cylink  of  Sunnyvale,  CA,  the  leading  worldwide  supplier   of   commercial
communications  security  products    and       spread spectrum wireless  modems
and  systems, is cooperating in the supplying  of  spread  spectrum  radios  for
deployment in TAL's  MAN  packet   radio  systems on a worldwide basis. Cylink's
founders  are leading  authorities    in    encryption    and    spread spectrum
technologies,    and  the  company  currently  services  customers  in  over  40
countries.

Tetherless   Access,  Ltd.,  based  in  Fremont,  California, is a leader in the
development  and  deployment  of  "plug-and-play"  wireless  metropolitan   area
networks.    The  company's  products  allow  customers  to  achieve  efficient,
low-cost,  flexible, high-quality wireless data communications  in  metropolitan
network environments and to the worldwide Internet.

TETHERLESS ACCESS, LTD. ANNOUNCES NET/MAC PRO WITH SUPPORT FOR POWERTALK
 
October 4, 1993, Fremont, California-Tetherless Access, Ltd. (TAL), a leader  in
the  development  of  user-provided  wireless  metropolitan area networks (MAN),
today announced NET/Mac Pro, a new version  of  its  NET/Mac  Internet  Protocol
application for  packet  radio  environments.    NET/Mac  Pro adds support for a
personal gateway that allows PowerTalk users to exchange mail with SMTP servers
over a  TCP/IP network.  PowerTalk is Apple's new mail and messaging technology,
built in to System 7 Pro.
 
This combination provides convenient  Internet  access  for  Apple(r)  Macintosh(r)
users through wireless Metropolitan Area Networks.  TAL's standard products have
led the way for wireless TCP/IP network access on  the  Macintosh.    Now,  with
System  7  Pro,  this  access  is  simplified  even  more by not having to use a
separate SMTP client program to transfer mail. "The PowerTalk universal  mailbox
and  drag  send  capability  integrated  with our NET/Mac Pro product allows our
users to deploy wireless MANs on a worldwide basis with  a  focus  on  providing
easy  access to the Internet mail services" said Dewayne Hendricks, President of
TAL.
 
TAL has formed strategic alliances with InterNex Information Services, Inc.  of
Menlo  Park,  CA,  Cylink of Sunnyvale, CA and Pandora Systems of San Francisco,
CA. Together the four companies will provide  hardware,  software  and  services
which  can  be used to provide low-cost MAN connectivity solutions for community
networks, libraries, schools, businesses, telecommuters, and an easily  deployed
communications infrastructure  for  developing  countries.  "In association with
our strategic alliances we will deploy wireless MANs on a worldwide basis with a
focus  on providing access to the Internet" said Dewayne Hendricks, President of
TAL.
 
Tetherless Access, Ltd., based in Fremont,  California,  is  a  leader  in  the
development   and  deployment  of  "plug-and-play"  wireless  metropolitan  area
networks.   The  company's  products  allow  customers  to  achieve   efficient,
low-cost,  flexible,  high-quality  wireless data communications in metropolitan
network environments and to the worldwide Internet.
