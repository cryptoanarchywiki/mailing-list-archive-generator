And just what is the point of an encrypted newsgroup?  What key(s) would
you use to encrypt the messages, and why?


I would create a pair of keysets, VCNPoster and VCNReader and have both the
public and private keys accessible via finger.  The outbound news would be
encrypted as if these two nyms were exchanging messages.  It's not a security
thing, it's just that people who won't bother to learn how to use the
technology won't be able to read or post there.  That will be enough
incentive to get another class of folks using it, IMHO.
