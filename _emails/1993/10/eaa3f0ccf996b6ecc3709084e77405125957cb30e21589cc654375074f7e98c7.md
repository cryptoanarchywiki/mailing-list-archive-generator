Scott,
 
  While the timing of the -kg keystrokes is 'more' pseudo-random (heh.) than
is the obviously repititive nature of your first post you do bring up a valid
concern that Im sure someone of the many PRNG people on the list can, and will
answer.
 
  This particularly ties in with the thread coming in from the previous
poster whom refered to the new pgp23a process of -kg.  I would think that
my typing while entering my pass phrase is *definitely* less random than
when I am consciously aware that I am generating a key.  (This very
awareness of course makes the randomness less random, ugh! where is
chaos when you need/want it?)
