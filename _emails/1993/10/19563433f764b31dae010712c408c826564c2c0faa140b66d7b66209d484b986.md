That's also more attractive considering that the U.S. government is
quite capable of demanding the secret of the factorization method and
generally throw their weight around as "justified" by national security...
I'm not generally very paranoid, but I *would* be in a situation like that.
Just about any and all other laws go out the window once they invoke
national security.
