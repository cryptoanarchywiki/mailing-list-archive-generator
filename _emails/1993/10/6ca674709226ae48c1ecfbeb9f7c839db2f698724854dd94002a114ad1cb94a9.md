Right now, it is a complete pain in the ass for me to encrypt or sign
messages using PGP.  The reason is because I have my email account on
one of CSU's unix machines, so I have to do my posting there, while
my PGP stuff lives on my PC in my apartment.  Usually, I check my mail
and read news by calling CSUNet over my modem, but if I want to encrypt,
decrypt, sign or check the signature of a message, I have to zmodem the
message to my machine, log off, decrypt or check the message while
offline (or at least shelled into DOS), type up a reply, manually encrypt
it and finally get back into my term program and zmodem the reply back
up to CSUNet and mail it.  I don't really want to run PGP on CSUNet, since
I don't trust their machines like I trust mine, but I am thinking about
doing that and generating a key which I would be wiling to use for less
secure stuff.  Anyone here have any other suggestions on making encryption
less of a pain?
