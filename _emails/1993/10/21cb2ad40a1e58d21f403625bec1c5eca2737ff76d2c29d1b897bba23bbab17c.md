Well, lets see how many Personal Attacks we can find in this post...

According to rjc@gnu.ai.mit.edu:

Well, that makes 5 out of 5 so far.  Lets see if we can find more!

(just look  at your last message against wondered)

Wow!  We are 5 for 6.  Not bad..... *NOT*

Well, that's two more!

Ya, right.

Final score: 7 out of the 11 sentences in this post were personal attacks.
This means that 63.6% everything you had to say wrt the orignal post was the
same kind of personal attacks you were complaining about..
