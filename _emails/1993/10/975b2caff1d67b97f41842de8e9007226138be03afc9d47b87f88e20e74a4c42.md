Several months ago I uploaded a program I wrote called PGPShell (which is
a DOS front-end for PGP) to Compu$erve's IBMSYS forum.  For most people in
Russia who do not have FTP access or reliable links to the West, CS is their
only way of obtaining PGP or related utilities.

Even though it performs no encryption on its own, PGPShell was soon deleted
from the IBMSYS forum.  I assumed it a mistake, and uploaded it a second 
time.
Same thing.  It has been three times now, and I'm certain that it has been
deleted again; my only hope is that during those brief periods when it was
there, my new-found friends in Russia had a chance to snatch it.

Ironically, while Yeltsin dissolves free speech and authoritarianism returns 

to Russia, Compu$erve has been further trivializing its already 
"top-40"-esque,
politically-correct venture.
