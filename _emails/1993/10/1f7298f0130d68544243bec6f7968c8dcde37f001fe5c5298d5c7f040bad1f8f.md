        Does it strike you as ironic that in this atmosphere where "exporting" 
basically secure products like PGP is illegal, that exporting the tools to 
generate one of the best possible (in the security sense) encryption systems 
known to current technology (better than anything that can be implemented in 
software, anyway) would be _legal_, because it also has ample uses that are 
unrelated to cryptography?
        If only One Time Pad style systems weren't so kludgey, this would 
present the _perfect_ solution to our problems with ITAR and the like. 
Unfortunately, there are some things they can't do. Oh well...
        Please don't bother to tell me that we'd need to physically build 
hardware to generate seeds for the hash functions, because I already know that. 
I didn't say it was entirely practical, just that it was an interesting bit of 
irony.
