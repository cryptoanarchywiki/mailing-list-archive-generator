Punksters,

I've just about had it with posts like Matthew Gream's:

    . . . attempting to play 'smart-ass' to your
    investigators is only going to result in more problems
    for you. Its a non-ideal world, and they definitely have
    the ability to cause you substantial problems.

    . . . I feel it is essential to show them everything
    that they think is there, and convince them (as they
    will not be as competent in cryptographic analysis as
    yourself [at least you hope]) that there is nothing
    hidden.

Didn't any of you appeasers and apologists read and *understand*
HACKER CRACKDOWN?  Once you are the focus of an investigation,
they are already causing you substantial problems.  Cooperation
only gives your tormentors more ammunition.  You are not going
to convince them of anything.  You cannot talk your way out of
anything.  What you can--and will--do is dig yourself in deeper.
After that, you will probably try to get off the hook by rolling
over--like a bitch in heat--on your friends and associates.

The ONLY thing that works is (a) stonewall, stonewall, stonewall
until you get competent legal representation, then (b) do what
your lawyer's says.  Period.

Consider this your wimp wakeup call.
