-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

- From the MacWeek article:

  >validity. To get your own digital signature from RSA, you take a form to
  >a notary public, who verifies your identity, notarizes the information
  >on the form, and then mails the form to RSA.

The form contains your name, address, etc, and a printout of your public key.


  >Based on the notary
  >public's authority to say you are who you claim to be, you eventually
  >receive a disk in the mail with your personal electronic signature.

_Not_.  The disk contains a PEM style certificate, authenticating your
public key.  On your local machine, where you generated your private key,
is a file (your private key) called a signer.  This file is your private
key + software to make it sign things, so the whole thing is a self
contained application -- but it refused to function until you bind it to a
certificate.


  >Your
  >electronic signature has a two-year expiration date, and includes some
  >verification information.

Certificate, not signature, just like RSA has been trying to sell them all
along.


  >If someone wants to make sure your signature
  >is valid, he or she contacts the issuing authority listed in the
  >certificate.

Wrong again.  Validation occurs locally because an entire chain of
certificates is provided in the signature


  >There will be issuing authorities other than RSA. For
  >example, Apple Computer's security department plans to issue signatures
  >to all Apple employees with employee badges."

Not signatures, certificates.

All key generation takes place locally.  RSA does not generate the keys. 
These articles are a woeful misrepresentation by over simplification.  I
will happily provide clarification to the authors if they call me.

If anyone wants, I will demonstrate this software at the next Bay Area
cypherpunks meeting.
