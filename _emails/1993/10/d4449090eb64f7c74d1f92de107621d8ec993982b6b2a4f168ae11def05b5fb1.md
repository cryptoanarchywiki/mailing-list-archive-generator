I'm not advocating it as a replacement for triple-DES.  I was answering
a question.

I have many uses for random numbers and none of them is XOR encryption.

However, I can even see a point for using this for XOR encryption [I prefer
not to call anything using a PRNG One-Time-Pad].  I can see two points,
even:

1.	You might have traffic which operates in very high speed bursts
	(faster than your triple-DES can go) but for which the average
	throughput is well within the speed of your triple-DES.  So, you
	keep your PRNG/DES grinding and building a buffer of bytes to be
	used, then you use them at high speed during the burst.


2.	Knuth's Algorithm M (from someone else) mixes two PRNG streams and
	the result is stronger than either of the two sources.  I haven't
	read the paper he references, so I don't know how much stronger,
	but if there's any strength to be gained, someone might want to use
	it.
