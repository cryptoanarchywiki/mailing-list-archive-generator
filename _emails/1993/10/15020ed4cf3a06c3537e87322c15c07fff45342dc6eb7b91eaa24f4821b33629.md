Indeed, the whole piece was an obvious attempt to "scare" users of
illegal services into compliance, just as we saw some years back when
a lot of folks were "illegally" receiving cable.

Many immmigrant communities (Aremenians, Columbians, etc.) are using
these cellular phones in huge quantities.

What can or will be done?

A kind of "digital postage" of the sort we often discuss here would be
ideal: the various service providers (satellites, relays, etc.) only
carry the signal if payment is attached. With anonymous systems this
would be like using a payphone.

In fact, RSA's Jim Bidzos was intereviewed very briefly...no more than
20 seconds...and he alluded to the RSA products as being ideal. (I
sent him an e-mail message last night asking if he was implying some
form of digital money/postage...most likely not).

Unfortunately, the next topic in the segment was how audio
conversations (what about data?) might have unique voice ID patterns
encoded in them to foil rip-off artists. A voice registry? A scary
notion, and one we should be on the lookout for.

(I don't think it would work, as it would be even more unwieldy and
problematic than key escrow. And easy to alter voices, etc.)
