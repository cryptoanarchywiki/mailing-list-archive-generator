UNSUBSCRIBE ME from this list.  I know this is the "wrong" place to send it,
but I have just spent the past 2 days sorting out 700+ cypherpunks messages
that piled up while i was out of email range.

_ I HAD some sympathy for the ideals of this project when I signed up, but now
I am finding all the bickering and phoney legalese to be too much.
The extensive post from EFF was the last straw.  For God's sake, what purpose
could it serve?  Why not just type in all House debates on Clipper.
Better yet, get an optical character reader and scan them in.  

Believe me, I have no interest in being told "how" I may communicate by the
government.  Thanks for the info and best of luck.  Goodbye.

- Paul
