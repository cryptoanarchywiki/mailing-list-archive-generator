  This is exactly what you don't want to happen, unless of course you
want shoddy protocols and kludges. Most of the govt services on the net
are the worst software I've ever seen including Nasa Spacelink,
Library of Congress Information System, etc

  Translation: $25-50 billion dollars tax increase for the middle class.
FCC and Rep. Markey become King of the Net.

  IRC, MUDs, Usenet, E-mail. Amazingly, people find ways of developing these
things without govt input.

  Regulations on commercial speech, market quotas?

  This is the worst part of the proposal. If this rule is followed, the
NII will never be finished in my lifetime. And you thought congressional
gridlock was bad.

  Government mandated user interface? ugh.

  I really don't see why we need NII at all. We already have internet.
Cable companies are rushing to provide high bandwidth networks for consumers.
NII seems to be nothing more than WelfareNet. Which isn't surpising since
CPSR praises systems like IGC (Econet, PeaceNet, etc) which are much more
expensive than Netcom, Panix, Digex, and provide shoddier service.
