Sorry to waste yet more list bandwidth... but I have seen many meeting
announcements posted on cypherpunks.  I would love to attend a cypherpunks
meeting, but unfortunately, I have seen none within a thousand miles.

So, Albuquerque cypherpunks, such as Mike Diehl, the Mystic Homeboy, and any
others whom I don't know, please email me at this address.  I don't know if
there are enough of us to have an actual meeting, but it would be nice to get
together and talk even if not.

Kragen
p.s. I am subscribed at to1sittler@apsicc.aps.edu.  Please do NOT email me
there.  Use only xentrac@phobos.unm.edu. (Kragen Sittler)
