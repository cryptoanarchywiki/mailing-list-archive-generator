Sure, I'll give it a whirl as soon as my exams are over.

Offhand, it looks like you get five equations in six unknowns, which
is under-specified.  So possibly one parameter can take on any value
(or maybe any odd value), and the rest are then solved in terms of the
fixed variable.  The variable paramter can only take on values less
than P (maybe only odd values under P), the number of unknows is then
2*(nestings) - 1; everything still looks linear.

However, I haven't actually tried yet, so we'll see!

This isn't meant as a flame (in fact, this method is very
interesting), but you've posted two or three methods and declared them
all impossible to break.  Are you yourself trying to break these
schemes?  The very first method posted would have fallen under
scrutiny.

Also, mail any additional info to me directly; I'm behind on list
mail.
