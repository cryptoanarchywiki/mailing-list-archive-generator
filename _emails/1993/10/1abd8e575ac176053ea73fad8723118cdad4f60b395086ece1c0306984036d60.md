A recent article in CompuServe Magazine concerning encryption made 
passing mention of a Nan Atwell of CyberCorp and a product called 
'CyberDesk' which gives users a single windows interface to multiple e-
mail and public information systems and has a seamless hook to third-
party encryption programs of the users choice.  Unfortunately, the 
article failed to include any contact info.  Does anyone know how I can 
contact Nan Atwell or CyberCorp?  An email address would be ideal but a 
vox phone number, a USnail address, or even a (Yuck!) fax number would 
be sincerely appreciated.  Please respond via private email 
(Don_Henson@delphi.com) if you can help me.
