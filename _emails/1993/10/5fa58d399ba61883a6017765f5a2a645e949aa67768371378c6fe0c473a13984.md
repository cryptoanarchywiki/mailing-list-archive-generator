Now, now. Sandy's got a point, John could in fact get zapped by
overly zealous authorities. It may be mildly paranoid to think that they'd
plant evidence on him...the suits only do that if they're *REALLY*
pissed at someone, and even then only sometimes...they're risking their
jobs every time they do that, after all.

Actual conspiracies are comparatively rare, if only because they take a
lot of high level carefully planning and support to execute well. It's
not like John is a key figure in South American politics or something.
:-)

But nonetheless, there's still the chance that they'd get a fixation on
the notion that he was carrying something illicit out of the country
and interfere with his travel in a very unpleasant way.

It wouldn't be the first time such a thing happened purely out of
misplaced zealousness.

As for solutions, the age-old approach is to be a high profile
philanthropic and campaign contributor and elbow-rubber, so that one
has a lot of community support if one gets leaned on. This would be a
private matter for John, though, and not up to us to discuss. I mention
it simply because it *is* a well known partial solution. I actually
don't exactly recommend it, for complicated reasons.

Considering certain recent posts (and considering the Internet at
large, for that matter), I'll still give you points for showing signs
that you paid attention to everything Sandy said and responded to what
he actually said. I wish everyone would do that. ;-)
	Doug
