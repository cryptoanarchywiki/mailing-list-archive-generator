This is another thread only slightly related to cypherpunks.

I find the paranoid reaction to the "Religious Right" strange.  Perhaps
it is based on relying on the establishment media for a picture of it.
Would you rely on such media to give you an accurate picture of what
the government is doing with cryptography or of teh need for gun control?
The media picture of the Religious Right is just as distorted.

The right to encryption and the "right" to abortion don't have the same
basis - encryption kills no one.
