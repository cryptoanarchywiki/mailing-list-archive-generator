I don't know the value of such a survey. I am not inclined
to answer these questions to someone who I don't really know
over a communication system that is inherently untrustworthy.

I agree that this information would be valuable could it be
collected, but I figure since I don't feel like revealing
this information, especially not under my true identity, then
others, (who may even be malicious at times) will be less
likely to.

What is your intention in posting such questions? Do you
really expect to learn anything from the responses?
