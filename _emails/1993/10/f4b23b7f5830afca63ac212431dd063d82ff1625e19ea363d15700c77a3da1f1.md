I write this in the hope that it'll finish off the list/newsgroup
discussion and with the fear that it will make it worse.

"Let the market decide." If you feel that a newsgroup is the right way
to go, then start one. If it offers something valuable to current
cypherpunks subscribers, they'll read it.

Likewise with alternate mailing lists. If you want a crypto-politics
list, start one. If it offers valuable material, people will
subscribe.

Do not presume to dictate to the folks like Eric and Tim who created,
and have since nurtured, this list. Build a better mousetrap, and all
that.

-Paul
