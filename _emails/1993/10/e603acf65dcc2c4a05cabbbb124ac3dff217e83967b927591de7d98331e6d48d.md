Before somebody takes the above tooooo seriously, I'll add
that it would take major work to modify TCP/IP to function
as the second "TCP/IP" layer in the example above. This is
because TCP/IP relies on dialogs between machines/nets
instead of broadcasts (at least at the internetwork level),
so messages should be traceable back to an inter-DC-net
"table", but could not be traced back to a specific host.
