I would have to disagree somewhat with this statement.  I think that there
are a loose set of opinions and goals shared between most of us.  We may
have out paranoids (personally, I always got a kick out of LD's rants...
some of them even put us back "on track" when we were straying (as have
many of Tim's posts)).  Most of us share ideas, mostly relating to wanting
widespread use and acceptance of strong cryptography.  There are many 
differing opinions here, but this reflects the fact that we are not some
kind of genetic experiment gone bad ;-)

Very true.

I agree... Code is good, but one of the most important resources we have
are people who can explain just what it is that we are doing here to the
"outside" world, and to reaise the level of the public's awarness, if not
understanding.

Strangely ironic, we hate what we protect.  I think it's important to note
that there will always be people like S.Boxx out there... lunatic ravings
and patheticly malformed logic.  There are also a great deal of good things
that have come out of the remailers and spoofing (not so much spoofing, but
posts to places like alt.whistlblowing, et al. through the remailers and
anon.penet.fi)  I think that the good outweighs the bad in this instance,
at least.
