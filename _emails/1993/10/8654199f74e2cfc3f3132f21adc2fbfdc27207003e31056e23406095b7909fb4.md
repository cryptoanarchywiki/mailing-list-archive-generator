Situtation:

I assume this is a gray area. But let's say at a meeting of friends
in one state (e.g., Boulder Creek, Ca), we create a Video message, 
digitize it, and sent it to that friend, by uploading into an 
account that I (habs) and the friend (rjc) has joint access to?

Questions:

Is that communications? Is it private? What if the message contains
images that might be considered "adult"?

Would it be different if that file was e-mailed or FTPed rather
than uploaded.


Or, let's say I put in some very public FTP site, but used RSA to
legally encrypt it with my friend's public key? Would it be 
private communications or public?
