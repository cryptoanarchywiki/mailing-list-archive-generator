I just joined this mailing list a couple of days ago (you may remember my  
clue-less subscribe request that I broadcast to the list).  Anyways, I expected  
to lurk for a while, get a feel for the types of conversations that appear, and  
then occasionally post something.  However, I simply must comment on "the Joy  
of Pseudospoofing".

I'll go through it in steps.

I understand what you're talking about and I'm just a newbie.  I would hazard a  
guess that almost everybody on the list understands what you're talking about.   
The thing is,  most people on the list probably don't find "pseudospoofing" to  
be an evil menace.

I generally don't care who authors a message.  I care about the *content* of  
the message.  If the content of the message is interesting, I save it.  It's  
boring, I delete it.  I often don't even look at who sent it.

As a member of a mailing list, I accept the fact that message headers can be  
forged or that people can use multiple nyms for nefarious purposes.  It simply  
doesn't bother me.  There will always be jerks.

I joined this list to acquire a good understanding of cryptographic technology  
and how it might affect the world.  The discussions of the technology will  
stand on their own.  The ideas will either be good ideas, bogus ideas, or  
require further study.  I don't think it is possible for people to use multiple  
nyms to somehow "corrupt" the discussion of the technology.

However, people could use multiple nyms to bias the discussions of the social  
effects of widespread cryptography.  So what.  I have long since abandoned  
using majority opinion as a tool for forming my own opinions.  I form new  
opinions based on the quality of the debates, not the quantity of posts.

I agree that 'deception' is taking place.  Should this be permitted?  To even  
ask this question show that you haven't fully grasped the implications of the  
technology.

This paragraph says it all.  Many of the rules and assumptions that were  
developed for regular social settings (e.g. face-to-face) are not valid for the  
online experience.  This is something you apparently need to come to terms  
with.

What can I say?  I guess I have a higher opinion of the people lurking on this  
list than does L. Detweiler.  To me, this is his strawman:

  *People are gullible and we need to protect them!*

So what's wrong with being perverted?  By the way, who defines perversion these  
days anyways?  THEM, no doubt.

Here we go again with the "multiple posts" mechanism for forming opinions.

Well, perhaps trust is not something that carries over easily to the online  
community.  Ever think of that?  Why do you continue to expect online social  
settings to exactly parallel face-to-face social settings?  They are two  
different types of fruit.  They are not directly comparable.
