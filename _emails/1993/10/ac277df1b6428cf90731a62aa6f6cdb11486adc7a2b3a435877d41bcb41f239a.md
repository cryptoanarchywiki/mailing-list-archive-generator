Although this cross-post is off-topic, I thought perhaps many
of you would find it as humorous as I did. If not,
sorry for the bandwidth.

Interesting that you should apply a product libel case to your own
situation. Are you a product, David? Which manufacturer produced you?

A better precedent, of course, is Gertz v. Robert Welch Inc. David
Sternlight, after having thrust himself into the vortex of public opinion,
will find it hard to avail himself of the protections against reputational
damage that a private citizen has.

My statement falls so clearly within the area of non-actionable speech
that your case would lose on summary judgment. I'd move for sanctions, of
course, since Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as
comparable state rules, sanction the initiation of frivolous lawsuits.
Ask your attorneys how they like Rule 11 sanctions, David. Whoever those
attorneys are, that is.

First, it's not false.

Second, libel law doesn't distinguish between lawyer statements of fact
and non-lawyer statements of fact.

Third, it's not an ad hominem, as that term is used precisely.

Please, please don't dig yourself any deeper. If you like, I can give you
some examples of truly defamatory and non-defamatory statements, so you
can learn the distinction. 

In the meantime, I await the letter from your "attorneys." Nothing would
give me more pleasure than to slamdunk a frivolous libel suit.
