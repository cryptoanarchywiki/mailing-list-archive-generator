  I understand Detweiller's frustration. On another list, someone posted 
as if he/she were William Gibson. That kind of fraud undermines 
confidence on several levels. It attempts to dupe us, and usurps the name 
and reputation of a well-known writer, and sets up an atmosphere of 
suspicion and doubt fatal to any community. 
  How would you like it if someone spoofmailed  to this list under your 
name, then published Nazi slogans and argued for the legalization of rape? 
  What I find odd is the number and  vehemence of posts ON A LIST DEVOTED 
TO ENCRYPTION saying "Hey, it's a  fact of life, accept it" -- even  
dragging out Machiavelli's profoundly  mistaken "if you can't enforce 
it,  don't prohibit it." Of all the groups  on the Internet, I would 
think that  this one would be in a special position to say "put your 
digital John Hancock on your post if you want to to taken seriously."
