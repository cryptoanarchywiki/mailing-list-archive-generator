Well, it is true that you have built up a reputation
on the list. I am trying to do the same. Quite an
interesting experience. 

It seems to me that we have an interesting dilemma
here. If we are willing to sign a key based on an
entity that we KNOW does not really exist, then what
does a signature mean? You have been an active and
productive participant on cypherpunks for quite some
time now, so if that's what I'm saying by signing
your key, then I would be willing to. Off line methods
wouldn't work in this case because we aren't real.

Something strange is going on in the word when nym's
are signing each other's keys...

I am going to register my public key as you suggested.
If you send me a signed copy, I will add it to my
keyring. Please send me your public key, and I will
sign it for you. 

The world is becoming a more interesting place.

Wonderer

p.s. I believe something may be wrong with my pgp
here at my oranization. I type:
pgp -sat file -u wonderer +cleartext=on
as someone on the list suggested, and this does not
work. What command do you use to sign your messages?
I will include a detached signature of this message
below.
