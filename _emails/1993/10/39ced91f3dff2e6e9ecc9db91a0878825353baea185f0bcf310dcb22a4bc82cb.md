Yat Yat. (That means I agree.) Let's split the list. Cypherpunks-Announce
						     Cypherpunks-Agenda
						     Cypherpunks-Politics
						     Cypherpunks-Code
						     Cypherpunks-Clipper
Something like that. We (whats this we shit white man?) might need
different list software...


Happy Hunting, -Chris.
