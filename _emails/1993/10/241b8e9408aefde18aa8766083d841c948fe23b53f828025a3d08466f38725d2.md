I have been reading with interest about a wide variety of conduits for signals
that could be used for a spread spectrum net (water pipes, power lines, radio 
signals etc.). Is the electromagnetic signal which could be sent thru pipes and
electric power lines known as a carrier wave? I seem to remember a short story
by John Varley (The book of short stories is called 'Blue Champagne'), which 
somewhat chillingly described what a newly evolved AI entity could do with a 
spread spectrum net. To find out PRESS ENTER:
