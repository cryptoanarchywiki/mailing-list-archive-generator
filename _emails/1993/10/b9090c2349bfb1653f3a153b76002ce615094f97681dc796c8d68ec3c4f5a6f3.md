   We are Robert J Woodhead of Borg. You will be assimilated. You will adapt
to service us and other borgs. Do not worry about the sacrifices you will 
make for the collective. After you are dead from your life of service, you
can take pleasure in knowing that the collective has survived to enslave
others like you.


   Resistance is futile, brother.


We are Designation 8672, subgroup 3f7
