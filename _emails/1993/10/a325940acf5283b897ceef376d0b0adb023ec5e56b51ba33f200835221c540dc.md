Hello!

     I  read   about   overlooking  of  monitor   radiation.
Introder   can   scan   the  electron-beam  radiation   from
electron-gun. He  simple  transmit  this   radiation to self
electron-gun  and sinchronize  frequance. This  method  work
with b/w  monitor.  The  overlooking of  color-monitor  more
dificult - introder will see 4 gradation of gray  (all  guns
off, work one, two, three guns). But  we can select  spesial
colors (red-blue or blue-green) and  allways will  work only
one (or two) guns. In this way  introder will  see  dark (or
light) gray screen without any information!!!
     Is it  corect?  Do now present more improve overlooking
system?

Some words about DES - I spoke with one cryptoanalisyst from
KGB and he sow, that for number crypto algotitm c(key, text)
(key is keyLength tall) present f(key, text), that for all
key1 and key2 present key with length keyLength, that
c(key2, c(key1, text))==f(key, text).

He also say, that now present f() for c()=des(), more f() wery
like des().

That`s why for decrypting of des(k1, des(k2, ... des(kN, text) ... ))
we must try 2^56 keys with spetial function.
