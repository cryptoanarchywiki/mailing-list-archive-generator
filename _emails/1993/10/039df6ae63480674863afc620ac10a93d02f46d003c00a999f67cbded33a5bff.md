They were the Navajo (or Navaho) code talkers. Kahn's "The
Codebreakers" has a discussion of this, as I recall. Probably the
"Encyclopedia Britannica" will also a mention of it.

These are codes, not ciphers, and are of course not very secure. The
Germans and Japanese in WW II obviously did not have enough time to
find native Navajo speakers, and I suspect few books on that language
were available at that time, hence the scheme was temporarily secure.

Otherwise, forget it.
