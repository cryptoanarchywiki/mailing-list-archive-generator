I'm surprised no one has yet mentioned the *large* 2-part story that
appeared starting yesterday (Sunday October 3) in the LA Times. It
appeared in the top of column 1 on page 1 with the title "Demanding
the Ability to Snoop".  It deals primarily with Clipper, with sidebars
on the FBI Digital Telephony stuff.

Monday's article also appears in column 1 of page 1, but at the
bottom. It is titled "Computer Code's Security Worries Privacy
Watchdogs" and it begins with a quote from Mykotronix's president
commenting on how he felt about the Internet message carrying stuff
found in his garbage. The article is primarily about Mykotronix's
involvement with Clipper.

Inside is a sidebar on Dorothy Denning, complete with photograph
suitable for a dartboard.

It is *really* becoming a challenge to keep up with all the media
coverage lately!

Phil
