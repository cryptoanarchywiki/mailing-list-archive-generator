True.

You get even better entropy if you turn off the mic (or unplug it)
and run the sampled audio output into compress -- assuming your mic
is like mine and lets a bit of electronic noise sneak through every byte
or two.

The fan noise sounds random to us but it's relatively simple, in Fourier
space.  The same applies to fluorescent light noise.  Although it's
simple, it can defeat compress - so you end up with low entropy per byte.
