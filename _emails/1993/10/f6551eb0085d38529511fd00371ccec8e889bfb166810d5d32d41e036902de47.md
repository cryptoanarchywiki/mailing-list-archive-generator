Has anyone considered forwarding and/or send NPR an information packet to
help bring the encryption/clipper issues to the general public, or is that
looked upon as a bad idea?

<--

I'm in favor of getting the word out on the Clipper/Skipjack problem but 
I don't think sending a note to NPR is going to do it.  They have a long 
history of extremely biased (toward the government view) reporting.
