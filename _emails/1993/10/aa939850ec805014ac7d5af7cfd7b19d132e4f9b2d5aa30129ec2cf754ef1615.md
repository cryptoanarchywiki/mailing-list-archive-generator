He's probably right.  (Of course, *most* laws made by the Rich and Powerful
will be used to cement their power base, so this is just a special case....)

Some examples that have been discussed on the net include the British
data privacy laws that limit the personal-information databases that you 
can keep without formal notification to the people contained in them
(and to the government.)  The fact that you've got a computer
and are using it in ways that indicate you have *some* database capability
but haven't registered has been used as an excuse to search people's computers.
Of course, if you *have* registered, then they can search to be sure
you don't have any data you've forgotten to mention....

It's not an uncommon thing to find among people who believe in things
but don't think about the implications of implementing those beliefs, 
as well as with people who are messing with really complicated technology.
