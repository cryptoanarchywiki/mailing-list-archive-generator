No, in point of fact, you're a poorly adjusted infant who finds it amusing
to stand at a safe distance and clog up the net with threats which he
surely would never dare to make face-to-face.

Ray, before you recommend psychological evaluation for others, it might be
worth considering looking into some for yourself.  You might also want to
give Jacoby and Meyers a call and ask them for a quick rundown on the
prevailing assault statutes.

Please take your cowardly bravado to private email.  You're about as
impressive as a third-grader sticking out his tongue at the playground
bully from behind the safety of his mother's skirt, a situation with which
I can't help but feel you have some personal familiarity.
