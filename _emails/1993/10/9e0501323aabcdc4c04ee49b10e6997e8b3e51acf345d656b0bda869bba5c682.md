L.>the Constitution specifically prohibits `high treason'. Or are we now
L.>against the Constitution? It's hard to keep track lately.

Little hint for you traitors out there.  Only citizens can be convicted of 
treason.  If you renounce your citizenship prior to your treasonous acts, 
you're home free.

L.>The cypherpunk `agenda' has become so closely indistinguishable with
L.>raw criminality and evil it horrifies me. [Ted Bundy, etc.]

People whose identities are known have murdered more people than people 
whose identities are unknown.  Janet Reno murdered many more people than 
Ted.

Lot of good arguments against democracy in this post.  We can use the 
moral support.
