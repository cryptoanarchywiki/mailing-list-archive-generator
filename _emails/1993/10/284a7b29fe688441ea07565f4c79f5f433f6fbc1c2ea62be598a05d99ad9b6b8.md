Not even the antenna should be visible.  Remember, for spread spectrum radio
detectable only by the intended receivers (which use the correct spread-spectrum
code for coherent detection), the power density should be hardly distinguishable
from the ambient noise.  One way to arrange this is to put the antenna inside of
a physically secure perimeter, outside of which the power density is too low for
noncoherent detection.  The perimeter can be optically opaque (e.g. a building),
as long as it leaks enough r.f. in the direction of the receiver(s) for coherent
detection.  Preventing noncoherent detection may often require _attenuation_ of
an otherwise too-powerful signal, and the building may serve part of this
function.

Yup.
