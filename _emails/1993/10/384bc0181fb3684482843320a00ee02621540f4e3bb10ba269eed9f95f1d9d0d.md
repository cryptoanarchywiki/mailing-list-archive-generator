Great description!  One question, which struck me when I heard Chaum
present this material at IETF Amsterdam:

What if Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all colluding, and Bob and Charlie
present the same 1's and 0's to Alice?  The bank would know the same
bill was spent twice once it got it, but wouldn't be able to determine
that Alice was the spender.  Bob and Charlie could both claim "What a
cooincidence!"  and say they wanted their money.

I suppose the bank could just write the scenario down, and hand the
money to Bob and Charlie (who give their cut to Alice, in anonymous
digicash, of course).  If it happens again, the bank says "yeah,
right" and invokes the clause in their contract which allows the bank
to terminate its relationship with Bob and Charlie.  Assuming the
digicash economy is strong enough that people won't cut off the
relationship with the bank so easily, most people won't try this.  But
it will cause the bank to want to put an upper limit on transaction
size.
