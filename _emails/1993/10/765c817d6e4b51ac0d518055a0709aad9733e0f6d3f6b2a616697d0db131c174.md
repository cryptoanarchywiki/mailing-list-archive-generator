     New Coalition Unveils Public Interest Blueprint
   for America's 21st Century Telecommunications Highway

Washington, DC -- A new coalition, the Telecommunications
Policy Roundtable, is calling on Americans to make their
voices heard on seven vital issues of communications
policy.   The coalition's goal is the creation of new
approaches to building our nation's emerging information
infrastructure.
        The Telecommunications Policy Roundtable is a
public interest coalition of more than seventy
organizations.  Its statement of principles comes less
than a month after the Clinton administration released
its own blueprint:  "National Information Infrastructure:
Agenda for Action."  The Clinton program envisions a
national network linking computer, telephone and
television technologies.
        The statement also follows dramatic developments in
the telecommunications industry, including the planned
merger of Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications
Incorporated (TCI).
        The statement, entitled "Renewing the Commitment to
a Public Interest Telecommunications Policy," outlines a
series of  principles, and introduces them with this
credo: "We believe that the following principles must
guide policymaking in order to ensure that future
generations inherit an information infrastructure which
enhances the quality of life for everyone."

The seven principles are:

o       Universal access -- In our information age,
everyone has a right to affordable news, education
and government information.  Information that is
essential to the functioning of citizens in a
democracy should be free.

o       Freedom to Communicate -- Information is a two way
street.  The design of the new networks should aid
two-way audio and video communication from anyone
to any individual, group or network.

o       Vital civic sector -- The new networks should allow
all groups and individuals to freely express their
ideas and opinions.  The new networks should
include a way for us to build communities.

o       Diverse and competitive marketplace --  No one
should ever control both the wire or wires into our
home and the content of the programs that go over
those wires.

o       Equitable workplace -- workers must be valued and
protected in the new electronic workplace.
Nondiscriminatory practices must form the core of
the new information marketplace.

o       Privacy protection -- Privacy should be carefully
protected and extended.

o       Democratic policy making -- Every American deserves
to be heard on this complex set of issues.

        The coalition meets monthly in Washington, DC.  A
complete list of member organizations is attached.
