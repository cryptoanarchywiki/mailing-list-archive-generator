Having been an AFSC 30670 (Electronic and Cryptographic Equipment Systems
Technician), and been assigned in hazardous areas you use document destroyers
on paper stuff - glass vials with grenade fuses).  Equipment destroyers
were 35 lb thermite charges, designed to sit on top of a standard piece
of equipment in a 19 inch relay rack.  I had orders to Iran but got diverted
when the Shah fell.  The liquid in the document destroyers was clear, and
we got to set one off for demo purposes twice a year (never did get to
set off thermite, though).  Had a one acre room half filled with crypto,
thermite would have brought the roof and lots of airconditioners down.

All the key cards were treated with lead acetate, they would burn without
leaving anything but a greasy wisp of ash.
