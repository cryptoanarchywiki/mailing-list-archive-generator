[I will make no mention of Detweiler's rants, or the coinage of the 
phrase "to detweil"]

I think that Tim has made a _very_ important point, and several of the
others have made posts supporting it.  If the government is to build a 
National Super-Duper Digital Highway system, they are extremely likely
to feel the "need" to monitor it.  They built the backbones of the 
Internet, and look at the NSA.... reading your email, perhaps?

I had heard that the Gov was going to shell out money, and let 
private industry build it, I don't know if it's true, or not,
but something I really HATE is the abridging of my freedom of speech
(not to mention my feelings on personal privacy)

I think that this is becoming the second large-scale battle we face,
the Clipper/SkipJack/Capstone fiasco being the first.

Lets forget about ravers [detweiler] and move on...  There's battles to 
be one, 'm boys!
