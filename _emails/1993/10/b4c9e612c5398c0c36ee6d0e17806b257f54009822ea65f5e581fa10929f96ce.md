Perry, I think its foolish to refute it simply on a literal basis, 
but then again, that's just lil' ole me. 

One could reasonably argue that you simply can't walk into the
corner 7-Eleven with a pound of gold and purchase 475 Big Gulps (tm),
but then again, there's an advocate for each point of view (ie,
Sternlight).

I personally like the gold/silicon comparison, if taken from a 
philosophical viewpoint. 

Information is arguably the gold of the future, and strong crypto
helps broaden the spectrum for each and every one of us.

Cheers,
