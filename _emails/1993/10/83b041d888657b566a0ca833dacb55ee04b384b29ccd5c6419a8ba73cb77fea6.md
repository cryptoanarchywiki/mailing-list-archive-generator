Just about everything said about common carriers in these postings is
wrong. ECPA is not limited to common carriers, for example. And it *does*
apply to BBSs.

Finally, one doesn't claim common carrier status, absent a legislative or
regulatory grant of that status.

For a brief period, thanks to some partial research I'd done in the
subject, I was under the impression that there is such a thing as a
"common-law common carrier," at least potentially. I now know that this is
not the case.
