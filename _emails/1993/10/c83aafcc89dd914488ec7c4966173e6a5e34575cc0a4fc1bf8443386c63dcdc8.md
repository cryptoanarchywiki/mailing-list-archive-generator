Dug writes that he intentionally strips out all identifying information
from his incoming mail that would show who it is from.  Truly this is
a radical solution to the problem of spoofing.  A basic principle of
discourse is that the validity of an idea is independent of its source
(which is why ad hominem attacks are considered invalid).  Yet this
principle is not widely followed (which is why ad hominem attacks are
considered effective).  Dug's solution enforces the discipline of judging
each piece of mail on its own merits.  Maybe more people should consider
this approach.
