Danger Will Robinson!

The only danger you really face in being revealed through a DC net is when
you are isolated by colluders on the graph.  I know who the people to my
left and right are.  If I am colluding with either one of them and you ask
to join the network I am on I will say "sure...you talk to person X" (my
colluder) and you are now completely screwed.

There are other options for network formation and joining, and I would
recommend against this one...

Remember that on the net "legality" is often a _local_ thing.  With a DC
network consisting of participants from several different countries things
might get very interesting, because it would be imposible to determine who
a message came from and therefore who has jursidiction or even if any law
was broken...
