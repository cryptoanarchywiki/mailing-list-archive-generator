We (ExI) have offered the software now being used to operate
the Extropians list to the operators of the cypherpunks list.

Our software is not quite ready for prime-time, but it is a
solid and interesting program. It allows for kill files by
user, and subject (reg. exp.), and allows for retrival of 
messages by subject (reg. exp.) and full body text (agrep).

It is very modular with one part of the program databasing all
incoming messages and other modules actings as agents for
various list members. Each agent can support one or more
users (subscribers).

In addition to kill files, all messages can be excluded and
then specfic messages can be Included.

I feel it or similar software will solve the programs that 
some members of this list are complaining about. (Mailing
List vs. News Group). 

I strongly urge that a newsgroup NOT be formed.
