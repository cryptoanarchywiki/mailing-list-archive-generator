Gee, Hal, that can't be right.  I've always thought we were a
subversive *dis*organization.

According to my online dictionary:

    subversive
    ========================================
    sub*ver*sive

    adjective
    (1) Intended or serving to subvert, especially intended
    to overthrow or undermine an established government:
    "Sex and creativity are often seen by dictators as
    subversive activities" Source: Erica Jong

Sounds good to me.

Say!  Do you think we could work that sex part in somehow?
("I'll show you mine, if you'll show me yours . . . public key,
that is.")
