Have you seen random dot stereo pictures?  (cross-eye stereo)

There are 5 or 6 repetitions of a seemingly random dot field -- but the
first repetition really is random (I believe).

A friend of a friend has S/W for generating these.  I remember looking
at it once and it's not hard at all.  However, that was years ago.
