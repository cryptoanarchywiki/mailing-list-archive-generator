The following was posted by L. Detweiler as an example of a typical response to his 
cypherpunk postings: -->

>There is no cypherpunks cause.  Neither is there a cypherpunks
>movement.  Get these delusions out of your head.  There is, however,
>cypherpunks software.
>
>I repeat, the cause and movement are in your own head.

<--

If there is no cypherpunks cause or movement, please let me know.  Being 
able to interact with people who believe in the cypherpunks cause is the 
only reason I subscribe to this list and if there is no cause, I would 
like to unsubscribe and spend my time elsewhere.  Can we have a simple 
survey of the list?  If you believe there is a cypherpunks cause and you 
believe in it, please post a short note to that effect to the list.  
Anyone who is interested can keep count.  I suppose to be fair, you 
should also post a note if you believe there is no cause.
