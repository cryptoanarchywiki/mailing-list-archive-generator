Yes, she was being deceptive.  No, she was not being maliciously
deceptive, as her "agentself" was merely doing the same thing that
a seperate agent would have done, being an advocate for the actor.

The difference is that the third party _expects_ the agent to praise
the actor.  In L Detweilers example, the pseudo-spoofer was using
the _lack_ of expectation to his/her advantage.
