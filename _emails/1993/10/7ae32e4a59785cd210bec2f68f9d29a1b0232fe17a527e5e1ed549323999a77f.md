And I think this is a wise thing to do. I comment these folks for
pursuing this, all the more so becuas a "credit union" is not the
sexiest thing I can think of (not compared to data havens at least).
But it'll be the solidly middle class apps like digital credit unions
that wil help further colonized cyberspace (and cypherspace).

Meanwhile, I'm fairly "out" about my crypto preferences, and intend to
continue talking about crypto anarchy. I'm sure you folks wouldn't
want it any other way.

Good luck!
