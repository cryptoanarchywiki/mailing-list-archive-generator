I received the stickers from the printer about 10 minutes ago. It'll take
me a day or three to get them all mailed out. ( they came pre-cut rather
than in sheets like I thought they would; Big orders of 1000 or more are
going to involve some substantial processing time ;)

Happy Hunting, -Chris.

My opinions are shareware. For a registered copy, send me 15$ in DigiCash.
