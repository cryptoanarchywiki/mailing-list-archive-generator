This is a very simple linear congruential generator:
	a_n = a_n-1 + a_n-2	mod 10
It is decidedly *not* suitable for "producing an `acceptable' random
file to be xor'd with the plaintext."  It's not a cryptographically
strong PRNG (it's not even a particularly good PRNG).  To break such
a system, try Boyar's paper, "Inferring Sequences Produced by
PRNGs", in JACM 36(1): 129-141.  I believe it takes time logarithmic
in the modulus, which is not a recipe for security.
