  I recently had a problem with my internet mailbox and I lost some
important posts to the list..ALso, bedcause of lack of time I have had to
drop the net..but I read a post a short while back about somebody
had a bunch of stickers made up of that gif that says Big Brother INside

  Would you email me with the price of the stickers..I'm interested in buying
some... Thankyou

Nick
