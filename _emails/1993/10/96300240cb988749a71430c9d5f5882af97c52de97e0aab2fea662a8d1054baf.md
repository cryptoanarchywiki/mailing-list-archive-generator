The last couple of weeks have been interesting and fun
(and have provided me with useful information upoin
which I will act shortly), but I can't keep up with the
volume.  Thanks, and see you later (when I have more time).
I will remain on the -announce list and will still be
available via direct e-mail.  bye for now...
