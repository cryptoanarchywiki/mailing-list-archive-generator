Maybe a cypherpunk will be interested in this.

BTW - Look at the disclaimer this guy has in his signature. The effect
of this ITAR nonsense is absolutely chilling. He says he has talked to
`the NSA & State Dept.' before he `publishes' to the INTERNET!

I have some other examples of how the Zimmermann-Ward affair is
chilling e.g. current book publishers.

Sorry, header lost in transit.

===cut=here===

To anyone with a technical interest in cryptography:

I am finishing the draft of a paper detailing a new mathematical
approach to cryptography and am looking for a few technical peer
reviewers who would be willing to critique the paper prior its to
publication via the Internet. 

A quick summary:

   - the revised paper will be published via the Internet and the
     mathematical basis, theory and concepts will be _freely_
     available to everyone and may be freely redistributed for non-
     commercial use (ie, non-resale).  (The paper is copyrighted
     and all rights are reserved)

          [see footnote regarding ITAR/export issues]

   - this approach to cryptography is strongly based on physical
     laws, particularly the laws of thermodynamics, to achieve its
     security (instead of the normal approach of relying on "hard"
     number-theoretic problems).  [I am a physicist be training,
     not a pure mathematician, hence the bias].  The technology to
     be presented is believed to provide a level of cryptographic
     security that is totally immune to cryptanalysis.

   - Summary of content
       :  mathematical and physical principles involved
       :  encryption methodology  (general approaches)
            :  substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers and
               superencipherment
       :  application to key management 
       :  application to secure Identification and Authorization
       :  application to data, fax, video and voice encryption

   - Sample software implementations, detailed algorithms and
     detailed technical information will be made freely available
     to U.S. and Canadian citizens as provided for by ITAR and U.S.
     State Department regulations  [see ITAR/export footnote]

   - the technology and sample implementations have been reviewed
     and evaluated by the National Security Agency, which found
     them to be cryptographically "robust".  

   - reviewers' comments and criticisms will be greatly appreciated
     and used to clarify and improve the presentation of the
     concepts and methodology.

Anyone who is interested to peer reviewing this paper should
contact me via e-mail at richardr@netcom.com .  In addition, if you
know someone who you feel would be an appropriate reviewer, please
either forward this message to them or, alternatively, send me
their e-mail address and I will contact them to see if they are
interested.  

If you are interested also reviewing the detailed algorithms,
technical data and sample programs, please include the following
information in your e-mail message to me:

     1.   Your citizenship (must be USA or Canadian) 
     2.   Your willingness to comply with relevant export laws.
     3.   Your willingness to comply with relevant usage terms 
          (ie, no commercial, resale use).
     4.   Your Internet e-mail address and the country in which
          your e-mail host resides.

Sorry for the inconvenience but this is necessary to avoid legal
hassles that I have neither the resources nor the inclination to
get involved with at this time.  This information is required
_only_ if you want a copy of the detailed technical information. 
The paper on the mathematical basis and principles is available to
anyone.

*****    ITAR/Export footnote  --  Editorial Disclaimer   ******

To avoid (or at least limit) the inevitable political discussion
about public domain / technical data / XIII(b) controls and whether
this should or should not be export controlled, please be advised
that I have spoken to the relevant entities in the State Department
Office of Defense Technology Control and the National Security
Agency and I am freely complying with their interpretation of what
can be published and how it can be published.  

I have _no_ intent to circumvent the established process and law by
publishing this paper and have received oral assurances from both
sources that I am complying with U.S. laws.  I am publishing only
general scientific and engineering principles and am acting in my
role as a private research scientist.  

While I admire and support the efforts of Phil Zimmermann, Ward
Grady, Viacrypt, EFF and others, I do not encourage anyone to
violate any laws and will not assist anyone to violate the law. 
However, I cannot assume any responsibility for the actions of
anyone over whom I have no direct authority or control.  Anyone who
disagrees with the official government interpretation of any law
must assume the consequences of his or her actions and be prepared
to defend them to the extent necessary.
