Nope.

There is no "chip" that scans dollar bills.  Dollar bill scanning is based
on the magnetic ink in a few simple stripes, the presence (actually, 
absence) of UV fluorescent inks, and not on optical recognition per se,
and besides, we all know how "reliable" such machines are.  NOT!

Besides, even if a pattern-match chip existed that could do it fast enough, 
simply turning the bill a few degrees (say, 45 degrees, across the glass)
would render the problem intractable...

And how about adding a background of stripes... something to really confuse
the chip....  

Sorry, no.
