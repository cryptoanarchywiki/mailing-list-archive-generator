John Gilmore wanted me to let the list know that there will be a
hearing this Friday, Oct. 29, at the Federal Courthouse at 450
Golden Gate in SF, around 9:30 am (time is always unclear), in
his FOIA suit against the FBI/DOJ re release of documents in the
Clipper Chip matter.

Very briefly, we have received some mostly uninteresting documents
regarding Clipper so far.  We moved for an index of the withheld
documents and for expedited processing.  

The gov't response was to move for a stay of proceedings until
early 1997.  That's not a typo-- almost 4 years!

We sent them some discovery as to their FOIA processing, and
they then moved for a protective order barring discovery.

So basically, what we're going to be arguing about on Friday
is whether the case moves forward, or gets put on hold until
the FBI gets around to processing John's request.  

John encourages interested cypherpunks to attend.  He will not
be there himself.  

Feel free to e-mail me, Lee Tien, for details.  I prefer to
be reached at tien@well.sf.ca.us.
