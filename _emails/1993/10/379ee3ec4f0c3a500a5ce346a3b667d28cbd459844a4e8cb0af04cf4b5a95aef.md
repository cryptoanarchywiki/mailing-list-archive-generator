Actually, not. Apple's PowerTalk environment uses persona certificates
right now, although entities may buy RSA's Safekeeper boxes
("tamperproof" titanium key generators) to generate actual warranted
keys.

All a persona certificate says is that key X belongs to person Y. No
warranty, express or implied, is granted. If I have a persona
certificate, say, from Dun & Bradstreet, all D&B is claiming is that
the key on that certificate belongs to *me*. They could potentially be
liable if the key actually belonged to someone else, but they wouldn't
be liable if I used that key to embezzle $10M from the EFF Digital
Credit Union.
