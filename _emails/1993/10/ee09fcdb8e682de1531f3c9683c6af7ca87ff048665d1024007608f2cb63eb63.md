Hey Doug,

Well, as I mentioned in an earlier post, I'm one who doesn't favor
labelling anonymous mail - I'd rather work on positive reputation
schemes, cash accepting remailers, etc.  An anonymous remailer that
charges will discourage people from using it for frivolous purposes;
digital signature combined with positive filters will let people
filter out posters they consider stupid.

After all, you are more interested in who sent the mail than where it
originated from.

(I've been working on a script that checks elm mail folders for pgp
signed messages and reports the signature instead of From: address;
and a cash accepting remailer).

The attitude expressed by the individual on io.com shows a problem we
will have in educating others - "anonymous posts CAN destroy a civil
conversation".  Yes, maybe so, but in my experience on mailing lists,
bbses, etc. I've noticed that "flame wars" and "anonymous posts" have
NO correlation, and are quite independent of one another.  

Since I've seen "flame wars" on systems with absolutely no anonymous
posting facilities (or none that were used), I conclude that civil
conversation is destroyed by strongly held differences in opinions (or
some other factor I can't pin down).

However, I would be interested in hearing if filtering anonymous
mail/posts does significantly cut down on or eliminate the destruction
of civil conversation.
