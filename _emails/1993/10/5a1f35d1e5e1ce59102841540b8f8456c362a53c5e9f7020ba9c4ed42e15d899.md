RE fire: you can still read ashes, it's commonly done.  Now as an addendum
to my previous about the use of blenders: for larger amounts, the kitchen
sink disposall with lots of water running... for really large amounts, soak
in a large container full of water for a few days to let it get soft, then
mush it up with either an electric cement mixer or a 1/2" electric drill
with paint mixing attachment.  The key to these operations is lots of water
so the paper will essentially be a suspended solid that easily tumbles and
shreds.  Too much paper in the mix will lead to a soggy mat that won't break
up easily.
