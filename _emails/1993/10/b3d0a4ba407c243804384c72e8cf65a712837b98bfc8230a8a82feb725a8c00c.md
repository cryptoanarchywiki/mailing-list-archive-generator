Yup, the state has been counting on this for years.  It's
hard to explain how people put up with the shit they put up with
any other way.  Wilhelm Reich talked about this many many years
ago (concept of "character armor," which is probably where WSB got
the idea.  To paraphrase WR: "The puzzling thing isn't why 2% of
people who are starving steal food, but why the other 98% *don't*."
(Forgive my anti-propertarian example, but I think you get the
idea.)
