This is exactly what anonymous remailers are for - to defeat traffic
analysis.  The goal is a situation where you, and everyone else, receives
and sends out a bunch of encrypted traffic every day.  There will be
no way a snooper can find out exactly what you are reading, what you
are writing, or whom you are communicating with.  That's what I call
private.
