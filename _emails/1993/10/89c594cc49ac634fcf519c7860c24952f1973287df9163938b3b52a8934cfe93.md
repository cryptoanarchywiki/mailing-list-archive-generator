This posting illustrates the common logic problem behind rationales for
e-mail snooping. Note that, according to anonymous, there was no criminal
activity detected on this NirvanaNet node. Yet it was still searched.

What triggered the search of NirvanaNet seems to have been the unencrypted
discussions and text files, not the encrypted or private mail.

The notion that e-mail snooping has some kind of magic power to prevent
police searches still has no evidence to support it.
