  maybe i'm just stupid, but i haven't seen this discussed yet.

  has anyone realized that there will be a lot of encrypted data
  out there when the "general public" starts using encryption
  regularly?  think about it.  people will pick passwords/phrases
  that they *think* they'll remember when they next decide to
  decrypt the file or whatever.  and these are the people that
  come out of shopping malls and have hard time finding where
  they parked car.

  how many times have you had to regen your pub/sec keys?  :)

                                                sweet & sour,
