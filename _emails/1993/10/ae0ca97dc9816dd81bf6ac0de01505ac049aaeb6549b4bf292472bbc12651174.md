Then the messages that I compose on this host will simply have to
be delayed, as I still refuse to keep my private key on an "open" 
system. In fact, the _only_ time in which I attach a digital
signature to any of my messages is from my PC at home.

Call me a prude, but this is a fact of life I'm sure you will
encounter with other folks as well.

Cheers.
