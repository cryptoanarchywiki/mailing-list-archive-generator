The card already exists. It is called the TESERA (sp?) card. Guess what,
it uses the Capstone chip (clipper + key exchange).

I have also heard a rumour that there is a proposal to use a similar version
of Capstone for the Administrations Health ID card.

Clipper, coming to a health care provider near you...
