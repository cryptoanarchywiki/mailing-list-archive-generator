  I would like to use PGP on multiple platforms, and am unsure
of which version I should use to maximize my interoperability with
other PGP users.  

  In the PGP documentation, "hmiller@lucpul.it.luc.edu" is listed 
as a source of info regarding the availability of PGP for various 
computer platforms.  I EMailed Mr. Miller but recieving no response.
Finger indicates he hasn't used that account in over a month.
John Draper suggested I contact you. 

  I am unable to read PGP2.23 files created under DOS on the Macintosh
running MACPGP2.2.  I saw nothing in the "newfor23" file to indicated 
that the PGP file format had been changed so as to be incompatible.  Are 
you familiar with this problem?  Is there a MACPGP2.23 in the works?
