Found a new 'undocumented feature' of pgp just now. in a recent message
apparently from Future Nerd Steve W., the message begins with the usual 
-----------Begin pgp signed message--------- Header.
Then later in the message, as sortof a joke I think, he he put:
- ---------Begin philosophy------------- and then later an end philosophy
and a begin pgp sig. So when I tried to verify the signature, pgp gave me
a 'Failure striping ascii armor' error and said 'ascii armor error in
signed file' or something like that. So I guess that use of anything that
looks like a pgp header to pgp within the message invalidates any pgp sig.

Happy Hunting, -Chris.
