This kind of knee-jerk reaction dismays me.  My response *was* about
cryptography.  Perhaps the following test would prevent you from (1)
wasting bandwidth and (2) turning off people who are trying to put the
flood of crypto info into perspective:

   "Does this email add any value to the discussion?"

Give the rest of us a break; your usual postings are worth reading.
