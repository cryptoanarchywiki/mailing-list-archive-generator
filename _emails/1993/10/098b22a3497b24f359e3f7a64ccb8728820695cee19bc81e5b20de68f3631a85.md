I wish to clarify a point here.  The system as I envision it would not
have a single currency.  Rather, each MUD/MOO would create its own
currency or currencies.  Interdomain transfer would be accomplished by
trading promissory notes.

As to what the money buys, at the very least it could buy those things
which resolve down to CPU time and disk space and network bandwidth.
