What are your thoughts on solutions which do not do either of these
alternatives?  For example, several people have discussed systems
involving two sets of addresses.  These avoid both problems

message with a sig), at the cost of some complexity.

Aren't you detweiling a bit here?  I don't think the situation really
warrants "utter disgust"...
