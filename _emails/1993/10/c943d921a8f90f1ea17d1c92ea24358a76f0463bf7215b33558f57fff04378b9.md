Part of the "hunt and destroy vs. cost to deploy" equation thread about
spread spectrum networks was forwarded to me. How about putting several
cheap noise generators on the air as decoys? This might tip the cost
balance in favor of the network.
 
The Julieboard Direct Digital Synthesizer board, which only needs numbers
fed to it from a PC printer port or microcontroller output, can be bought
wired and tested for $125. Production in volume should be cheaper. So who
is hunting down transmitters and killing them, and risking a confrontation
with an armed opponent, for this paltry sum?
