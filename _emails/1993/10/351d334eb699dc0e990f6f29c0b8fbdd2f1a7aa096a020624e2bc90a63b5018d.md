Disclaimer:  I have aprox 100 Cypherpunk messages to read following this one.

My point was that the women still pretended to be someone else, and had a
completely different personality for this Agent.  She did it to be
deceptive.  All of L Detweiler's post have stated that he doesn't like
people's abilities to pretend to be someone else.  My point was that
people do this all the time.  Even to the extent that people act
differently around others.  When you talk on cypherpunks do you have the
same "Personality" as when you talk to others who don't own computers?
