Haha!  That's exactly how I got hyped about the Julieboard --
rummaging in the backlog of the voluminous-but-valuable cpunk posts...

My question:  Exactly how cheap can we make these things?  Mass
produced boards, a bag of appropriate components, and a few dozen
cpunks working in parallel could work wonders.  

What about surface mount components?  Harder to assemble, and fewer
people have the skills, but the resulting box would be very small
and more easily concealed.

If you are hiding boxes on telco poles, an obvious source of power
presents itself.  :-)

I like the EMF idea!  Ideologically and technically interesting...
Is it practical?   Heat to electricity?  hmm...

Someone suggested general use of IR laser links, but someone else 
mentioned that it would be a bitch to operate a decentralized network 
of IR links.  Well, lasers and microwave are probably best suited for
mid-range connections betweens clusters of boxes.

(Ham radio tinkers with microwave and laser communication experience
 should probably comment here...  )

Since the FCC frowns on encrypted amateur radio, I doubt we could
openly use the ham nets or satellites...but how about bit fiddling
with slow-scan TV?  :-)  The list has generated many good ideas
on tunneling naughty data in otherwise innocent exchanges...

How many people are interested in this idea?  Is it time for
a radiopunk task force?  Does one already exist?  :-)
