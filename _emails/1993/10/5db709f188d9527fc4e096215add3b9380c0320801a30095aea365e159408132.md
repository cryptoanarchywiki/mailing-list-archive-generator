Subject: RSA exmaples required


I'm authoring an article for a german computer magazine about PGP and
the RSA public key scheme and I'd like to include an exmaple for my
mathematical explaination. The problem is, that both factors have to
be quite large to get nice examples.

        p = 5    q = 7

        xy = 4*6+1 = 25         x=5
                                y=5

You see, with smaller factors, x and y are equal or 1 and xy. But a
larger set of factors would require a serious amount of calculations.
:-))

So, does somebody have a nice example for the RSA algorithm ready??

        bye, Peter
