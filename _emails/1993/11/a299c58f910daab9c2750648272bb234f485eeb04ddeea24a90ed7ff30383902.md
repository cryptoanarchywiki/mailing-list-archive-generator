Without disputing anything Phil says here, I have it on good authority
that the exemption of cordless phones from ECPA had to do with the fact
that early models of cordless phones often generated signals that could
be picked up by normal radios. The concern was that the owners of normal
radios (as distinct from scanners) might be turned into felons for
overhearing a cordless-phone conversation.
