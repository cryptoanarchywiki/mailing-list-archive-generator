permitted or not, so I am posting just a pointer.   Trot on over to
biz.clarinet.sample, and check out this article:

> Subject: Software you can buy but can't sell
> Message-ID: <biz-computerUR971_3N1@clarinet.com>

>	In mid-October, the House Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade and
> Environment began a round of hearings on legislation to reauthorize the
> Export Administration Act, which sets export control policy for the
> United States.

Peeve:  I wish tech editors wouldn't insist on spelling out acronyms
that nobody ever (ever! Well, except tech writers/editors) uses in
their spelled out form.  If they must spell them out, do it in parens,

Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol suite" is (eg).
