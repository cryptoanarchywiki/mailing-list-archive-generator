I have just been reading d. Chaum's _Security without identification:
Card Computers to make Big Brother Obsolete_ and have some questions.
But Ill ask the serious ones in another post.  For this one, and to
satisfy the comparable conspiracy buffs on the list, look
first at the Cypherpunks Wired issue.  Now look at the comic
in Chaum's paper.  I guess that bearded guy with the longer
hair could be....hmm....Jamie...no...Nick...no ITS TIM MAY!
