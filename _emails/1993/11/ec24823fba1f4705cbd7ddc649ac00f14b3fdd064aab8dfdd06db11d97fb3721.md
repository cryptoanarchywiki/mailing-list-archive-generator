I'm having some trouble using the morepgp filter program that's in the
contrib/elm_nn directory of the PGP distribution.  It works nicely in
most respects.  However, I haven't been able to choose a good pager
program for morepgp to send its output to.

If I tell morepgp to use the 'more' program, it will page through the
mail message until it gets to the end.  When that happens, elm
suddenly retakes control and clears the screen.  The last screenful of
the message is therefore on the screen only an instant.  This is
unacceptable.

A lesser problem is when the mail message has a PGP signature.  As pgp
works on it, it will say something to the effect of
	good signature from <user> at <timestamp>
However, it immediately passes control to more, which doesn't pause the
screen until the "good signature" message has already scrolled off the
screen.  At least in an xterm window I can scroll back.

Speaking of less, that's the default pager for morepgp, but it has
problems also.  It has the same problem as more where the pgp
signature information scrolls off the screen before it can be read.
However, since less clears the screen between each screenful, there is
no way to scroll back using the scroll bars of an xterm window.  Thus
I only get a few miliseconds to read whether whose signature was on
that mail message I just read...  I haven't found any command line options
for less that disable the screen clears.

Does anyone have any solutions to this problem?
