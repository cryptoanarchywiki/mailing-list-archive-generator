        company limited by shares
        foundations and trusts

        Swiss francs), local  resident taxes

        drug, fraud, theft, or tax investigations.  They
        might assist in money laundering and insider
        trading investigations, informing the customer
        first.
 
 
Yes but,
 
Liechtenstein,
Not LEIchtenstein.
 
:)
 
You'll find it difficult to invest less than 1.5 million in Liechtenstein
secretly.
