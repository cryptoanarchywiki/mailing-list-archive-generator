This statement, like the following, is like a rich vein of 
valuable insight into the extra-technical aspects of the issue.

I found myself reading this next part over several times, and each pass
I found that I associated what I understood to other unspoken questions I have.

affording us an edge.

Anything you are *required* to keep secret, is more valuable to the 
*requiring agency* than to you.

Anything you are expected to accept on faith, can't be proven.
