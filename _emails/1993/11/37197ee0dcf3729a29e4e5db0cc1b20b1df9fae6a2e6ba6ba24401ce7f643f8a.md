I find it very ironic that a list dedicated to the preservation of personal
privacy, seeks to exterpigate one of its own through White Supremacist 
tactics
of hassling the "enemy's" employer.  I recall a week ago or so, someone
posting something to the effect of:  "There's a lot to learn from the Nazi
methods of rooting out Communists...."  Disturbing coincidence or Illumanati
plot?  Perhaps.  Then again, maybe its just a mob mentality to storm the
castle and burn the Frankenstein monster.

No thanks, keep the torch (you'll need it, those castle's get very dark at
night).  Its none of my business whether or not L. Det wants to post
"quasi-religious" rants or even if he wants to leech off of alt.erotica
every day with his "state-funded" account.  My business is the preservation 
of
the freedom of speech, even if I don't agree with the speaker...

I apologize for seizing the moral high ground in so smug a fashion, but the
precedent that this behaivor is setting is too disturbing to ignore.  Now,
continue to pave and flaaaame away me paranoid kin....!
