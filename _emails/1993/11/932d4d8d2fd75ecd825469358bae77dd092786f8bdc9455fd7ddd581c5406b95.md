This helps, but is imperfect. How many people will read their particular
copy in sufficient detail to ascertain that there aren't any obvious
backdoors added by e.g. a sneaky archive site maintainer, or some sneaky
cracker who found a way to modify the archived copy?

Furthermore, even close reading won't absolutely *guarantee* the lack of
backdoors in all cases, even if the reader is an expert on relevant
subjects.

We'll all continue to use software despite lack of absolute assurances,
but it's worth keeping in mind what the situation is.
