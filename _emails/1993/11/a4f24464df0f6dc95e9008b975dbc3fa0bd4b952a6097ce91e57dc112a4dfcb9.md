On behalf of a bunch of people at Cygnus, I've a small request to make
of the Cypherpunks.  When you bring chairs into the conference room
for your meeting, *please* remember where you got them.  That way, at
the end of the meeting, they can go back where they came from, and we
don't have to spend Monday morning trying to find our chairs around
the office.

Thanks,
Brendan
