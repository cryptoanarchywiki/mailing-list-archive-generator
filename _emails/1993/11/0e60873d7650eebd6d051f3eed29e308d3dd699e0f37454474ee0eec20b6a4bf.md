I consider the Sternlight-bashing suggestions to be unreasonable;
Sternlight may rave from a warped, pro-government viewpoint,
but he is capable of carrying on civilized conversations, even when
he's (continually) grinding the same axe.  The coffee-house analogy
is a very good one, and there *is* occasionally a screaming-children
problem on usenet; I assumed the original poster was referring more to
the perpetual-newbie types rather than to the newly arrived,
chronologically-deficient college students, most of whom are either
quiet, productive, or both (though a college student and the author 
apparently felt otherwise :-)
  
I still prefer having this as a mailing
list, in spite of the volume; I can read sci.crypt when I want to,
though I'll probably have to get a netcom account rather than
keep telnetting into my old system now that I've moved.

	Thanks;  Bill
