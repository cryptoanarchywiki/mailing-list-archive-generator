"Perry Metzger" doesn't carefully read the postings which he directly
quotes before passing judgement.

I never claimed that nobody offers completely anonymous accounts.  I claimed
that, to the best of my knowledge, nobody offers the "numbered accounts" that 
used to be popular in Switzerland.  

Austria does offer "bearer share" accounts which are completely anonymous,
but are quite different than the "numbered accounts" of old-time Switzerland.
In a "numbered account", the owner uses a hand-written rendition of the account
number as a signature.  The hand-written number is compared against bank records
to validate the authenticity of the owner.  "Bearer share" accounts, which are
available in Austria, are issued to the user with some sort of ceritificate
of ownership.  Anyone (the "bearer") who has possession of the certificate 
("share") can withdraw money from the account.  No signatures or hand-writen
numbers are used to verify the owner.


If Austria does offer true numbered accounts, then I stand corrected.
