I receive an unsolicited e-mail from these people just the other day.  It said  
something to effect of

"I have heard that you may be interested in implementing UNIX/Mac/PC  
software...I have a database of contact addresses that may interest you...I am  
NOT selling anything...If I have mis-read your intentions, I apologize.   
However, could you forward this letter to someone would may be interested."

I deleted it.
