Harassing other users is considered abuse, and sending chain letters is a
form of harassing other users.  However, it's not a very serious form of
abuse.  If I found conclusive evidence that someone were sending something
like childporn through my remailer, I would take some pretty drastic
actions.  Chainletters are just an annoyance.

Well, there aren't any guidelines for the proper use.  The only things which
are improper uses are uses designed to make the Net a less friendly place by
harassing other users, and uses which I find morally unbearable, like
childporn or something like that.

Note that the only way I found out that you had sent that through my
remailer was because the mail bounced.  The only way I am aware of stuff
going through my remailer is stuff that bounces or when recipients of mail
complain.  I don't read logs; I wouldn't have time to do that if I had 30
hour days, and besides, most of it is encrypted anyway.
