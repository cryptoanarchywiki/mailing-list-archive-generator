Presumably something like that.

It needn't be signed by both parties. The bank could always simply
claim that you'd never given them an order to withdraw money and
refuse to give it to you -- cheating halfway into giving you a receipt
isn't interesting, so it also needn't be simultaneous. 

What needed is a) the bank has to be able to show a third party a
signed request for every transaction they've performed, and b) you
have to be able to show a third party a signed (by the bank) receipt
for every transaction you've performed. In other words, you are
protected because the bank can't simply claim to the arbitrator "oh,
he withdrew all his money yesterday" because they can't show an order.
The bank is protected because you can't claim "oh, I deposited ten
million dollars yesterday" if you can't show a receipt.
