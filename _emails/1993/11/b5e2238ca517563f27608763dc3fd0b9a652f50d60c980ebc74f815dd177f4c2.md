	I know this might not be the most appropriate list to post this 
to, but I need to know what ports Telnet uses for standard use.  Mainly, 
I implemented the Telnet bouncer program that was posted here a while 
back, and when trying to connect to hosts that don't require a port 
number it still asks me for one.

	i.e., when I try to connect to archie.sura.net through the 
bouncer, it asks me for a port number.  When I use my standard Telnet 
program it will connect with just archie.sura.net as the address.  Does 
anybody know a site where I can find this info?  Thanx in advance and my 
apologies for any waste of bandwidth!
