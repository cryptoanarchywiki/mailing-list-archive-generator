Subject: Brady bill overcomes filibusters and flip tongue


An interesting note buried at the end of a UPI story follows:

[deleted details of bantering between Dole, Mitchell and Biden]

	Without Biden, Mitchell arranged a face-saving compromise that got
the bill behind him and Dole: The Senate would pass separate legislation
early next year calling for a computerized, instant-background check on
gun buyers within 24 months so it could possibly negate the waiting
period.
	There is no assurance the House will pass that measure.
	Without the compromise, ``we would have put it off until January,''
or later, Dole said.
	As for Biden?
	``We both know politics.''



What a bunch of cards those boys are. 

Brian
