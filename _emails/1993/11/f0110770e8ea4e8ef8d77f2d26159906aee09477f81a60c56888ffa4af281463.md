Well, I did for one.  Some of you may remember me posting to sci.crypt
quite some time ago, because the one thing I wasn't happy about was the
use of a probabilistic primality tester when there were completely
certain primality tests available (albeit a bit more expensive in cpu).
(especially since I didn't understand how the probabilistic one worked)

I see from a posting on sci.crypt today that the probabilistic tests
have been show to be possibly mildly weak in some infrequent cases.
Probably not worth worrying about, but still, it's a sobering thought.

The rest of the code I understood well enough to trust it, mostly :)
