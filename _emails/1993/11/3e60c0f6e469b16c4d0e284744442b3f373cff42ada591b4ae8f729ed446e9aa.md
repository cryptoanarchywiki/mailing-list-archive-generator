Ah, yes.  Once again, it's time to upgrade the APS software here at khijol.
For those who don't know, I run an anonymous posting site which posts to only
a select set of newsgroups (to prevent abuse).  Now that the machine is
sitting on the Internet, it's time to revamp the software, and I have thought
that it might be easier to hack someone else's than to redo my own (which
was one of those all-day hack sessions).

Double blind remailing and unique ID services are essential,  with the 'nice
to have' services like automatic pinging of posts, checksum verifications of
posts, automatic encryption/decryption of posts, etc. would be ideal.

Any ideas on where I could obtain such software?  Shell scripts are OK, C
is better.  Perl is not desirable unless I really have to. :(

Thanks!
