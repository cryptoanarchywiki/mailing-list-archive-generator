Once again encryption is on the minds of the business community. In the Nov. 
22 issue of business week, Carl Ellison is highlighted along with Whitfield
Diffie in an article which asserts that those of us once considered paranoid
are soon to be considered prescient. Excerpts from the article:

>When executives at Stratus headquarters hold teleconferences with the 
>company's with San Jose (Calif.) engineering center or other offices, 
>Ellison insists that their words and video be encrypted. He *even* (emphasis
>mine) encodes routine electronic mail...Some coworkers call Ellison paranoid. 

I will venture to say that paranoid (in this context) will soon be synonymous  
with cautious.

>Cryptography is absolutely essential to any kind of electronic business 
>communication", says Price Waterhouse partner Douglas Kalish.

>While AT&T, a big government supplier, has agreed to put clipper in its 
>secure phones, many companies simply don't trust the governments promises
>not to snoop illegally.

It would be interesting if the gov't ended up with a cryptography system
that has a back door and everyone else had a secure system. Fun with reversal 
of fortune.

Finally, Whitfield Diffie's quote, "Clipper is the most rancid idea to come 
along in quite some time".

As the pendulum swings further toward freedom to encrypt, it's going to take
ever more of us to keep it there. Teach anyone who will learn so the pendulum
rests on many shoulders. Also here is my Cypherpunks ID Key, I swear that 
it belongs to the nym my mom gave me and who signed this message, when a 
better verification method presents itself I will avail myself of it.
