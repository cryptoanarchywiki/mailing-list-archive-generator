Hi all!  Just a quick update on my procmail mail processor rc file.  I have most
of the functionality implemented.  I'm working on speeding up mail delivery and
making sure I don't have a file locking problem.  So far, my system will:
 
1    Accept incoming mail and determine if it contains a pgp message, key,
     or signature.
 
2    If it contains a message, it determines who can read it.
 
3    If it contains a key, it is added to your pubring.pgp
 
4    If it contains a signed message, the signature is validated.
 
5    An informative subset of pgp's output is tacked onto the head of the
     message, surrounded by user-defined lines to prevent spoofing of the
     validation info.
 
6    Finally, the subject of the mail is prefixed with either (key),
     (sig), (prv) to indicate that the message contains a key, signed
     message, or encrypted (private) message.
 
I also have the capability to use procmail as a pgp-info server.  You could send
me mail with the subject: send pgp-help and my machine would send you a file
which contains help for pgp.  This could lead to lots of uses....
 
Any comments are welcome.  I should be releasing my procmailrc file within the
week.  Take care, all
 
Lagers,
