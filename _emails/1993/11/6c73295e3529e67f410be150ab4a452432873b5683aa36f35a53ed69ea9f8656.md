Of course they have to be able to prove that you did so.  Cash cards raise 
real proof problems.

There are no tax consequences to cash per se.  The issue is whether the 
cash constitutes unreported income or not.  A separate issue.

However, by spreading the "importation" out over time, cash cards reduce 
the chances that a "structuring" count could be proved against you.  The 
whole cash card thing really mixes up the exact location of the money.  
What if you are overseas and buy a VISA USA cash card and then bring it 
into the US.  Is this a reportable transaction?  Presumably the payment 
for the card was wired by your overseas institution to VISA USA, a bank 
wire is not reportable.  In any case, the overseas institution may not 
link you with its purchase of a VISA Cash Card from the US.

Complications.
