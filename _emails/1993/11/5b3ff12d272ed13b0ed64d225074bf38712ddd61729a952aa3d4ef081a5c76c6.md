That _appears_ to just be a mirror of the soda.berkeley.edu site, that
is, a buch of files, programs, rants, intros, etc.

I could find no evidence of posts to the list being archived there.

Again, the issue is not that the List be hidden, or secret....it
obviously is fairly well-known by now.

The issue is that of mailing list vs. newsgroup. Local gateways into a
newsgroup format are much different than, say, "alt.cypherpunks"
appearing around the world. Some would like this, some would not, but
no one can say things would be the same if this came to pass.
