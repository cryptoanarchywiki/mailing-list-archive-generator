It's not chivalry; it's copyright law. The creator of a message owns the
copyright to that intellectual property; the recipient owns the copy of the
message, much like one who buys a recorded album owns the copy of the work.
The message you quoted contained the statement "Do not forward/reproduce
this message" or words to that effect. That is a clear statement by the
copyright holder which limits any redistribution rights that might have
otherwise become yours upon receipt of the message.

Given the nature of the communication (i.e. mention of potential email
bombing), I believe you'd be within your rights to share the threatening
content of the message with upstream mail host admins who might play a role
in preventing such an occurance; but no further.

It's also common courtesy. You can have significant disagreements with a
person, yet still honor their simple requests.

Jason
