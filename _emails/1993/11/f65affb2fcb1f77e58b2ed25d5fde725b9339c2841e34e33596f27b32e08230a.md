One thing that frustrates me is the difficulty of easily providing
implementations of cryptographic algorithms that would be useful on a
wide range of machines.  A lot of these algorithms are really simple,
almost trivial.  Yet to write programs to implement them takes pages and
pages of code, and making them portable so that people on PC's, Mac's, and
Unix machines can use them is almost impossible.

Take the simple Chaum cash we have discussed here a few times.  The
user picks a random x and a random r, calculates r^3*f(x) where f is some
one-way function, and sends it to the bank.  The bank takes the cube root
and sends it back, then the user divides by r.  That's pretty simple.  Yet
to actually implement software to perform these steps raises a host of
complications.

First, we want to choose a "random" x and r in the range 0..m-1, where
m is the bank's public key modulus.  But we want these to be strong,
unguessable random numbers.  We need an unpredictable RNG,
and we need to seed it.  There are various URNG's that are provably as
strong as breaking factoring, discrete logarithms, and such, so these
would have to be implemented (as before, most are conceptually trivial).
Or you could run DES or IDEA in a feedback mode and take bits from there,
for a little less security but more speed.

For seeding the RNG you could do like PGP does and retain random numbers
from earlier runs, mixing in new randomness when feasible; you could do
like RIPEM and scan disk partitions hoping for randomness (I think RIPEM
has a lot of other ways of looking for entropy); you could use hardware
features like /dev/audio or the free-running, high-speed timers some PC's
have; you can get the user to click the mouse or type keys at random.

OK, we've got our random numbers.  Now we want a one-way function.  Again,
there are several choices: MD4 and MD5 from RSA; the Secure Hash Standard
NIST is pushing; Ralph Merkle's (I forget the name); others based on
conventional ciphers like DES or IDEA.  Implementations of these are
probably available, but portability is a question mark.

Now we need a multi-precision math package.  We may have needed one for
the URNG, too.  There are a lot of libraries available in source code
for these, but not many of them will work with 16-bit ints, and are
tested on DOS and Mac's as well as Unix.

Finally, to send the data around, we may want to convert to and from ASCII,
and once again there are a lot of choices, but perhaps not too many
portable libraries.  I suppose RFC1113 and MIME, which are similar but
not quite identical, would be the encodings of choice.

The point I'm getting to is that it would be nice if all this were done
ONCE, and a library made and tested which would work on a wide range
of machines.  Entry points for one-way functions, multi-precision
arithmetic, unpredictable random numbers, conventional encryption, and
ascii conversions could all be provided.  Multiple alternatives would be
supported as much as possible and it should not be difficult to add more
as time goes on.

Once you had such a library, it would be possible to add a user interface
to allow interactive use of the routines.  It could be as simple as the
Unix "bc" program where you can say "x = y*z" to do arithmetic, or perhaps
"x = md5(y)" to call a one-way function.  Or the library could perhaps be
linked into perl or some other high-level program (does mathematica have
hooks for compiled user code?).  The nice thing is that since most of the
compute time is spent doing the MP arithmetic in these algorithms, an
interpreted system which calls compiled libraries can be as efficient as
a purely compiled program.

I know that others here have made similar proposals in the past, but
I have not heard of many results.  I'd like to hear more about whether
these efforts have produced anything that could be incorporated.  It
would also be good to hear suggestions for specific existing packages that
would meet the portability requirements.  I've looked at a couple of MP
packages from ripem.msu.edu but so far I haven't had much luck running them
under DOS.

Perhaps a project like this could allow progress to be made more easily
toward cypherpunk goals.  By providing a toolkit to programers newly
interested in cryptography people will be able to try out ideas more
easily without having to re-invent the wheel each time.

Let me know if you would be interested in participating in this effort.
Hopefully a lot of the pieces already exist and it will just be a matter
of pulling them together.
