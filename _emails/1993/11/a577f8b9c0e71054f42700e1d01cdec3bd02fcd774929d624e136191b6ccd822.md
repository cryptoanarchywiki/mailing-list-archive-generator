   What I'd like to get opinions on is _should I encrypt this header information_, 
   since its format will be known to an attacker and, in many cases, its contents 
   easy to guess? My inclination is to leave it plaintext, since the worst that 
   can happen if a file type is known is the same type of attack that would 
   _always_ be possible with an encrypted header.
   
   Thanks to all with thoughts on the subject.

I do think that you should encrypt this information.

What if you embed the header at some random point in the file, with
the last bytes of the file being a pointer to where the header is? You
can then splice the header information out of the decrypted stream.

Cryptoexperts: Does this make it harder to use the header information
to decrypt the file? What if you embed a series of pointers: ie.
Pointer to pointer to pointer to header, all of which get spliced out
in the end.

Or how about embedding the header in an out of band stream which is
part of the file - Escape signals an out of band message and
Escape-Escape the old Escape character. Then you could also place the
header at a random point in the file. I suppose that you get
information about the frequency of the escape character (since the
file grows) but that can be masked by appending a random amount of
extraneous data in all files).
