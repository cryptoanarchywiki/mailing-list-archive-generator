Hey all,

I just wanted to let you know (as an ex-SEAL), the NSA (and to a limited
extent CIA) have UNBELIEVEABLE resources!

If anyone could crack RSA, DES, OPP...they could.

Never underestimate the power of a "black" budget (or for that matter soup)



The PUNISHER
Judge; Jury; Executioner....All in a day's work

Mob Boss: "500 of my men killed; there is a limit to revenge you know"
Punisher: "I haven't reached mine yet"




{% endraw %}
