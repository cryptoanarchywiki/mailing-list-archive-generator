cypherpunks interested in identity mutations, perversions, and crimes
like MPD, impersonation, pseudospoofing, etc., and developing a
legendary anecdotes and a complex mythology regarding it all with e.g.
compiled science fiction references, (who comprise the majority of the
members, based on my mail and enemies) may be delighted by the
masterpiece novella `Mefisto in Onyx' by Harlan Ellison in the Oct.
1993 Omni magazine.
