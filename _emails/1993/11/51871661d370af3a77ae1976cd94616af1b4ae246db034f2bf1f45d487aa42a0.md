T.C.May:

>do.  Personally, I consider it a necessity.  I like being able to hide
>behind an anonymous identity (not that I do, mind you).  I don't see
>pseudospoofing as "constraining".  On the contrary, I see it as
>freeing us.

E.Hughes, on Pseudospoofing software
>No the software isn't mine, but I consider myself it's God Father.
>Tim May and I were talking about this a long
>time, and he just beat me to learning enough PERL to write the thing.
>But I'd like to think that the two of us did most all of the design of
>it.  So, in a way, it is my software.

Nick Szabo:
>As an example, look at Ender's Game, where Ender's brother and sister
>get on the net under pseudonyms, and get treated just like everyone
>else.  There is no biases.  People are judged on their actions and
>words, not by who they are, how old they are, what they look like, or
>anything like that.  Maybe you are blind, I don't know.  I've never
>met you.

Arthur Chandler:
>And, as I said, it is not the job of the Keyserver to provide any sort
>of policy.  The job of the Keyserver is to distribute keys.  Nothing
>more.  Nothing less.  The job of identifying True Names is solely a
>job for Digital Signatures, not a job for the Keyserver.  

Jamie Dinkelacker:
>I oppose using it in a bogus fashion because the software is not
>designed for such a use, there is absolutely no protection for it (any
>key can be added), because I, and all the other Keyserver admins,
>believe that all the keyservers should be interconnected, and because
>I feel the job for determining a True Name on a key is a job for
>Digital Signatures, not for the Keyserver.  

Perry Metzger:
>I am a cypherpunk.  I don't believe in trusting something on faith
>alone, but you seem to be asking for that.  There is no way to protect
>such a reckless use of the Keyserver.  The only way to provide a
>secure way for True Names is to Cryptographically identify them.

Hal Finney:
>So, Mr. Detweiler, why do you oppose using Digital Signatures to
>verify True Names?  I mean, besides that you consider yourself a
>Cypherpunk? ;-)
