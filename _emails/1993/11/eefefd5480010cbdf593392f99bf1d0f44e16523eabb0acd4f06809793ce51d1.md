For a moment there, yes. But alas, I have the problem fixed. You see,
I was gating the list into a local group for my own purposes, and was not 
aware my machine (albemuth) was batching the list outgoing. My smarthost 
asked about this as it was being junked on his end. Well evidently, the
junking stopped and alas <cypherpunks.list> starting showing up on 
Netcom. 

The problem is corrected. Sorry if anyone is upset, but alas, shit 
happens. ;)
