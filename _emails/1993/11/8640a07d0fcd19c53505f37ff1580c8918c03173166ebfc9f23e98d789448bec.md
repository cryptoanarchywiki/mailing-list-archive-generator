If you looked inside, perhaps you saw where the switches are?

I've been told that the SecurId cards have two membrane-style switches
on the face (not actually marked though.) The initial key is
programmed by keying it in through those switches; the "protocol" ends
with a command to "ignore any further input from these switches"...

Early ones were hand-keyed, they then went to a robot mechanism, and
now apparently there is a device which takes a hopper full of cards
and keys them in in parallel batches (something like 20 at a time for
the machine I heard about a year ago.)

This is all stories I heard (as far as I know, second hand from
SecurID people) but it would be interesting to confirm the existance
of the switches...
