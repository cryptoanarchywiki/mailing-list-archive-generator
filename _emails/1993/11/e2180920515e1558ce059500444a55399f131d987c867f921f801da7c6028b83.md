The basic fact of number theory here is the prime number theorem,
which says that (for the purposes of this problem) the number of
primes less than N approaches N/ln N.  For N=2^192 (say, for cracking
384 bit PGP keys), that number is 2^192/133, which is about 2^185.
The number of bits necessary to store all of these primes is even
larger.  A gigabyte is only 2^38 bits.

In plainer language, there's just too many to store.  This same
calculation also explains why there will never be a shortage of
primes.
