# 	I was just talking with a friend, and I think it would be

# that /dcc does diffie-hellman key exchange, and maybe triple-des or
# something.

DH itself is a trivial algorithm.  All you need is a decent
multiple precsion math package.    I think all it takes is
	-- random numbers
	-- primality test
	-- gcd
	-- raise-to-power-modulo-some-number

There's lots of Multiple Precision libraries availble.
The Gnu 'gmp' is more than sufficient.  Also des is very
easy to ftp.  See the cypherpunks ftp site at 
	ftp://soda.berkeley.edu/pub/cypherpunks/
for pointers.

BTW, schneier is literally a FAQ for cypherpunks.  
Fantastic book.  Cough up the money for it...
