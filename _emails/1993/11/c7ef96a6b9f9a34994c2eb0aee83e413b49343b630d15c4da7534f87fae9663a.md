Quite.  From _Point Blank: Guns & Violence in America_ by Dr. Gary Kleck:

   "Like noncriminals, however, criminals do many things that are casually
    or only weakly motivated.  Indeed, much crime is impulsive or
    opportunistic, with criminals committing some crimes only if it
    requires little effort and entails little risk (Feeney 1986)."

Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon
the act of depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest.
