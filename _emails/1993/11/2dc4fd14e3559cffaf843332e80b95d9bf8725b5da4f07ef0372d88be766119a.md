The Hatch Act applies only to "partisan" activity (i.e., electoral).
There is, however, a very real question as to whether or not the
activity we've uncovered might violate 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1913, which
prohibits the use of "appropriated funds" for lobbying purposes.
I'm in the process of looking into that.  There's no way to read this
material without concluding that the Bureau was undertaking an
orchestrated, agency-wide lobbying campaign in support of the
"Root Canal" initiative.

BTW, anyone have ideas about that name!?
