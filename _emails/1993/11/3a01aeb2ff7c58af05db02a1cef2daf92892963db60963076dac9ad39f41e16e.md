CP's:

Check out IEEE Computer November 1993, V26,#11 pp 76-78, wherein the Com-
mittee On Public Policy states, among other things, "Very serious consti-
tutional questions exist.  The government's key escrow initiative may violate
the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the US Bill of Rights"

"Better methods already exist...Moreover, encryption software (including
DES and RSA algorighms and the user-ready and popular Pretty Good Privacy
secure message system) is freely downloadable from public networks around
the world."

"Reconsideration is in order.  The administration should halt the intro-
duction of its key escrow system and reconsider this half-baked scheme, 
which was hatched during the previous administration.  And Congress should 
mandate a serious, open, public review of cryptography policy and its
implication for society."

Pretty clear statement of opinion from a body of IEEE, eh?

 -Jim
