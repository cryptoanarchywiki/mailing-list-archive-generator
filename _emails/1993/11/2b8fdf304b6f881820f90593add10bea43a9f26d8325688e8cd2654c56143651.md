interested in this subject to answer some questions.  this is some kind of 
survey.  
	If anyone is interested please answer the following questions and 
	e-mial your answer to me before this Monday (11/22). I really 
	appriciate your help (thank you)


	1. What is your position on the Clintons adminstrations proposal
	    about the Clipper Chip (pro or against)? and Why?



	2. If you oppese it. the  proposal is a voulantary one why do
	      you oppose it? and if it's going to cut down on crime 
	      (as the government claims) why do you oppose it?

	

	3. If you agree with it.  what do you have to say about it being
	     a bottleneck for fast systems? and what about the potential
	     abuse by the Feds.?
