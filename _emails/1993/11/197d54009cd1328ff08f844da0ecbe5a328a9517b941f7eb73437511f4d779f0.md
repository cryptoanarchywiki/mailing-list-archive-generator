   Has anyone else seen this? I got it from another newsgroup, and 
thought that folks here might be interested in seeing this morph of one 
branch of the cypherpunk movement.
   I'm assuming, of course, that it's not a spoof.
   Comments?

interested.

   The brand new cypherwonks list on Majordomo@Lists.EUnet.fi is for
   ambitious, energetic, can-do, hands-on individuals interested in
   general cutting-edge `cyberspatial development' projects such as in
   cryptography, digital cash, and `electronic democracy'.  (A `wonk' is
   slang for a `meticulous detail person'.) The list is both an informal
   gathering place for the technically adept and also a focal point for
   branching off into serious project coordination.  We place a premium
   on membership by technical professionals and try to hone our posts to
   accommodate the busy (who, according to the adage, are those who get
   all the serious work done).  We are inspired by the Internet but
   don't see it as ideal yet and are particularly interested in
   cooperation, building prototypes, forging standards, and `long-term
   incremental evolution' in our designs and goals.  We're also
   intensely interested in following and influencing the technological
   and political developments of the emerging `national cyberspatial
   infrastructure.'

   The list is *not* for political diatribes in the `radical
   libertarian' agenda, e.g.  rants against all forms of government as
   oppressive, corrupt, or evil, or promoting the use of cryptographic
   technologies for subversive activities like tax evasion, black
   marketeering, or evading law enforcement.  The list is *not* for
   discussions of how to manipulate the honest through the use of
   software technologies.  The list is *not* for unconstructive
   negativism against other's proposals.  Above all, we are interested
   in forging a `civilized cyberspace' out of the current `Internet
   wilderness'.

   Historical note: the list was formed as a less ornery, more moderate
   splinter group from the Cypherpunks by J.Helsingius (creator of the
   popular anon.penet.fi anonymizing service) and L.Detweiler (author of
   many FAQs including `Privacy & Anonymity on the Internet).

   A more comprehensive charter is available with the command `info
   cypherwonks' in the message body.
