Sounds like the simple solution is for people everywhere to replace
the low order bits of all of their pictures with good random noise. Image
quality shouldnt suffer drastically and if the random data is replaced
with output from a good cryptosystem then it would be indistinguishable.
So are any people here influential with the authors of any popular
imaging software?
