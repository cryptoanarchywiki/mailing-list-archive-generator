   Do you know how much NSA employees get paid?  I'm wondering, because it
   is certainly _not_ the case in the CIA.  The "analysts" may make somewhere
   between the $30K - $45K range, but that's hardly "good pay" for people
   who are experts on that kind of analysis, especially when they have Ph.D.s.

  Please tell me how much MITRE pays you.  Is your above description a 
  description of MITRE?
