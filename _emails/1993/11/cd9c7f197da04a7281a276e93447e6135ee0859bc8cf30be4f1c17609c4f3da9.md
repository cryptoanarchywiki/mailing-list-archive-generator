Yes... And lets have at least SOMEONE who can have a Mac at HoHoCon
this time.... Last time there was NOBODY that had one.   Yukk!!
whatta bummer....

I am also interested if there is any rave taking place on the weekend
of the HoHoCon.   I sure want to get in some dancing while I'm there
:-)  ....
