    I'm kind of glad not to have just used filter to remove all
    of his posts sight unseen. Better to see, and note their 
    frequency. Sadly when I instantly hit delete for them and their
    replies, there is very little left on the list.

    It's hard to maintain a coherent conversation in the presence
    of his raving.

    Won't he ever run down?

    Sigh

    Bart
