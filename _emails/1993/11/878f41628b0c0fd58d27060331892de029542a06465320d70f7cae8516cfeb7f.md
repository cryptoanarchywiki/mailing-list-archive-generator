>If I remember coorectly it's KerberosV uses an MD5 hash of /dev/mem.

I'm pretty familiar with the most recent iteration of Kerberos V  
(pre-release beta 3).  There is no mention of /dev/mem in any of the  
Kerberos V source code files.

As best as I can tell,  all DES keys and random numbers used by Kerberos  
are ultimately derived from pass-phrases.

The random DES keys produced by the Kerberos administration utilities are  
derived from the KDC master key and some other info (not /dev/mem).  The  
KDC master key is derived from a pass-phrase.

All random numbers used inside the Kerberos runtime library are derived  
from the user's or server's secret DES key.  A user's secret key is  
derived from the user's pass-phase.  A server's secret key is derived from  
a pass-phrase or generated automagically by the Kerberos administration  
utilities mention above.

(all this is assuming you are using the DES encryption option)
