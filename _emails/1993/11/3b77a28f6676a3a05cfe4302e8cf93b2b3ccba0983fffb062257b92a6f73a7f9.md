First, I wasn't talking about the local-loop competition. I was talking about
cable. I don't doubt that in *some* monopoly situations, mere reduction or
elimination of regulation can allow markets to spring up. I just don't
think this is true with regard to telcos and cable.

Secondly, and as I mentioned, there are non-market tactics that a supplier
can use to prevent competition from arising. For example, why should a local
telco decide on its own to be interoperable with, say, the Electric
Company? What market share can a monopoly gain by giving access to
competition? None. It can only *lose* market share.

It's always a mistake to confuse technical feasibility for competition.
What's to prevent the dominant one or two providers (TPC and Cellular,
let's say) from closing out the others by refusing to be interoperable?
