I have an error in my spelling.  I spelled Jerry Berman's name
wrongly as Jerry Berrman.

Major apologies.  And after mentioning him as just 'an eff guy'
in the first message.  <sigh>

I'm sorry to have misspelled your name, Mr. Berman.

***
Everyone, please do a search and replace of Berrman->Berman before
distributing the document any further.
