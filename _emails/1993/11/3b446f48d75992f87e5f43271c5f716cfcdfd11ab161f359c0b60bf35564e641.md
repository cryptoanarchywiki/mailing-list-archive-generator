No, don't use Diskreet. Use my Secure Drive. Beta now if you want it,
and release with source soon. Uses IDEACFB, protects a hd partition and
floppies, takes only 2K ram, and is very fast. Reasonably user-friendly.
You have to create a D: partition to use on a hard drive.

What's the CPU in a Courier? Is the hardware well enough documented
to hack something like this up? I once burned a rom for a friend's
courier, from a file which he had, to give it V.32 instead of just
HST which it previously had. Not sure where the file came from.
An SRAM also had to be installed.
