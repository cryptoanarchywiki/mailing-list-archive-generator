In a _truly_ Open telecommunications architecture, yes; a thousand schools
of thought can flourish. 

I am not, however, convinced that the NII vision equates to something
that is benefitial for one and all. EFF's vision, on the other hand, is
an admirable one nonetheless. 

My sentiment remains steadfast: the government should stay out of
networking altogether.
