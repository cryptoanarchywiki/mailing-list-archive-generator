The following add copy appeared in TIME the other week, in a special gift 
advertising section:

	GIVE THE GIFT OF PRIVACY

	All it takes to eavesdrop on most cordless calls is another
	cordless phone, scanner, or even a baby monitor.  That's why
	every Motorola Cordless Phone features Secure Clear.sup.TM tech-
	nology.  Secure Clear.sup.TM scrambles voices, so all an eavesdrop-
	per hears is garbled noise.
