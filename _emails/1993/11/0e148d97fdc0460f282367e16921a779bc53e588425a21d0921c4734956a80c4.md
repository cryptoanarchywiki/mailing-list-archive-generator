I very strongly disagree. The social, political, and economic impact
of cryptographic techniques is at least as important as the technology
itself. Pure algorithms can be discussed in sci.crypt, after all.
Cypherpunks do not have a common agenda, but we do share an interest
in how the future world will be shaped by cryptographic technology.

Incorrect. You have complete freedom as to your citizenship. Any time that
you choose, you are free to renounce your citizenship, and thereby
reject the contract that citizenship gives you. Naturalized citizens
of a country/government *very* explicitly enter into the contract; those
of you born into citizenship tend to not to think about the subject very
deeply, but basically you are simply being granted the privilege of
skipping the formalisms, on the assumption that you either accept the
contract, or will explicitly opt out.

If you continue to accept the freely-granted citizenship you were born
into, then you are also accepting the entire contract, like it or not.

If you truly reject the contract that U.S. citizenship obligates you to,
with all its positive and negative points, then go ahead and give it up.
Put your money where your mouth is.

Otherwise, accept that citizenship is a two-way street, and work within
that system to change it to your tastes, rather than denying that the
contract even exists.

I completely agree. But this is quite a different subject.
