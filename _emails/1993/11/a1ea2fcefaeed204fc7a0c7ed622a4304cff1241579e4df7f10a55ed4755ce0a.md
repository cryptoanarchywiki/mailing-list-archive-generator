Well, our cover is blown. What more can I say? (Meow.)

My Siamese cat of course is the "S" in S. Boxx, the boxx meaning
litter boxx, of course, and my Havana Brown generally writes as "Black
Unicorn."

They have few problems typing on the keyboard, but working the
trackball has been a chore. For some reason they keep urging me to go
back to a "mouse."
