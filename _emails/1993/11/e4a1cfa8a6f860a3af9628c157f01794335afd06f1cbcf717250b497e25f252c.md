So what you're saying is that you don't want to encrypt the header
because it has a known format which would allow a cracker to surmize
certain info about the plaintext which would facilitate decryption, but
you don't want to leave the header in plaintext because it would convey
information about the file format which would facilitate breaking the
code.

Solution: Perform a one-way hash of the data file and use the result of
the hash to encrypt the header.  Then encrypt the file.  This means that
the file would have to be decrypted before the header could be decoded. 
Breaking the code would therefore be more difficult because the file
format would not be known.

By the way, what encryption algorythm are you using?
