PS: It has been suggested that we attempt an audio feed to California.
My response is that if we can obtain the hardware here we can attempt
it, but I'm not sure how well it will help the meeting move along.

Directions: 

T: Red line to Kendall Sq. Walk away from the Marriott (across the
street). Walk down the road until the next road, Amhurst, and take a
right.  There keep walking.  You will cross Ames St.  Keep walking
forward until you pass the "Great Sail", then bear right.  Walk up the
steps and then keep walking straight.  Follow the signs for 1-115

Bus: #1 to 77 Mass Ave.  Walk up the stairs and follow the signs.

Car: Get to Cambridge.  Find somewhere to park around Mass Ave between
Memorial Drive and Vassar St.  You may want to try an MIT parking lot.
Enter MIT at 77 Mass Ave and follow the signs.
