I have had lunch with both Tim May and Nick Szabo, and can verify that they
simultaneously sat in different seats, wore different clothes, ate
different lunches, and had different quantities of facial hair.

I have, further, had lunch with Perry Metzger on another occasion and will
testify that he is, to the best of my ability to ascertain, neither of the
aforementioned people.
