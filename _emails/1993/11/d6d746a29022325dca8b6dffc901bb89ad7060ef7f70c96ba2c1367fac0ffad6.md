Not that I'm a Windows/NT fan- quite the contrary; although my
employer is the largest NT developer in the world behind Microsoft, I
personally want no part of NT.

NT is presently being evaluated by the NCSC for C2 status.

Absolutely correct. However, I take some comfort from the fact that
Dave Cutler, of VMS fame, was the principal engineer on NT. For all
its (myriad) other faults, VMS is fairly secure out of the box.

NT doesn't have source available. Neither does SunOS. Both support the
same set of "open computing" protocols, so saying NT is closed is
specious at best.

Like the theoretical capacity of an optical fiber, using
source-available OSs as the bedrock for your own secure system is
wonderful in theory but extremely limiting in practice.
