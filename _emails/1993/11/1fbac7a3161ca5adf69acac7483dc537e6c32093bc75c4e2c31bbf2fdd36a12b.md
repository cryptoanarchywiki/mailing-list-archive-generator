(First, sorry for bringing up an old subject, I was at SC93, and now
have 500 messages to surf through)

I read an article in Electronic Engineering Times a while back (summer, I 
think), about some researchers doing encryption with chaos...  they had
two decryption chips (I think they used DSPs) that had a synchronized 
chaotic stream going between them, which they both used to [en,de]crypt
the data...  

This seems kind of silly, since (assuming an intelligent adversary),
they could just tap the chaotic flow, and start listening...

Am I missing something?
