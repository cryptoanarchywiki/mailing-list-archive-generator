Case in point: sendmail.  The sendmail code is something like a nucleon,
in that one can apparently obtain an arbitrary number of bugs by putting
sufficient energy in.

ViaCrypt's market is people who want unquestioned legality as well
as decent security.  The best way to get this is to use PGP 2.3a,
with source, while holding a license to a product producing
identical output.  Conveniently, editing the "2.3a" to "2.4" in a
PGP-encrypted file causes no apparent problems.
