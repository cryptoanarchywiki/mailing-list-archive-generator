Dunno, but if I'd remembered your ID about it three days ago I could
have told you who S.Boxx was :-) ... I found a nasty bug in penet.fi
whereby putting a return-receipt-to line in mail to an na01234-style
ID caused that person's mailer to tell you who they were :-) 

(I did of course tell Julf within 24 hours, and it's now fixed.  He
wasn't too amused at being woken up by a phone call at 1am Finland time ;-) )

However, this isn't to brag; it's to warn anyone with an anon ID to
look through all the mail they've received on their anon accounts (if
they've kept it) and see if any of it has a Return-receipt-to field
in it.  If it does, your ID will have been compromised.  I know a
lot of Mac mailers put these in automatically, so a lot of you might
already have been compromised by accident.
