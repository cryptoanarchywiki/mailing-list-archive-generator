Just to add a data point, chaos seems to be worth a look.  MIT's
Research Lab have created new signal-processors designs based on chaos
theroy for use in secure communication.

They are based on a recent descovery called synchronized chaos, where
a transmitter and receiver synchronize with each other.

I have a photo copy of an article in front of me but (blush) it has
no identifying elements to it.  I will look monday for the original
and post the source.
