Indeed. Here is my modest proposal...

1) Create a second list, call it cypherrants. Initially it should have
   the same membership as cypherpunks.
2) Make the second list unrestricted.
3) Remove the capacity of the pure noise sources to post to
   cypherpunks.
4) Those who wish to be removed from cypherrants can be.

That way, those of us who don't want to listen don't have to, and
those people who want to listen can, and we can have the best of both
worlds.

Perry
