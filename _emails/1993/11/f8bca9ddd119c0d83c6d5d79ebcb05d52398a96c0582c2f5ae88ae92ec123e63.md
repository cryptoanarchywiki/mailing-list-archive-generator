The recent discussions of tapping modem transmissions reminds me of
a scrap of data I saw about Caller ID [the service provided by the 
phone company that displays the caller's phone number whenever your
phone rings]. Supposedly, the phone company transmits the caller's 
number as a burst of 1200 or 2400 baud ASCII between the first and
second rings; if your modem is set up 'just right,' you can capture
the number with a PC.

[Sorry there is so little data to go on; this tidbit appeared on a 
PC bulletin board and there was no follow-up discussion.]

Does anyone here know more about this? I would dearly love to set up a
program on the PC in my basement that could capture Caller ID data and
log it in a database. Obnoxious callers (Olan Mills, local telemarketers,
etc.) could be identified easily, and I could program the modem to pick
up / hang up on those calls. Then, I could ignore the phone until the
third ring; my PC would automatically dispose of nuisance callers as soon
as the Caller ID data was processed. Also, I'd build up a database of 
names and phone numbers important to me - maybe I'd spend less time 
scrounging my pile of Post-It notes looking for phone numbers.
