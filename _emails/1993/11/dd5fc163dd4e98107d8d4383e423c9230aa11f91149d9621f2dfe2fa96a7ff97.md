Good question. I just checked a terse history of machine translation,
and it didn't mention any version of this. I suspect that its origin
was as a hypothetical example of the kinds of problems that can arise,
and that it didn't actually happen in any real life situation. Examples
like that have always been common in linguistics papers on such subjects.
