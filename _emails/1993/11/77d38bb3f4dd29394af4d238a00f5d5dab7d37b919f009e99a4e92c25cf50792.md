I may be able to. As in, I have a TCP/IP access and a very large
account. Is listserv large? Will I get shot if I install it, I wonder.
I've been told that any software I want to run I can install it myself,
so I _guess_ this means I could run a mailing list......

I'll talk it over with sysadmin, I think.   :-/
