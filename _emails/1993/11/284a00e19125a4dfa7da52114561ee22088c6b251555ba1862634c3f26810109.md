Mr. Szabo objects to my pseudopool fun. I don't understand. How is
misattribution of quotations different than than things like
pseudospoofing and pseudopools that top cypherpunks promote?

I did call Medusa. Her line was been busy. All I have been able to talk
to are tentacles. And they all say, `Believe, me, I am a person!'

yes, Medusa is quite confused lately. Halleluja for RISKS.

Your days are numbered, Medusa, and you are pretty clueless for not
realizing it. The King is Dead.

Attention everyone, this is precisely what Medusa is doing with me
right now. Be careful.

Medusa has finally gone totally insane.

Hey Medusa -- do you allow pseudospoofing on your secret mailing list?
or do you ban it? are you a hypocrite? are you a liar?
