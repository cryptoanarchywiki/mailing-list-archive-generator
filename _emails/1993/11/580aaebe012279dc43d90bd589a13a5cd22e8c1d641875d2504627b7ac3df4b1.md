I've never really made clear what is OK to do with cypherpunks list
material and what is not.  The answer is easy:

	Do whatever you want with it.

Hal Finney runs an encrypted cypherpunks list which sends you an
encrypted version of the main list.  Great.  If someone wants to
create edited or digested versions, fine by me.

If someone wants to create an LD-free list, it's OK by me.  In fact,
those who for whatever reason still pay by the message may want a
ranter-free list just to cut down their charges.

If you think you don't have the resources to do stuff like this
yourself, that's incorrect.  The cypherpunks remailer can be hacked to
run all sorts of email services out of a user account.  If you want
some special feature in the mailing list, do it yourself or convince
someone to do it for you.  If you want some feature and will not be
doing the implementation, feel free to ask on the main list for
someone to do it.

Eric
