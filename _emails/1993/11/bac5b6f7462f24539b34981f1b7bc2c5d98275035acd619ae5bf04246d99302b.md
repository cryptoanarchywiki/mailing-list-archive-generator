In the November 29, 1993 issue of Time Magazine, opposite p. 67, there is an
interesting ad:

> Give the Gift of Privacy
> 
> All it takes to eavesdrop on most cordless calls is another
> cordless phone, scanner or even a baby monitor.  That's why
> every Motorola Cordless Phone features Secure Clear (TM)
> technology. Secure Clear (TM) scrambles voices, so all an
> eavesdropper hears is garbled noise.
> 
> Motorola
> 
> Motorola and Secure Clear are trademarks of Motorola, Inc.
> (C) 1993 Motorola, Inc.
