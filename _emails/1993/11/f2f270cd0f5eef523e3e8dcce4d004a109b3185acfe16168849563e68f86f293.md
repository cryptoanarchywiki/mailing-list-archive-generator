Queer people are used to codes and semiotic communication, we are 
pretty good at steganographic social posturing too.
On ething I've found though is a definite trend not to volunteer as guinea
pigs for social agendas beyond attaining the basic rights now denied us.

Oh, and I'm not so sure that a vocal queer constituency is all that
helpfull these days :-)

As I understand it the few Gay-Lesbian bookstores who are commited to the cause
just drive over the border to pick up their shipments, and then smuggle them
back.

besides introducing a doubling effect on the physical production process
would probably not be worth the expense for that market when simpler
methods suffice.

This could be like waving a red flag in the face of a psychotic bull.
Giving the Gummint an excuse to claim probable cause due to contraband
sexually explicit material just doesn't sound like a good idea to me?

There are plenty of issues regarding abuse of this network by psychopathic
e-terrorist, most of 'em directly analogous to this lists current
controversial bad-boy. I for one, would much rather see some attention to
methods of dealing with that!
