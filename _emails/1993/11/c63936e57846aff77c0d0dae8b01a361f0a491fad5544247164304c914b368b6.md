This is kind of off-topic, but I thought the classic three-person cell was
as follows:

				A
			       / \
			      B - C
			     /     \
			    D       G
			   / \     / \
			  E - F   H - I

where a line shows cell membership.  So A commands a cell of himself, B and
C but knows no one below.  A is either the leader, or is known by one member
above.  B knows D is the leader of another cell, but does not know who E and
F are (or even if they exist).  Similarly for C.

This organization is vulnerable in two ways: any one person can give up
three others; and the chain can be followed (e.g. compromising B can lead to
compromising D and then to E, etc.).  Because information has to flow
between the cells, there is potential for compromise.

I can't think of a way around this problem.  If information flows from B to
E, either B must know of E's existence or non-existence.

Try not to have a good time ... This is supposed to be educational.
