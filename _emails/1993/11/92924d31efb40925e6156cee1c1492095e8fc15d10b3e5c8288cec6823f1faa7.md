I wouldn't want to charge for these services since that would introduce a 
conflict of interest, profit.  I want to be trusted based on my stated policy.
The suggestion of purchasing a ViaCrypt copy of pgp is valid.  

As for automation, it would not be all that "automatic."  It would simply 
comprise tools to issue "Certificates" so that people can show other people to
indicate that my signature on their key is trustworthy.

Comments are welcome.
