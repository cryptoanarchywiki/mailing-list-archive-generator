Well InterNex is hooking people up via ISDN using PPP.  This is a full
56 kbps link with domain name registration, and nntp feed for $150/month
(plus your ISDN bill which will run $28/month + $.01 per minute)
I have this installed in my house (nexsys.net) and it's great, there's
never any need to leave my Sun at home, except for meetings and such,
if your interested you can ftp their stuff from ftp.internex.net.
