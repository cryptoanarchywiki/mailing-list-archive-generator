Because they're trivial to write.  I could do one in less that 15 minutes.

Because very few people can be bothered driving half way across the
country to deliver the OTPs.  It's *way* too much hassle for day to
day use of the kind we use pgp for.  And if someone *is* doing it
for real security (like say AT&T shipping around their secure phone
circuit diagrams because they don't trust clipper :-) ) then they're
*not* going to be mentioning it in passing on usenet news groups...

PS No, you *don't* send them in the mail.  But you knew that, right?
