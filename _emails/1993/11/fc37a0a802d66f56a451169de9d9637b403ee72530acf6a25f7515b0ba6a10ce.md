 Unfortunately, your netcom account also won't change when you change
 internet vendors.  What everyone should have is their own domain name;
 netcom offers this service (a la david@sternlight.com) for, I think,
 $45/month.

 Anyone who's interested in a better deal might like to check out
 internet.com who offer your own domain (and a single user id) for
 $75/year.  You get your mail rewritten by them to your ordinary
 account elsewhere (eg tcmay@netcom.com) and can move the domain with
 you should you ever be dissatisfied with internet.com's service.
 
 Apologies, btw, for not talking about code, but I guess if Perry
 hasn't flamed Tim yet he's not going to flame me for posting this
 either :)

 I'd be more thrilled if they were doing what demon do and putting
 people's own sites on the net under SLIP for a flat rate (with demon
 it's 10 pounds per month - call it 15 bucks) and just ordinary phone-
 call costs on top.  [If netcom now does this, apologies - it's been
 some time since I looked into the US slip culture]

 This *is* a cypherpunks related goal IMHO, because everyone having
 their own site at home rather than just using their PCs as terminals
 to systems like netcom means they can *much* more easily integrate
 pgp into their routine mailing life.  (Uploading and downloading
 pgp mail is such a hassle for some people - like prz himself - that
 they just don't do it...)
