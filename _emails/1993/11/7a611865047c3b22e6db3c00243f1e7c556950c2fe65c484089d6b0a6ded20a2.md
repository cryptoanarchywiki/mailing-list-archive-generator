Ok...I'll desist after a brief comment: I actually don't disagree with
any of the major points you make when you put it that way -- although
some of the other things I call minor points you might call major points :-)

I think I do have some quibbles which would probably turn *into* serious
disagreement, but even I would say that raising those things would take us
far afield, so I'll leave it at that.

P.S. This is ad hominem...tsk, tsk:
