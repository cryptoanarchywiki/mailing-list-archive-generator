 This is all good encouraging stuff!  Of course you realize that half the
 issue is that PunkNet and some other things HAVE to be *Illegal*.  Why?
 Because they have no point in existing if they can be regulated, taxed,
 interferred with or "policed" (an abstract) by any govt or comm agency

 This is an excellent idea.  Get the HAM crowd into it (The ULTRAnerds)

 In MUDS (eg. Graphical muds!!) I think it would become easier than ever to

 Encyphered PunkNet too
