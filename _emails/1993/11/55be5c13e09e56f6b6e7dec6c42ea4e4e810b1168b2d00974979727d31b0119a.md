The December Dr. Dobb's Journal has an editorial on the current PGP 
legal wrangling.  I'll quote the last sentence:

    More importantly, the First Amendment guarantees us the right
    to speak in an encrypted way and insidious attempts to douse
    public access to cryptography, cloaked under the guise of
    software-export investigations, appear to stifle these rights.

opinions, one of which is "disclaimers are a good thing".
