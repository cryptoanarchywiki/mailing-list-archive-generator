I don't know if this is particularly true but you can purchase modems
that recognize caller-id and distinctive ring data.  The caller-id
information is printed between the RING and CONNECT strings.  In
particular, I have re-written the UNIX getty program in order to take
these strings and put them in an environment variable before calling
login.  Since the getty actually uses ATA to answer the phone rather
than setting S0=1, we have considered building a database of known
troublemakers' phone numbers and then have getty let the phone ring
away to NO CARRIER when said tarbs call.  ZyXEL makes such a modem.
