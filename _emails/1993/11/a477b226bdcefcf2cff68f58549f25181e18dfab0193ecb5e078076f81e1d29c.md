L. Detweiler is a champion of democracy.  He has argued strongly
for it here on this forum.  I am not a supporter of democracy.
A crowd of people has no greater rights than one person.  L. Detweiler
disagrees with this.  I shall confront this disagreement with an
example that strikes to its core.

 I propose a vote.  This vote will have no time limit.  If at any
point you wish to change your vote you are free do so.  This vote
is non-binding on those who do not support democracy.  This vote
will be conducted publicly on this list. 

=======================================================================
VOTE: Proposition desist

  L. Detweiler will cease posting to the cypherpunks mailing list.  He
will no longer concern himself with the activities of those on the
cypherpunks mailing list here or on any other forum.

                    [I support]/[I Do not support]
=======================================================================

L. Detweiler will be the only judge of the results of this vote.  If
he believes a majority of unique individuals carry this proposal one
way or another, then by his honor and support for democracy he is
bound by it.  If he recants his support for democracy, then he is not
bound by it.

------------------
I shall cast my vote here:  I support Proposition desist.
