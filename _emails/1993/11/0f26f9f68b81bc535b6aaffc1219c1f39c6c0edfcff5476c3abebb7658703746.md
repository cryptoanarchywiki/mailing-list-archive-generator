Apparently, information-theoretically, there is a limit to the
bandwidth available in any given area of space before overlapping
of signal occurs.  

While I don't agree that it is likely to occur soon, eventually
we will hit an information bottleneck; probably somewhere after
we manage to use subquantal particles as signal-carriers.

Our current system would, indeed, allow people to fax themselves
regularly; in fact, I occasionally fax things to myself already.
However, when people start doing genuinely exotic things, such
as emailing their entire genome to their doctor; or emailing
vast files on self-administered MRI tests to the hospital;
or transmitting graphical images of components for something
as simple as factory work; then we'll seriously have to think
about theoretical bandwidth limitations.

However, with any luck we'll be off the planet, and will have
the infinite bandwidth we need by the time we need it.
