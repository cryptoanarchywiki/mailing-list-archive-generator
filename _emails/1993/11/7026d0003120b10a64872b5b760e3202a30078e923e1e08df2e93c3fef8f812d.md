Um, minor correction: There are four base pair combinations, and each
can be represented by two bits.

Frankly, if I had the kind of technology to easily sequence my entire
geneome, I doubt I'd be content to just look at it.  I'd probably be
saying, "Hmm.. I don't like that gene, it might give me heart desease,
I'll just use a modified retrovirus to substitute a better one..." :)
Maybe one day genetic identification tests won't be so accurate as they
are today.
