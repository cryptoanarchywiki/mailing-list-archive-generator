if every single site knows the final address, so what?
 how is this going to help them track down the original sender??

anyone at the final destination who wants to track down the original sender
would need to hop-scotch backwards through the numerous sites and try to
track down the path the message took. this is of course, IF someone really
wants to go to this much trouble and if they think they can talk a slew
of administrators into helping them with the witchhunt.

1 out of 5 odds that a "special processing script" is executed on the
message and it is forwarded through a remailer or two using encryption.
 just set up 20 different scripts that route the message in encrypted form
through various/random/secret/obscure remailer-paths.
