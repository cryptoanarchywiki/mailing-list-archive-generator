In my experience, mass key-signing on a few laptops is a waste of  
time.  It might be a fun waste of time at a convention, but it made  
the one Washington Cypherpunk meeting to date kind of a drag.  Far  
more efficient is to print up a paper certificate with your key and  
its fingerprint, run off a bunch of copies, and sign them.  Pass them  
out and let people verify your credentials; everyone does a batch  
signing when they get some free time.  Then everyone mails their key  
ring to a server, waits a few days, and collects all their new  
signatures off the same server.

But, again, maybe that takes the fun out of it.  To each his own...

Joe
