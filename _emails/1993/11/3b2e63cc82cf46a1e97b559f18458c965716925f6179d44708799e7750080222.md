I hate to be the bringer of bad news, but to the best of my knowledge
Switzerland no longer allows numbered bank accounts.  Also, from
my studies of international banking, bank secrecy and tax havens,
I have never seen any reference to numbered bank accounts in 
any country other than Switzerland, including Liechtenstein (although
Liechtenstein does have better secrecy safeguards than Switzerland.
Today, Cayman Islands has more international money in its bank than
any other country in the world due to their bank secrecy and favorable
tax status (ref: Forbes Magazine).
