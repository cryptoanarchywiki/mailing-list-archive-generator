Not a good idea.  The material from Mike was pretty good, but whoever did
that also forwarded some solidly afactual material from P.Metzger
pretending to be a telecom lawyer.  There's no telling how many sysops
are going around thinking they are common carriers now, and who are
utterly mistaken.  This may take quite a bit of doing to clean up.   
A better tactic would be to write an article, then pass it on to people
that know what they are talking about for some editorial review, THEN send
it to the Snooze.
<No offense meant to Perry; he knows plenty about some things, but an
attorney he ain't. :>
