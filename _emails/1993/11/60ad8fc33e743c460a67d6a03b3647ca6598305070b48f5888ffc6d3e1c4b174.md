fine. it was late. i wasn't thinking clearly. shut up. i don't wanna hear it.
 
this idea would work fine if you happen to have a clue where the hell the
abusive/annoying messages are comming from ...
 
how about just switching that around to be a "lock out these sites" list
and ignore all messages that ask to be remailed to those sites.
 
and be sure to stick "willy@whitehouse.gov" on the top of the list.
