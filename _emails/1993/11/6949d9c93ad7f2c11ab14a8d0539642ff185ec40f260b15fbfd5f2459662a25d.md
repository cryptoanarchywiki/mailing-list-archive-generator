Having just been informed that I'm to undergo this procedure in 4 days
time, I really really appreciate you telling me that it hurts.

Seriously, I think "Root Canal" must mean what it says.  Root Canal. A
canal is a channel, a pathway.  Root, in unix terminoligy means one who
can read anything on a system.  Thus Root Canal would allow the FBI to
have a channel with full read privilages to all information in a system,
namely the phone system.  Root Canal therefore is the same as Big Brother
in Orwellian terminology.
