Hm.. there have been some concerns over anonymous mail recently...
both Alan and Thomas have noted that it is easy to match up sender and
destination for a remailer which processes each message as it arrives.

Solution: cache all messages and process them later (once a day, once
a week, etc.).  For example, the remailer at elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu
caches all incoming requests, and processes them (randomly) at
midnight.

I didn't even have to modify the remailer scripts to do this; rather,
I wrote some extra ones.  The process seems stable.  The trickiest
part is scheduling the remailing: I have to use the 'at' command since
I can't have my own crontab.

Also, Thomas mentioned what seems to be 'random remailing'.  As I
mentioned in a previous message ("ANON: anonymous mail"), forcing mail
to progress through a network randomly also forces the final
destination to be known to everybody, where before only one site knows
the final destination.

Also, instead of building the necessay headers to hop mail you may be
able to use one of several scripts and programs available at
soda.berkeley.edu
