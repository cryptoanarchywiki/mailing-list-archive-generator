Guys, I'd like to ask you if you've seen any of my posts since Thursday
night.  If you have, they weren't from me, as I've been unable to log in
to my account since then.  Please forward them to me in email.

One of two things has happened.  a) I goofed and changed my password to
something I forgot, or b) someone got into my account somehow.  b) may
be possible since I found the data on one of my directories has changed
and I'm not sure if it's just the system`s time that`s wrong...

Anyhow, I've had the sysadmin set me a new password so here I am again.





{% endraw %}
