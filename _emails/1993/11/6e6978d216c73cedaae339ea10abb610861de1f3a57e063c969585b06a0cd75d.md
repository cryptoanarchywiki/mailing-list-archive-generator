| Since IDEA was developed outside the US, doesn't that mean it there 
| essentially is no exporting of cryptography going on here?  To be 
| perfectly invulnerable, the code could be distributed internationally
| without any encryption algorithm--simply add the crypto you want that
| is easily obtainable.

Actually, there are several operatib system products that do exactly that.
Ex: X Windows, BSD

| (Of course, selling crypto is the real trigger for getting attention.
| A copy-left certainly isn't selling.)

Actually, this highlights the absurdity of the old Cold War rules.
