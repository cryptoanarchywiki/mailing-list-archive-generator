I personally disagree with censorship. It would be impossible to enforce
anyway. A move of this type would simply drive Detweiler to use the
Cypherpunk remailers which would be harder to detect. Then what do we do?
Stop accepting mail from our own remailers?

Look again, that WAS Detweiler, posing as "Psychopunk" (the same Anon id-
an12070@anon.penet.fi - that S.Boxx and "The Executioner" have been using)
trying to bait someone into doing something illegal, and to get the
reaction you just gave. The twisted f*ck is now plotting against himself.

People should be on the lookout, btw. I wouldn't put it past him to try
past him to try to use any of these ideas against others. He's obviously
been thinking about how to screw with other peoples lives remotely.

>5. If you don't like what he says then kill the mail and forget it.

I agree. Besides, after getting past my initial anger, I realized that
Detweiler's posts are funnier than Gary Larson's 'Far Side' cartoons.

I feel safer when he's posting long e-mail messages anyway, at least then
he's not doing anything else. And the more he posts, the lower his
credibility gets.
