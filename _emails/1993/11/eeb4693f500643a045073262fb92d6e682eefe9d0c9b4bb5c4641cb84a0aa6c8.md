About a year ago my wife got a phone call from a stranger claiming to believe
he had gone to high school with her, but he wasn't really sure.  After
a whole song and dance he finally said, nonchalantly, "Well, gee, what was 
your mother's maiden name?"

Since her mother's maiden name was not, "Fuck you, asshole", I gathered 
from those words that she had figured out his scam. 

Who knows who he was. We immediatley changed all maiden-name passwords to
something more obscure and less socially-engineerable.
