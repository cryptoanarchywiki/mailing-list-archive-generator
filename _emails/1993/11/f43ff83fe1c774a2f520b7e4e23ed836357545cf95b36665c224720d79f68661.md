I don't know who wanted to start reposting Sternlight posts to this list,
but I have a good way in my news reader to avoid mail from him or in 
reply to him or talking about him -- but lack such facilities in my 
mail reader.  Could any message mentioning Sternlight or reacting to
something he said (however indirectly) include his name in the subject line
so that I can kill it without reading?

Thank you.

 - Carl
