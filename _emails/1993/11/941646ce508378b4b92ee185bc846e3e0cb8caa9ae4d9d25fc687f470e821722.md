in the "PC" world, look for DISKREET (with Norton's Utilities).

it simple, "Stacker"-like, and user friendly.

it seems to offer "feeble DES"
              and "even more feeble DES"

it's speed is almost negligable when in use.
 (which doesn't say very much for the "stength" of the encryption.)


ObInTheSameVein?:

anyone ever thought of taking a "software MNP" program
and creating a "V42enc" software modem protocol?

auto-generate unique/random keys after the connection is etablished,
allow for "re-training" the connection by generating/switching to a new
key. maybe re-train every "set number of seconds" ...

pick a "fast" encryption method, and a RSA public key length that is
proportional to the strength of the encryption, and have at it.

talk about "just like uncle sam does it!" ...


If the NSA is paranoid over PGP, what will they think of plug in pirate
PROMS for USR Couriers that will create obscenely secure connections?
 (although the encrypted connections might not fly along at full speed,
  that tis but a small price to pay...)
