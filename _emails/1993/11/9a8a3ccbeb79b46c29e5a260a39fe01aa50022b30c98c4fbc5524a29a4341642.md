The beauty of cypherpunk technology is that it provides means to _avoid_
the tyranny of government, rather than trying to redirect that tyranny
on behalf of one's own ends.

Government gets its power from its hundred million clients.  To join
that clientele is not consistent with wanting government power to
whither away.
