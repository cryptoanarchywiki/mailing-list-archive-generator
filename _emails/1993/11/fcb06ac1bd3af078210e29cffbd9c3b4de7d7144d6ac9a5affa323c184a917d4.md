It should be evident; at least I'm convinced. The recent discussion on
programs to automatically search for similarities in texts of
different authors led me to think back on the collected works of
Detwiler and Boxx.

This is not sufficient evidence to stand up in court (or in the RISKS
Digest), but I offer it for your consideration.  There are some unique
and characteristic signatures in material from both authors:

	- writing style: frequency of use of $10 words
	                 excessive use of modifiers
			 excessive use of parenthetical phrases
	- lack of periods between initials and names (e.g. "T.C.May")
	- consistent use of initials instead of names (see above; no
	  other entity on this list that I recall does so.)
	- ADJECTIVES and ADVERBS are capitalized for emphasis

So, L.Detwiler: are you the snake, or just a tentacle? Of course,
maybe S. Boxx is just Eric pretending to be Tim, who is pretending to
be you. Or, maybe it's those damn Libertarian Nazi abortionists. I
don't know.
