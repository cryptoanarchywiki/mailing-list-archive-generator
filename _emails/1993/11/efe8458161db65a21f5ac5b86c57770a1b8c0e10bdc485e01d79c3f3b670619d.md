I have been proud to be able to keep out of the fight with
L.D., but this is a personal accusation. I'll just deny that
I am a Dorothy Denning admirer and leave it at that. I also
never wondered, on the list, if someone found a way to thwart
PGP and read everyone's mail on the sly, but what of it,
that is something to consider if we want to rely on it for
privacy.
