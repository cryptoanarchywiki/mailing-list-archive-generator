Cypherpunk technology gives you a way to _forget about reducing their
power_ and concentrate on increasing your own.

Without the hundred million each clamoring to shape government as he
would prefer, it would wither.  Of course, if you alone stop clamoring,
it won't have a noticeable effect, but at least you avoid the
inconsistency and cognitive dissonance of contributing to the very
problem you're attempting to solve.

You're patronizing them by entertaining their claim to control the means
by which you will communicate, implicitly endorsing the proposition that
there's some legitimacy to their involvement in the first place.

I agree.  This is one of the reasons for _avoiding_ government, rather
than fighting them or joining them.

Are you willing to wait?

Why do you care about the couch potatoes?  Are you suggesting that your
privacy, or your use of strong cryptography, should be hostage to their
approval?

Asking the couch potato for his permission is exactly the act that makes
him think that his permission is required.  This is an instance of what
I mean when I write that the power of government results from its
hundred million clients.  If you insist on asking government for
permission to use your pencil sharpener they will gladly enlarge their
power enough to deny you that permission.

Leave the sleeping couch potato lie, and he'll be much less bother.

I don't mean to do that.  I'm just pointing out that playing in their
tar-pit -er, sandbox legitimizes their claim to control.
