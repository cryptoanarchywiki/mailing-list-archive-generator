I am a bit concerned about the cypherpunks list. I posted something
to the list with the subject "All our eggs in one basket," that I
believe is a real concern for cypherpunks. The posting has prompted
a lot of personal correspondence, and maybe even a co-authorship on
a paper if we can find a place willing to include a nym as an
author. A few of you wrote me back messages complimenting my post.

What worries me is that nobody has continued the discussion on the
list, whereas the posts by L.D. and S. Boxxx seem to generate a lot
of heated discussion. If my post was really not as important as
those, then maybe I'm in the wrong mailing list. I think I'll post
a copy of that message to sci.crypt where people are interested in
real crypto issues.
