I haven't seen this newsletter myself, though I knew Jim Bennett was
writing up something along these lines. Jim attended our first
physical Cypherpunks meeting, in the fall of 1992, and may even still
be reading this list. (Jim?)

Ironically, Jim was one of the folks who first heard about "crypto
anarchy" in the summer of 1988, at the home of Phil Salin and Gayle
Pergamit. I spoke to a group of around a dozen and got a good
reaction. One of the listeners, Dave Ross, came up with the "anonymous
escrow service," the escrow agent "Esther" who his mutually anonyous
to both Alice and Bob, but who is motivated to be an honest broker by
reason of this anonymity. (Simply, an escrow agent is interested in a
continuing revenue stream set by reputaion...this is why most
businesses "work" even when in most cases they could theoretically
rip-off or "burn" their customers.)

It's gratifying to now see the word spreading. Speaking of which, you
should all be aware that the "Wired" piece on "Crypto Rebels" is
available online from the "infobot" service at "Wired." To retrieve
it, send a message to "infobot@wired.com" and in the _body_ of the
message (which should be otherwise blank) include this line:

GET 1.2/features/crypto-rebels

There is a whole command set, and index of articles, available. I
believe the simple messages HELP and INDEX are the ones you want.

(P.S. I don't think case matters, so HELP or help should both work.)
