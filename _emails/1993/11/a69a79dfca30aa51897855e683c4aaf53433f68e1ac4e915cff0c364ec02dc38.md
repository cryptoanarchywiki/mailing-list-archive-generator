Nonsense.  Spend a little time with Mr. Dictionary, and you should be able
to adduce the meaning of the word "censorship".  It isn't what you seem to
think it is.

On the other hand, if you truly feel the way you do, please let me have a
copy of your house key and warn your Significant Other that I'll be
dropping by for an extended snuggle.  I'll also help myself to your stereo
and VCR while I'm there.

What?  You don't _like_ that idea?

You wouldn't want to _censor_ me, would you?

Read the First Amendment.  Learn something about free speech.  It would
assist you in weaning yourself away from sounding like an uninformed fool.
