Something of import, and something you can DO.  Please see note at end.

NEED STATISTICS ON LOST CRYPTO SALES

The Software Publishers Association (SPA) has been working to bring
about the liberalization of export controls on mass market software
with encryption capabilities.  SPA's much-publicized study of the
foreign availability of cryptographic products has clearly
demonstrated the widespread and easy availability of encryption
that is stronger than what U. S. firms have been able to export.
However, NSA claims that software companies have not demonstrated
sufficiently the economic harm they have suffered from export
controls.  Congress has told us that without better economic harm
statistics, our chances of liberalizing the export laws are slim.
Therefore, WE NEED YOUR HELP.

If you or your firm has lost business because you have not been
able to export your encryption product, please let us know.  Be as
specific as possible.  It is the cumulative effect of this
information that will be most compelling.

Please pass this on to those in your firm who might know about
these matters or might also be able to respond.

Please send replies to i.rosenthal@applelink.apple.com or to
