You can't with the partial protocol I've described thus far, but
assuming that you have to do something like signing the digital draft
in order to spend it, the bank's failure to provide a signed copy of
the draft with your signature demonstrates that you haven't spent the
money. The arbitrator needn't care if you already got the cash -- he
can order the bank to send you another copy of the draft that they
sent you.

I must admit that I haven't worked out the protocols for this yet, but
from the sketches I've made I think a quite workable system is
practical. I don't think you can cover all forms of cheating by the
bank, but I think you can construct things such that if someone tries
to cheat you you can prove it.
