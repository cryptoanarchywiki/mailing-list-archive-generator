I agree, background is the key. 

This whole conversation about Nyms, pseudospoofing, etc. is interesting.
>From DAY ONE of me using a computer/modem/BBS/EMAIL in 1983 all I ever knew
was to use a handle/pseudonym. On the underground BBS systems, using a real
name or even a real-sounding name (even if it was a handle) would cause a
good deal of suspicion and would make getting verified for full access
difficult. I am constantly amazed how people routinely use their
real names in conversations over the internet. I don't judge them however, I
don't think they are stupid either, its just DIFFERENT than the way I am 
used to operating.

The complete opposite viewpoint seems to be prevalent among those who have
been using the internet for years -- before the general public started to
overrun it. Those people have been accustomed to communicating with people
who seemed to be real, at least they had real sounding names. Now an
increasing number of pseudo-entities are appearing on the Internet. Some are
disturbed by this. To me, its more like "what took so long". 

With irresponsible people sending mail bombs, using personal information 
from 'finger' to harass people they don't agree with, etc. it isn't hard to
see why some people have reservations about various anonymous or pseudo-
anonymous entities. The problem lies in the fact that creating a new identity
on the internet either by creating additional user accounts or through the
use of anonymous remailers is so easily accomplished that the concept of
trust and reputation has been eroded. This is different from my background
whereas reputation was essentially EVERYTHING and the creation of a new
identity that allowed one to use desirable systems/services (ie, 'elite'
systems) took long periods of time. The benefit of this type of social
structure was that it naturally kept abuse, deception, and harassment to
a minimum. 

I am not sure what my ultimate point is (as you may have surmised by now)
other than there are inherent differences in each Internet user's background
just as there are cultural differences among races in real life. There 
unfortunately will always be some prejudice against those who are different.
Isn't a lot of energy saved simply by basing judgement on what others SAY
and DO rather than what they LOOK LIKE or in this case, what their
'name' or 'nym' is?
