<sigh> nobody is interested in preventing pseudospoofing here. the
people who have most maneuvered themselves into a position to aid
future cyberspace are instead constraining it. that's the point, isn't
it? gosh, how could I have been so blind...

as YOU conceive them.

false. There could be a network of `true identity' key servers just as
easily as there is a network of PSEUDOSPOOFED LIES.

the real question, cypherpunks, is what you would do to THWART,
SABOTAGE, and DESTROY any such system or attempt ... (that is, beyond
your current impressive resume)

so, Mr. Keyserver, considering that this (your?) software could be used
TODAY to help build up a true identity system, why do you oppose using
it in that fashion? I mean, besides that you are a Cypherpunk.
