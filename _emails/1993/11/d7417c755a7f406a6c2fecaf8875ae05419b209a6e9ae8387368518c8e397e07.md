Unfortunately, netcom's nearest point-of-presence is a $.10/minute nighttime
long distance call away from me.  So this "free" service would cost me about
$6/hour.  There are several services which provide access via packet-switching
networks which have hundreds of POP's, including some local to me.  Two of
these networks are Sprintnet and Compuserve's network (which is separate from
the Compuserve service itself).  These networks charge $2-$3/hour off-prime,
so they are a better deal.  But the carrying capacity of these networks seems
somewhat limited, and you don't get the full throughput of your baud rate.

There are resources available on the net, the "pdial" and "nixpub" lists,
which provide lists of service providers for Internet access.  I don't have
access information handy....  Well, I just grabbed some info.  Here
is an excerpt from alt.internet.services FAQ:

I check these lists every so often, hoping to find cheaper access, but
still no luck.

But I agree with Graham Toal that a much better setup would be smarter
software on my home PC, with an intelligent protocol for communication with
the net service provider.  I wouldn't care if it was UUCP, POP, SLIP, or
whatever, at this point; it's probably better than semi-automated ZMODEM.
I hope that these facilities become more widely available at a price of
around $20-$30 a month or less.  Paying hundreds of dollars a month for
these capabilities is far beyond my budget.  I can't understand why England
is so far ahead of the U.S. in this regard.  No offense intended, but I
always thought of their telecommunications and computing infrastructure as
being several years behind the U.S.
