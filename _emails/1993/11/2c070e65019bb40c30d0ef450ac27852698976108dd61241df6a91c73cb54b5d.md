Gee, Perry, too bad for you, but it isn't *your* list, either. You
are assuming you speak for the list in your response. You're no spokesman.
This list is as unmoderated as any newsgroup. Your tastes have no
enforcement power.

Arthur can and will post about whatever he likes.

Tell you what...for the sake of all of us newcomers, why not quote the
initial charter? Perhaps it would help us all focus. That could be
a good thing.

If no one does so, then you can expect people to continue posting about
their own personal interests, whether or not it matches your view
of appropriateness.
	Doug
