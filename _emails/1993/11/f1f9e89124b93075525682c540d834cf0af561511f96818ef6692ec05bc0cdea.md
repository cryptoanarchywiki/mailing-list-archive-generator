There is a number of modems that will do this for you automatically.
The Supra comes to mind, and I believe the Zyxel also does it.

I do have the specs for CID somewhere, but off the top of my head I
don't recall how it is transmitted.

There was an intersting thread in comp.dcom.telecom about something
called the "Presto Chango!" box, that transmits bogus CID information
after the call is answered, so you can easily confuse most CID boxes
in the market.
