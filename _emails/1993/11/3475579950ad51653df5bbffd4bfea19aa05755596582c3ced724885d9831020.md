"Officially" associated with Cypherpunks? I don't know about where you 
are but in most places in this country there is no "Official Cypherpunks 
Organization." This LIST is the original basis of the Cypherpunks. From 
there, some people who have other interested parties in their locales 
have gone on to form local groups. This isn't like the Extropians who 
have the Extropy Institute officially behind them.

Why bother?

What is the "CypherPunks" you are refering to if not this list? All 
mailing lists are, by the very nature, semi-private forums. You have to 
ask to get on them. If someone is disruptive, I see no reason they should 
not be asked to leave. Of course, the idiot in question isn't even on the 
list anymore. If you aren't the list, the list shouldn't accept your 
postings and mail them to members. I see no reason why non-members of the 
list should be able to mailbomb us all by sending to the list address.
