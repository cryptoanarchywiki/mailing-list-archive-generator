Hasn't it occurred to everyone that the local loop is cable and cable is 
the local loop.  There's no difference.  Any way of squishing gobs of 
zeros and ones down a channel to you is the Local Loop and the Trunk and 
the Cable and everything.

In this Age of Open Systems?  Anyway if they won't connect each other, I 
will with my own switch just like International Discount 
Telecommunications and the other companies are smashing the ITU monopoly 
pricing of international phone calls.

Sweden approved 5 national cellular franchises by far the most of any 
country.  Sweden has the most market penetration of cellular by any 
country.  No coincidence.
