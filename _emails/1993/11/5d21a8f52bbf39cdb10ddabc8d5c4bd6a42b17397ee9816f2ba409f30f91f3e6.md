The idea is to encode the important-to-be-trusted features of the software
and the inter-machine protocol handshake together into the equivalent
of a Goedel number which acts as a public key during the protocol handshake,
so that any change to that core encoding of the functionality would have
the side effect that it was no longer able to communicate.

Yeah...I'm having strong difficulties with doing it in a way that is
computationally feasible as well as theoretically sound. Several times
I thought I'd found the right approach but then found holes in it. So
I lied in implying that I really did have a final algorithm....I *thought*
I did, but I was wrong.
