I think the best you can do is to create a secure chroot subshell which
anyone logging in anywhere but from the console gets put into.

[When I wrote such a shell as an experiment, I found it very difficult
to do properly when the system had multiple partitions - I could only
get it to work on a machine that had a single pack.  So if you're starting
from scratch, my suggestion is to use netbsd and start off with your
entire disk on a single partition - don't have the traditional small
root partition.  If you get that far I have some code I can mail you.]
