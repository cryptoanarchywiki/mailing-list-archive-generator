  Let's start a new topic, and mr. deitwieler is not invited.

  Has anyone considered how an organization like The Republic of Desire
from Gibson's _Virtual Light_ novel could be created/formed?

  It seems to me that it would be an excellent example and development motive 
for the crypto-anarchy tools: the DC-net protocol, Zero Knowledge Proofs
used for anonymous credentials, reputation-nets/webs-of-trust, etc. etc.

  My only problem with this is knowing how to organize the 
"guerilla cell structures" or whatever it was he mentioned.  Anyone have
a ref for something that discusses guerilla cell organizations?
