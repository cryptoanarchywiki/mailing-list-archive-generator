Then why have telecoms prices been declining for years?  A three minute 
phone call from the US to England cost $25 in 1955 (in 1955 dollars).  
Where in the current comms spectrum do you see saturation and rising 
prices?

It seems to me that in most resources we get predictions of shortages for 
centuries but those shortages never appear because the market eliminates 
or dodges them.
