My copy of ViaCrypt PGP arrived yesterday (Nov 3).  Since I worked late, I  
haven't had a chance to play with it yet.  I looked through the manual.  The  
commands look similar (if not identical) to "classic" PGP's, as far as I could  
tell at a glance.

The bulk of the text for the manual was taken from the documentation that comes  
with PGP, except all occurances of "PGP" where replaced with "ViaCrypt PGP".

The box looks pretty good. :-)  Looks like they hired a real graphics designer.

I suppose some of you are wondering why I'd fork over 100 bucks for something I  
could get for free.  First of all, I can afford it.  Second of all, I simply  
feel more comfortable using a licensed shinkwrapped software product than a  
quasi-legal freeware one.  Call me a coward.

I realize that by not compiling the code myself on my own machine I basically  
have to trust the ViaCrypt PGP implementation.  So be it.  If there is  
something wrong with ViaCrypt PGP I believe it will eventually be discovered.   
Somebody will no doubt disassemble it and look for backdoors.  If someone finds  
one, ViaCrypt's reputation will be worthless.  It's in ViaCrypts best interest  
not to put in any backdoors.
