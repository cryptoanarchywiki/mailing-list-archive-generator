Some miscellaneous psychopunk (I forget who, they are all 
interchangeable) said
 
<-
 
 
You know, I've been listening to our Mr. Detweiler here for some 
time without voicing much other than the occasional "let's get on 
with more serious business" message to the list.  It wasn't until 
I realized how well Mr. Detweiler fit into a persona archetype I 
recognized that I even thought I'd dignify his posts to the list 
with a response.
 
I guess it was this quotation header that clicked it.
 
- ->
 
Some miscellaneous psychopunk (I forget who, they are all 
interchangeable) said:
 
<-
 
A cynic recognizes the bad in everything and the good in nothing.  
(Or something to that effect.)  Mr. Detweiler seems to have to 
have a face to associate with all of us to consider us distinct.  
While he may consider this "normal" I think it's just behind the 
times.  It seems that Mr. Detweiler is offended by the idea that 
he may not have superficial criteria to judge his associates by 
in the coming decades.  Color of skin, tone of voice, sexual 
preference, this sort of thing.  I think this might make some 
more sense after we look at some more of Mr. Detweiler's quotes.
 
Just consider the percentage of content in his posts that 
actually contains some constructive criticism or commentary, this 
passage is illustrative:
 
- ->
 
wow! a break in the clouds! a breath of fresh air! who is `we'? 
please elaborate! This miscellaneous psychopunk is posting from 
MIT. Do you think his burdensome flesh-cucoon (sic) is in Boston? 
or California?
 
AT LAST! HONESTY! (even if it is criminal or perverted)
 
<-
 
It seems possible that Mr. Detweiler is unable to conduct an open 
debate without resorting to sarcastic and unprofessional barbs.  
His arsenal is obviously reduced with the lack of physical 
characteristics to criticize.
 
Consider:
 
- ->
 
Psychopunks, I'm most impressed with this new atmosphere of open
advocation of pseudoanonymity instead of all the black 
disinformation snippets about `true anonymity' and all the other 
nonsense about it not being widespread, no cypherpunks being 
personally involved, etc. for the dreary 10 months or so I've 
been here. What trouble and heartache for all of us you have 
caused me in pretending it isn't! Finally, they Come Out of the 
Closet. Imagine -- having to hide in your own neighborhood for so 
long. Really, it's all right. There, there.
 
<-
 
Seething with self righteousness and condescending remarks, 
behind a electronic veil just as much as the rest of us, it seems 
Detweiler has little of substance beyond emotional appeals that 
seem to shout "Far right - Lambs of Christ." in their 
methodology.  Given the length, number and intellectual diarrhea 
styles of his posts, it seems Detweiler has little else to do.  
It looks to me as if this goes a long way to explain the need to 
dominate and attract attention.
 
Consider again:
 
- ->
 
When will the articles on Pseudospoofing come out in Wired and 
NYT? Oh, let's see, there's Newsweek and all those other places 
too. Please, tell me, I'm really in a tizzy. I'll have to call 
Mr. Kelly and Mr. Markoff and tell them of your new openness. I'm 
sure they will be quite interested!
 
<-
 
I'd be surprised to find that Mr. Detweiler has not read any Mike 
Royko, he tries so hard to emulate him.
 
 
- ->
 
So, I would like to collect a list of all the Psychopunks who are
PSEUDOSPOOFERS and PROUD OF IT. Please, describe your lovely
techniques, all the pain and victimization you have gone through 
from your tormenters (sic) (like me), and how you are going to 
Change the World so that Pseudospoofers can Live without 
Harassment. `Live and Let Live'. Sort of like Gay Pride
 
<-
 
Mr. Detweiler really throws his hand here.  I suppose we are 
supposed to be insulted with the analogy to the Gay Pride 
movement?  Perhaps homophobia and privo-phobia are linked 
somehow?  This lofts the scent of the far left centralist 
socialist or the far right fascist, terrified by discontinuity 
and even more mortified with the thought that it might be 
difficult to keep tabs on such individuals.
 
 
- ->
 
When are you going to stick it in your charter, anyway? How 
pseudospoofing == privacy == anonymity == pseudoanonymity == 
pseudonymity == holy liberation == bliss? What a delicious 
mystery. Life a SF book by Card. What a Card.
 
<-
 
Note the religious reference.
 
- ->
 
Also, I'm still waiting for some kind of comment from those 
*fabulous* leaders of yours. They're so coy with me. They've been 
flirting with me since I've been on the list. It's really sexy 
and erotic, actually, the way they strut around. You can look, 
but you can't touch! They're real masters at the dance. 
Ooooooh... just FABULOUTHS.
 
<-
 
I shouldn't need to point out the homosexual references again, 
but I think it important to note that they are all derogatory in 
nature.  The slur on FABULOUTHS just kills me.
 
- ->
 
Hey guys, you are so clever with the cyberspatial software 
tricks. Here's something I think you should come up with.
 
THE PSEUDOSPOOFING GAME
 
[About 600 words deleted]
 
 
These `pseudospoofed virgins' should be raped for great sport and 
satisfaction. You could get together afterwards and drink a few 
beers and brag about your scores and conquests, and how they 
wailed or cried at the end.
 
<-
 
Between homophobia, the introduction of non-consensual sex and 
Viking locker room talk, the conclusions about Mr. Detweiler's 
own feelings of inadequacy jump out without much need of 
assistance.
 
 
Regardless, Mr. Detweiler's posts are just not present in any 
constructive commentary it all.  He is quite good at stirring up 
emotions and irritating people beyond their ability to restrain 
themselves (note my post).  But when it comes to any original 
thought, I've seen little or nothing.  He's what I used to call 
"fluff" in law school.  Great at cutting people down with words, 
but couldn't win an oral argument with a live judge present if it 
meant his life.  Mr. Detweiler seems to think that cute one 
liners are fatal to reason.   Unfortunately, cute cut downs do 
not a well structured argument make.  Middle management material 
if I ever saw it.  Maybe a shift supervisor?
 
"C'mon Williams, your 'ole lady keep you up late last night?  Or 
was it your boyfriend, you queer?  Stevens, how nice of you to 
join us, you're ready for work this morning?  Wow! A break in the 
clouds! A breath of fresh air!  Now get to work you bums!"
 
Perfect illustration that a saboteur need not be clever at all, 
but only disruptive and persistent enough to be annoying and 
prevent anyone from unharassed constructive discourse.  In this 
regard I'm afraid he's won.  There is a agenda here, it seems to 
me that if Mr. Detweiler is not willing to follow it, and stay ON 
the path, perhaps he should be asked and then encouraged to 
leave.  I'm sure cries of censorship would abound, but at this 
point, I feel that these could hardly cause more trouble.
