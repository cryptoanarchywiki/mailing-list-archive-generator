Cypherpunks and Extropians:
  Two articles of interest in today's NYT: 1) [Front Page, lower right] A software  
vendor allegedly planted a virus in a customer's machine because he threatened to stop  
payment on the software he bought. The virus was programmed to shutdown the customer's  
computer. 

  2) [Front page, bottom, Business section] NeXT and Sun have announced a partnership.  
Apparently, Sun is to invest 10mil in NeXT for access to the source of their OOP  
environment. BTW, how much did Sun make last year? How much is 10mil by comparison?
