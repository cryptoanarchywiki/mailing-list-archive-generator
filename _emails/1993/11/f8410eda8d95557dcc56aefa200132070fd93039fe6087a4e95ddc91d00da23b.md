I'm a newcommer to DC-nets, so the following questions may sound funny to  
somebody that actually knows DC-nets...


1) What is happening on a DC-net when nobody is sending a message?  Is it  
simply issuing a stream of zeros?  Are "coins" being continuously flipped, even  
when no messages are being sent?

2) What does it look like (from a traffic flow perspective) when the DC-net  
transitions from no messages being sent to a message being sent?  The stream of  
zeros becomes and bunch of ones-and-zeros?

3) What happens when two members of a "table" attempt to transmit at the same  
time?  How is this case handled?

4) Are there any DC-net papers available for downloading via FTP?


Thanks,
