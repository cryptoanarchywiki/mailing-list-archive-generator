Recently I have received two keys that were unusable without modification (from wonderer and Sameer) because they were not prepared using canonical text. I had to replace all the carriage returns by hand (this is the workaround for mac users who receive PC keys). Why is non-canonical text even an option in pgp? Who would use it except by mistake?

As long as I'm at it, here are some more macPGP2.3 bugs, for those who care. Trying to decrypt a message signed by a key I don't have causes a serious crash requiring reboot. Trying to select cancel in a signature dialogue just raises the same dialogue box instead of cancelling. I'm running on a powerbook 145 under system 7.0.1.
