And this intuition of yours seems to be reflected in law and statute to a
greater degree than you're allowing elsewhere in your essay.  For example, U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said that the "right to be left alone is
the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men."[1]
Yet your opening lines are

It's hard to believe that support for privacy is _this_ lacking in law or
statute.

(Of course, the foregoing notwithstanding, I embrace the cypherpunks position
that securing privacy is one's own responsibility.)

Elsewhere you state

> Privacy was in a Hohfieldian manner, a privilege.

Hohfield sounds like an interesting read.  Can you give a reference?
