Many of you know of John Gilmore's Freedom of Information Act lawsuit
against NSA, which was written up in WIRED.

In September, Judge Henderson dismissed the case, ruling that there
was no claim for an injunction against NSA for its regular, routine
failure to respond to FOIA requests within the time limits provided
by the law.  

John has moved for reconsideration of the dismissal on a variety of
legal grounds.  The hearing on Monday 11/15 10 a.m. is in Courtroom
12, on the 19th floor of the U.S. Courthouse, 450 Golden Gate Ave.,
San Francisco.
