I got a call from David Arneke of AT&T yesterday. He was able to
answer a few questions for me: namely, that the reason no RSA-based
products are available is that they aren't finished yet!

AT&T Secure Systems put on a big push to have products ready to show
at COMDEX, and the DES/SHA/DSS-based products were ready first. Arneke
did say that they will be forthcoming.
