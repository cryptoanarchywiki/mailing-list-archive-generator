One can think up all sorts of hypothetical scenes.

Underneath it all however, I believe is a simple axiom.

When prevention methods thwart a criminals intent, they find new methods.

Car alarms and security systems didn't convince the criminals who make their
living ripping off cars that the *Good ole days were over* and it was time
to get a  job at Burger Sri, it spurred them to find new methods to ply
their trade.
Beyond that it didn't bother them to up the ante regarding the level of 
violence they would utilise.


Now extrapolate that into the concept of industrial espionage, 
white collar crime, and 
put everyone on the same wire.
