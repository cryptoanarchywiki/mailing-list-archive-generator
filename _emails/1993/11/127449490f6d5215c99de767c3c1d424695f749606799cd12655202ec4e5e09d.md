Is that true? How many slots are there? Is access to the slot unregulated?

The question is less one of creating new conduits than of seeing that the
conduits already in place (invariably under a government regulatory
regime, if not an outright monopoly) get used to their fullest potential.
Perry, you think that just letting things happen alone means that
someone's going to give you purchasable video uplink. I'm glad to hear it,
but I don't share you belief. Where we do agree, of course, is that access
to the cable part of the infrastructure (whether by building new conduits
or allocating sections of existing ones) shouldn't be subsidized by
government money, except of course to the extent that the government is
buying such services for itself.

I wouldn't say this is accurate. Even in multiple-cable areas, I
understand, the cable companies have government licenses and operate under
government regulation.

In the Boston area, there are multiple cable companies, but you can't
choose which one your particular home will use if you subscribe to cable.

Do those electric companies each have different wires? So that if 
I move into the house where you used to live, and you bought power from
company X, I can call up company Y and say "You're supplying power here
now"? How is this implemented.

I don't think discussion of "natural monopolies" is relevant here, because
it doesn't matter whether the monopolies that exist are natural or not.
They're here in any case.

I disagree that it's possible for all cable utilities to do this. If
you're the second cable system in a duopoly, maybe. But I don't know of a
debt market that will buy the bonds of the tenth cable company to lay
cable in a certain area. If you know of one, let's start it together--lots
of money to be made in cable!

I regularly read Cato Institute publications and white papers.

I overgeneralized. But the scenario I mention here is the most common
one.

They used the same wires, Perry.

This seems to be a digression. No one around here is arguing for
government monopolies. At least not so far as I can tell.
