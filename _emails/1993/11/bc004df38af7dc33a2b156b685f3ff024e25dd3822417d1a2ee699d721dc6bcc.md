In my last message I called him "Jason Plonk." This was not meant as
an insult ("*plonk*"), but reflected the fact that once I was in my
editor, I couldn't see his name and I misremembered it.

My friend Perry Metzger has long argued that sigs should not be
present at all in the body of a message, that the header conveys
adequate information.

Well, I disagree, and I always include my name and whatnot in the body
of my messages. Heads off confusion like we just saw.
