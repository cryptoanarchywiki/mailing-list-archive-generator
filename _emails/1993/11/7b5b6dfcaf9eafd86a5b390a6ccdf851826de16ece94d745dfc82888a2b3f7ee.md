DAMNIT! will you CYPHERPUNKS stop CONFLATING 

1) pseudonymity
2) anonymity
3) pseudoanonymity

you jerks CONTINUE to claim that (1) (2) and (3) are EQUIVALENT

Oh. I see. And you would regulate its use on the Internet. Gosh, that
sounds kind of like one of those fascist oppressive restrictions by an
outside authority. Something to bludgeon.

Call it a Keyserver, or a Digital Signature Server or a Toxic Waste
Dump, frankly, I don't care what you call it.

you `cypherpunks' have no idea what a true society constitutes. trust
is inherent to one. you guys all subscribe to the idea, `nothing is bad
if you can get away with it.' `if you can get away with it, you should try it.'

we'll see who has the last laugh.

HA, HA.
