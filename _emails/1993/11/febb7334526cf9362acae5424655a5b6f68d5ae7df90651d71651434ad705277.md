I gracefully concede about 90% of the points made against mine in 
this thread;
 
->
No, don't do that:

As the 10% remaining have nothing to do with crypto, I'm replying 
to them in personal mail.

It might be that this thread belongs in mail in general.  
Cypherpunks is a technical group after all no...?
