One application of pseudospoofing, a particularly insideous and
treacherous form, would be to create a `pool' of different accounts.
Everyone in the group can negotiate with each other `behind the scenes'
when to post from different accounts. This would be even more difficult
to detect than regular pseudospoofing (and, IMHO, even that much more
of a perversion) because all traces of consistency of identity are
subverted and lost.
