Don't type your PGP passphrase on a PC owned by someone else!  You
don't have to use your passphrase to exchange keys.  Keys can be
extracted, added, etc. without the passphrase being entered.

I don't see any way a virus could be spread via PGP key exchange.  At
best (worst) a virus could somehow attach itself to the PGP key file
but it would be just passive data.  It wouldn't do anything.
