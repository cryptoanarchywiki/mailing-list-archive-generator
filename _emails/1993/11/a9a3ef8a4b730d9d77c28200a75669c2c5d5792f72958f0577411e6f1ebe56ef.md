It's not that simple, unfortunately. Once monopolies have been created
with government support, removing government intervention doesn't 
automatically make competition happen.

Compare it to strip-mining: once a strip mine has dug up the landscape,
the mere decision to stop mining doesn't automatically restore the land to
the status quo ante, or even to an environment in which any kind of
ecosystem can flourish.
