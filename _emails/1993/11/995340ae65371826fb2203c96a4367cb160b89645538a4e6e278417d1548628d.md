Philippe makes another in a series of good points about our crypto
coffee shop: it is vulnerable to disruption by "screaming children."

Of course, not all usenet readers are screaming children; Tony Rippy,
in a cogent post, proves that he belongs in that happy group. However,
I present as counterexamples David Sternlight, John De Armond, and
John Palmer.

Those who have an interest in this subject will find the list, and we
should welcome them here. USENET gatewaying makes it waaay too easy
for the casual flamers and empty-headed arguers to drop in to visit
us.

Enjoy your coffee,
- -Paul
