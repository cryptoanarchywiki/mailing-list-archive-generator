  If the publication of this information is intended as a prelude to the 
RL persecution or harassment of Mr. Detweiler, I want to lodge a strong 
dissenting opinion. Mr. Detweiler's posts, made in an open forum, are his 
opinions on a number of matters relevant to the social implications of 
encryption and privacy. If we disagree with his views, we can post 
responses, or simply ignore them. Once anyone see's L. Detweiler on the 
header of any post, he or she has a pretty good idea of the tenor of 
what's coming. If you know it's going to enrage you, then why bother 
reading it?
  I personally think that, under the avalanche of rhetoric, he 
raises some very germane issues. I would miss him if he left. But even if 
I thought him 100% mistaken, I wouldn't endorse posting RL information 
about him so that people unhappy with his views could contact Mr. 
Detweiler's associates to complain about him.
