Absolutely true, though the question is whether or not this analysis
provides a *unique* style signature for a given individual.  Note how
quickly jargon is passed around and how quickly you, in conversation,
acquire new phrases from your surroundings.

This is where I begin to disagree.  Suppose one or two individuals wanted
to conduct a debate on a subject and steer the discussion to a
predetermined issue space.  By creating multiple identities (as Peter and
Val did in _Ender's Game_ by Orson Scott Card, *shameless plug:  GREAT
BOOK*), one could achieve this or another goal by varying the ideologies
expressed in the writing and foil this style of analysis.  Also, there is a
question about the reliability of context-sensitive text analysis engines. 
If the engine is knowledge base-driven, it is unreliable outside its realm
of expertise; if it's a neural net-based package, the training collection
is very important.
>
>* Noise -- variations in spelling, usage, etc.

The Net doesn't place a lot of emphasis on spelling and most posts/messages
aren't spell-checked, increasing the noise in the system.

>- many people use similar constructions and whatnot (like this)

Again, the "unique signature" problem.  Perhaps one could determine
regional background (New England, Deep South of the US etc.) from this
reliably, though I'm not sure how much farther the analysis could be
extended.

I would believe that these caveats are a significant barrier to establishng
a unique signature.

There is also the question of whether or not current text analysis programs
are capable of making these distinctions/correlations and whether or not
these distinctions can be communicated to the program overseers once they
are established.  

My basic position is that text analysis packages are probably not advanced
enough to reliably analyze more or less extemporaneous utterances
transmitted in the form of email or posts.  However, I second Tim's call
for a text analysis on various messages, beginning with those of single
authors to check the reliability of the system.  I'm just an amateur and of
no real help technically, but there's bound to be someone in one of the
CS/AI departments around the world that could provide us with a reasonable
text analysis engine.
