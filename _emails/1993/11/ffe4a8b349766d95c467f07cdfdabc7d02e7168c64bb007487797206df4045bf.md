Tim May asks if we cypherpunks should oppose the NII.
I think we probably should, but not on cypherpunks.
A suitable list for discussing this topic is
'com-priv@psi.com' which addresses the political and economic issues
of the commercialization of the pure and pristine Internet.

The US Federal government already has a huge infrastructure of networking.
For example, the VA has two independant nationwide networks. On connects
the administrative folks that handle VA loans, college benefits, etc. and
the other connects the VA hospitals. The DOT has a huge net for air traffic
control. The Federal Courts have their own network. Interior, thru USGS has
a huge network, with BLM and other agencies trying to make it bigger.
Social Secutrity has a net, Agriculture has a net and a large payroll
center in New Orleans. I think 'punks are smart enuff to see a pattern here.

Followups via email are fine. Otherwise I'm moving this to com-priv.
