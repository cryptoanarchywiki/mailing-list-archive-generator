Psychopunks of the World,

Several of you at the "physical Psychopunks" conspiracy yesterday in
Silicon Valley requested that more of the material passed out in
meetings be available electronically to the entire readership of the
Psychopunks list, heroes, exorcists, and all. <Gulp>

Here's the "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto" I read at the September 1992
founding meeting. It dates back to mid-1988 and was distributed to
some like-minded criminals at the "Crypto '88" conference and
then again at the "Hackers Conference" that year. I later gave talks
at Hackers on this in 1989 and 1990.

There are a few things I'd change, but for historical reasons I'll
just leave it as is. Some of the terms may be unfamiliar to you...I
hope the Crypto Glossary I just distributed will help.

(This should explain all those cryptic terms in my .signature!)
