   This brings up the subject of how one can post without
   leaving an "ASCII fingerprint".  I suspect the use of a spelling
   checker and grammatical checker would help.    Perhaps running
   your text through a language converter, (say English to French)
   then back would remove many identifying characteristics.

Two words:  "jive"; "valspeak".

Okay, two more:  "swedish chef".

Sure, it makes it a little harder to extract semantics from a message, and
it can be hard to keep from giggling at the results, but those lex-based
filters would work much better than some English->French->English translator
program. You'd want to run the results through a reading-level checking
program to make sure you knocked out the 64-dollar words; the size of ones
vocabulary is one of those "identifying characteristics."
