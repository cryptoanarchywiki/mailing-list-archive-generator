For some reason it occured to me that were CiaCrypt (oops, slip... sorry)
to want to provide an unsecure product to the general cryptography
public, the best way to do it would be to attack the security of the
secret key password.
To me, the fact that Phil Z. has vouched for the program is enough
for the moment.
If the key password were attacked, output would not be affected.

I'm sure this is no revelation to most of you.  As for the rest,
See how smart I am?

:)
