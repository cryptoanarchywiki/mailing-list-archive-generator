The opinions expressed are my own and do not represent the views of
Ameritech or any of its alliance partners.




 So, Markey proposes a bill that would "allow" the RBOC's to do
video.....


       Markey likes it....


                              The EFF likes it......


 I wouldn't invest a dime in a proposal that stupid.....


     not interested..........
