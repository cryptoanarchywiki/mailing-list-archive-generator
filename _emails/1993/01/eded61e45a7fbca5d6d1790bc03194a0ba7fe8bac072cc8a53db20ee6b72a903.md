Subject:  Biblio re>randomness and OTPs

Response was sufficient to merit posting this (brief
and specific) bibliography pertaining to a) randomness;
b) testing for randomness; and c) compression and
coding as it relates to privacy and maximizing entropy.

The items are listed in the order that *I* think
represents their helpfulness on this topic.

Two interesting quotes from Knuth (book [1] below):

  (sec3.2.2 para2 p25)
  One of the common fallacies encountered in
  connection with random number generation is the idea
  that we can take a good generator and modify it a
  little, in order get and "even-more-random" sequence.
  
  (sect3.3 para4 p38)
  ...The point of these remarks is that we cannot be
  trusted to judge by ourselves whether a sequence of
  numbers is random or not.  Some unbiased mechanical
  tests must be applied.
