RSAREF isn't legally exportable - that's correct. But RIPEM certainly
is. And there's nothing to prevent those overseas from using RIPEM
with whatever RSA and DES implementations they wish (they have at
least three good ones to choose from :-).

a) If "they" teach PGP to understand PEM - we could use RIPEM here
   to talk to them (they will use PGP, naturally).

b) If they get legal RIPEM and marry it with RSA/DES - we could talk
   with them using RIPEM on both ends.
