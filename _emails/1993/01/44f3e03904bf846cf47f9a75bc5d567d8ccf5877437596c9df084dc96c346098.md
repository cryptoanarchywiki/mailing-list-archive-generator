Since the only reason we are talking about RIPEM is because of legality 
concerns about PGP, I thought I'd mention that it is (at least theoretically) 
illegal to export RIPEM from the US, annd therefore could not be legally used 
to correspond with persons overseas.

I don't know if there is a legal way to do public key cryptography between 
persons inside the US and persons outside the US.
