    Chaum's idea was that the message contents would be encrypted at
    each step, as Eric suggests, but Chaum would have the encryption
    key be part of the anonymous address, created by the same person
    who made the anonymous address.  The idea would be, after
    decrypting the incoming message, the remailer would see something
    like:
 
        Anon-To: <next destination>
        Encrypt-With: <some DES or IDEA key>
 
    It would then encrypt the message "contents" (but not the
    "envelope", as Eric points out) using the specified key.  When the
    owner of the anonymous address received the message, he would
    decrypt it using the chain of "Encrypt-With" keys that he put into
    the anonymous address.
 
I'd like to point out that the "-ca" function of PGP could be used
to perform this function if Encrypt-With: specified a PGP pass-phrase
rather than a direct key.  I'd also like to suggest that the message-
body to be encrypted require heading and trailing delimiters such as:
 
-----BEGIN MESSAGE BODY-----
-----END MESSAGE BODY-----
 
Note delimiters would not be part of message body and would not
be encrypted.
