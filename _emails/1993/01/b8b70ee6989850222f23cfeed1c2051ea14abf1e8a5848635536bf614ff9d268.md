To the genius (Matthew Sean Pardo, mpaf1216@pelham.med.unc.edu), who
thought he was being clever by sending what he thought was "anonymous"
mail to me (by telnetting to port 25), you missed my point.
There's no need for the EXPN command to be used remotely.  I can only suggest
that John Gilmore disable it at toad, though it probably doesn't matter 
anymore.  If anonymity and privacy are as key as people are making them
out to be on this list, I find it ironic that privacy is lacking on such
a simple level.
