With strong crypto, e.g., with 300 decimal digit moduli, the "costs"
of decryption by brute force could easily exceed the GNP/GDP of the
U.S.

So taking the 5th, or claiming to have "forgotten" the key, should
work, all other things being equal. But all other things are not
equal...perhaps they eavesdropped as the private key was being typed
in (and it was stored somewhere, presumably), perhaps they "black
bagged" the house, perhaps a simple pass phrase was used in lieu of
memorizing 300 digits, and so on.

A lot of work lies ahead.
