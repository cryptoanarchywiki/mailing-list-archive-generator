Mr. Thug,

In talking about "white" noise, you mentioned:

Why not feed back the previously encrypted bits to perform the
"present" encryption (something like cipher block chaining) to keep
this from happening?  Then any particular encrypted character will
depend on *all* previous characters and break up runs of "plaintext".
That seems much better than un-whitening your white noise...
