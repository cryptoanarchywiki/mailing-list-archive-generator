Personaly (mostly before pgp) I used to set up direct uucp connections
to people I *had* have secure email with (I once had some sensitive email
intercepted thus causing *much* trouble for me).  

Since alot of my friends have unix boxes (Sun/SCO/386bsd/etc...) uucp
is alot easer.

PS: If anyone wants a uucp connection send me email

PPS: once I get my sendmail.cf cleaned up I can add people to my domain
	and I will set up a remailer.
