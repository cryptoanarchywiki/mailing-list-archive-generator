Anyway, RSADSI released RSAREF toolkit free for non-commercial use.
RIPEM (with RSAREF bundled in :-) allows you to create as many key
pairs as your soul wishes.   And surprise,  you are allowed to use
them...

So let's face real problems, rather than RSA patent (which hopefully
will expire by itself :-).
