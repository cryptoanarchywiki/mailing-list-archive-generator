Probably the first two even a paranoid person won't call "weaknesses".
The pass-phrase - th docs should give some guidelines, as to how one
must choose his pass-phrase (if it's already there - apologies :-).

It looks  like that [former] Soviet professor found and pointed out
exactly those weaknesses: poor RSA keys (making factoring about two
orders of magnitude easier) and poor something else (I couldn't
understand what he meant, sorry :-). Quite possible he hit
session keys (as likely as not)...
