Well, their license says, that "they will grant permission for any
reasonable request" for modification to RSAREF, or to access to
those unpublished routines.

I guess until somebody asks about such a permission and gets
rejected, or granted - we'll never know...  [BTW, I aske and
got such permission for my own private needs...]  Now, who's
willing to volunteer? (:-)
