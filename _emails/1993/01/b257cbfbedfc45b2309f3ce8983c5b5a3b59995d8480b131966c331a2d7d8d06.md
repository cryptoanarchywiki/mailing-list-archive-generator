Yes, we've discussed this a couple of times.

For a 2 pi detector geometry, about 100,000 decays per second are
needed to give the 40,000 or so that the detector could see. This is
about 3 microcuries (1 curie = 3.7 x 10^10 disintegrations per
second), which is far higher than the Am-241 smoke detector sources
have (0.1 microcurie, if I remember correctly...but I could be wrong
on this, as it's been years...).

(There's also the issue of detector drift, with such high levels
causing changes in the detector properties.)

Obviously, multiple detectors could be used, each generating perhaps
several thousand bits pers second. It'll still take a week or so to
fill a single CD-ROM.

Not too practical. Nor is the production and distribution of CD-ROMS
very convenient. Using this for "Cypherpunks"-type activities would be
a nightmare of inconvenience for all concerned.
