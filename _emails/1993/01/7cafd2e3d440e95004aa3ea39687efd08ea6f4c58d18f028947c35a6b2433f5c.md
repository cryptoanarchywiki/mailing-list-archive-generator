this is dead on true. the whole problem of all this is our "transition
period" until encryption is matter-of-course. and the possibility that
serious opposition will actually arise to delay that day even further.

once everyone does it, most of (but not all of) the special contingencies
are unnecessary.

what I am trying to address is how things are now, and how they may change
one way, or another. and to find the best multi-solution for most of these
possibilities....until that happy day you speak of.
