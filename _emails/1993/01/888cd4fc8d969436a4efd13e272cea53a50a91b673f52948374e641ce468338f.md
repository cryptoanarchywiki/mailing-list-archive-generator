Here's an interesting solution...  You can program a message filter to add
extract letters to each PGP character to make it a word.
I'm sure you could find any database of words and have it randomly make first
letters... it'd be pretty simple... and then the receiver would just take every
letter followed by a space...  and if you wanted to be ultra-sneaky (who, us)
you could have null words that change conditions in the letter... like
switching to the second letter in the word, or skipping the next word
altogether... but what to do with no-letter PGP codes... ok, the first TWO
letters of the word indicate a character... sort of like a byte...
hey, I think I might just write this sucker...

Code will follow!
