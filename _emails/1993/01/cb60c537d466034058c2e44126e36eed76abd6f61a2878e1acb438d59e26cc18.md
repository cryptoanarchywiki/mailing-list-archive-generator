As is the case with a good many other gov't. agencies, one can be sure
that all the crew are not 9-to-5ers showing up at one office.

>The 40,000 figure may or may not be accurate, as the NSA won't say.

It has been a good many years since I traveled in the lower strata of
these circles, but it was my information that the NSA, at least at that
time, had a manpower pool "hugely greater than the CIA's."  It is my
understanding that the NSA budget is highly classified - unavailable
even to most members of Congress.

>Bear in mind that they are the nation's
>primary SIGINT facility...

I believe you'll find that the NSA also is involved in SATINT & ELINT
as well.  Never Say Anythings are busy little bees.

>operating the various listening posts in
>conjunction with military personnel (via Army Security Agency, Naval
>Security Group, Air Forc, etc.).

It is my belief from personal experience that the NSA requests &
receives operational assistance from those innocuous agencies in
positions to gather information of use to the NSA in the course of their
routine duties.

>As always, read James Bamford's "The Puzzle Palace," which gets
>referred to a lot on this list.

I've tried to read this famous tome a couple of times, but have been
unable to hack its turgid prose.  Someday. perhaps...

Excuse me, Tim?
