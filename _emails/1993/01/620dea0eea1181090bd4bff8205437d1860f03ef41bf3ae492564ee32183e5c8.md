Yes, but so what? That is, why does it matter so long as all the
conversion from one to the next takes place automatically. The process
strengthens your security as well as that of any respondent. True this
may not be necessary, but under the circumstances (the whole point of
alias servers) isn't a "lets not take chances" approach best?

Lets take an extreme case (not that I'm suggesting things be implemented
this way). Imagine that every time you or anyone else originates mail
through an Aserver you are given a NEW ID (not just the first time, but
EVERY TIME). Again, so long as a relationship is maintained between all
your ID's on a given server and their corresponding ID's on the next
machine down or up the line, it shouldn't matter to you at all! After a
few years you could end up with hundreds or thousands of IDs. What
difference would it make? You don't need to know what *any* of them
are...
