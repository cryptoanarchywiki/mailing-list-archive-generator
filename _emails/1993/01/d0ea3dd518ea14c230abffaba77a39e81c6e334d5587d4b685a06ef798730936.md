yeah, and I'm cc'ing cypherpunks, since I think you all might be
interested, too.

This script has three functions.  All take the output of pgp -kvv as
input.

1) it "inverts" a pgp file, listing all the keys signed by a given
key, as compared to giving all the keys which have signed a given key.

2) given -kvv output (and it can merge several files of input
automatically, since it hashes on key id), it lists all the keys which
you (or any other key) have a path of signatures to, and the length of
the shortest such path.  So, the specified key has a path length 0.
All keys signed by that key have a path length 1, all keys signed by
those keys have path length 2, etc.

3) Optionally, it will list one of these paths for each key you can
reach.  There may be many paths, so this is only for interest; to
enumerate all paths would be painful.

The most interesting use for this script is to see what your "radius"
is (maximum distance to any key), and to see how big your "world" is.
Needless to say, I wouldn't trust keys which have a long path length
too much, if at all.  There are 155 keys in my "world" (out of a
keyring of about 350).  My current radius is 7.  Tom, if you're in
Boston anytime, my radius would decrease to 5 if I signed your key.
That would be cool :-)
