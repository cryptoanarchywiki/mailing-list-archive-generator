Prehaps that would be of value, but its best not to think of it as
worth too much. After all, the bad guys can likely just subscribe to
the list, and they could always just eavesdrop on the outgoing mail.
Fixing this "hole" is o.k. so long as no one believes that it has
actually added to security in any substantial way. Its best that no
false sense of security be engendered. Everyone should know and
understand that the structures as they exist are almost completely
insecure.
