Had sort of a slow day at work, so I had the chance to crank out this:

Here is a rough script which will allow you to route your mail through
the various remailers.  (However, extropia is not yet supported...I'm
working on it).  You must have the public key for each remailer on
your keyring.

Save the file, run it, and it will prompt for 1) mail, or 2) header.
Choose 1 to pick a path and send a file, choose 2 to create a header
which can be used to reach you.  I intend option 2 to be used as
follows: create a message to someone you want to remain anonymous
from, run the script, pick 2, follow the prompts, and then instruct
the script to append the header to your letter.  Then your recipient
will be able to follow the directions and respond to you.

When the script prompts for "And then to (1-3 or address)", to end the
process, type the final address you want your mail sent to.  Of
course, if you are creating a header, you'll want to type your own
address.

Further improvements include supporting extropia; and rewriting in C,
perl, awk, ksh, or any language with arrays!

I've tested this script using the remailers at alumni and rosebud,
because the turnaround time seems faster.  But there is no reason
that rebma shouldn't work as well.
