As a liscenced ham (amature radio operator), kb6wct, I can assure you
that the FCC allows transmissions other than phone, and morse code.
Here are just a few -- rtty, ascii, spread spectrum, fax, sstv, and
ntsc video.  Hams can SEND all of these over the radio.  There are
still other information transmission systems in use by comercial
interests.

However, the FCC does in fact dissallow hams from transmitting in "any
code or cypher with intent to obscure the content of the message."
This allows all cryptographic authentication systems, but not
encryption.
