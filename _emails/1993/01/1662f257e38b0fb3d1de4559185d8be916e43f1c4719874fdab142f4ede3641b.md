Thank you.  Welcome to the world of common sense.
It's a given that certain things you just can't be secure against.
But when you don't take every precaution, no matter how small, it's
called laziness.
Not fixing it with the excuse that people have to understand or accept the
overall insecurity of things in general sounds pretty idiotic to me.
It isn't such a big deal.
