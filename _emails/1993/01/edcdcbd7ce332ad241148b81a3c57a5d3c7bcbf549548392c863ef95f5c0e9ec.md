this is a one in 2^500 event.  just to remind you, 2^500 is 

3,273,390,607,896,141,870,013,189,696,827,599,152,216,642,046,043,064,789,483,291,368,096,133,796,404,674,554,883,270,092,325,904,157,150,886,684,127,560,071,009,217,256,545,885,393,053,328,527,589,376

(sorry to those folks whose screens get bugged by looooong lines.)

i wouldn't worry about a 1 in 2^500 event occurring too often ...
