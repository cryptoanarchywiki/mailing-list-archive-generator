Since none of us have ever been inside the NSA, we cannot  
underestimate
their power and resources.  For all we know they may have 500 Intel  
Delta
supercomputers linked together, each having 65,536 i860-XP/50mhz  
chips.
We really don't know what kind of iron they possess.  Thus we can't  
assume
that they can't factor extremely large numbers easily.

The only way to thwart the NSA is to use an encryption scheme which  
has
been _proven_ uncrackable.  The only one I know of is the One Time  
Pad.

True, but impractical.  I can't conceive of any rational one-time-pad  
key distribution over the net.  Key distribution has to be over a  
guaranteed secure channel.  For RSA, the channel only has to be  
authenticated.  And if NSA can crack RSA, it would be worth having  
one cypherpunk lose one court case to find that out (yup, even if  
it's me...).
