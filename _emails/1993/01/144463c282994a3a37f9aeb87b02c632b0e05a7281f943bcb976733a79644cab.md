It is a solved problem. It doesn't even require SLIP. I spent lots
of hours over the past year trying to get SLIP to work with
the GMU computers. it is officially "not supported"

With NUpop and Eudora, SLIP is optional. The NUpop docs say
that SLIP slows down the transfer, and recommends simple ASCII
async connection using a reliable modem (MNP or V42/V.42bis)

Using a computer as a computer is clearly the way to go. There
are a number of low-cost or free Unix providers, I expect that
they do, or can be talked into supporting POP.

I expect that current terminal/menu based BBSes will disapear
once folks realize how much better easier, faster, and all
around better programs that use computers as computers work.
