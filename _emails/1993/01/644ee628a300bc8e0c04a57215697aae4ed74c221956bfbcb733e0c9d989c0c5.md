I should like to see the body of case law on which this opinion is
based, if any.
.   Recently this question came up in another forum on encryption & an
"authority" on communications law claimed the probable scenario would be
that the arresting agency would have the encrypted material decrypted by
a competent government or academic agency & the costs of said decryption
would eventually be recovered from the defendant through civil suits,
presuming the defendant had sufficient assets.  It is my memory of the
thread that he claimed this had been done in previous cases.
