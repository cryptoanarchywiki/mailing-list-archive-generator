# PS: ther party went very well and I did get a chance to meet a few more
# people from this list.

I also made it to the party, and would not have, had it not been for
the announcement on cypherpunks.  Please do make announcements ...  and
leave it for individual punks to decide how far they should drive, fly,
swim, etc. for a party!  ( It took me two trains, one bus, and a seven
block walk. )
