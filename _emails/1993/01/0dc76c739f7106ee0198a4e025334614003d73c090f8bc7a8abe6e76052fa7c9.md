> 
> SCOPE:
> 
> The advance of computer and telecommunications technologies holds great 
> promise for individuals and society. From convenience for consumers and 
> efficiency in commerce to improved public health and safety and 
> increased participation in democratic institutions, these technologies 
> can fundamentally transform our lives.
> 
> At the same time these technologies pose threats to the ideals of a free 
> and open society. Personal privacy is increasingly at risk from invasion 
> by high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping. The myriad databases 
> containing personal information maintained in the public and private 
> sectors expose private life to constant scrutiny.
> 
> Technological advances also enable new forms of illegal activity, posing 
> new problems for legal and law enforcement officials and challenging the 
> very definitions of crime and civil liberties. But technologies used to 
> combat these crimes can pose new threats to freedom and privacy.
> 
> Even such fundamental notions as speech, assembly and property are being 
> transformed by these technologies, throwing into question the basic 
> Constitutional protections that have guarded them. Similarly, 
> information knows no borders; as the scope of economies becomes global 
> and as networked communities transcend international boundaries, ways 
> must be found to reconcile competing political, social and economic 
> interests in the digital domain.
> 
> The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will assemble 
> experts, advocates and interested people from a broad spectrum of 
> disciplines and backgrounds in a balanced public forum to address the 
> impact of computer and telecommunications technologies on freedom and 
> privacy in society. Participants will include people from the fields of 
> computer science, law, business, research, information, library science, 
> health, public policy, government, law enforcement, public advocacy and 
> many others.

> Pre-Conference Tutorials:
> On Tuesday 9 March, the day before the formal conference begins, CFP'93
> is offering a number of in-depth tutorials on a wide variety of subjects
> on four parallel tracks. These presentations will range from interesting
> and informative to thought-provoking and controversial. The tutorials
> are available at a nominal additional registration cost.
> 
> Conference Reception:
> Following the Tutorials on Tuesday evening, you are invited to meet new 
> and old friends and colleagues at an opening reception. 
> 
> Single Track Main Program:
> The technological revolution that is driving change in our society has
> many facets and we are often unaware of the way they all fit together,
> especially the parts that lie outside of our own expertise and interest.
> The primary goal of CFP'93 is to bring together individuals from
> disparate disciplines and backgrounds, and engage them in a balanced
> discussion of all CFP issues. To this end our main program, starting on
> Wednesday 10 March, is on a single track enabling our attendees to take
> part in all sessions.
> 
> Registration is Limited:
> CFP'93 registration will be limited to 550 attendees, so we advise you 
> to register as early as possible and take advantage of the early 
> registration discounts.
> 
> Luncheons and Banquets:
> A key component of the CFP conferences has been the interaction between
> the diverse communities that constitute our attendees. To promote this
> interaction CFP'93 is providing three luncheons and evening two banquets
> with the cost of conference registration.
> 
> EFF Pioneer Awards
> All conference attendees are invited to the Awards Reception sponsored 
> by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) on Wednesday evening, 10 
> March. These, the second annual EFF Pioneer Awards, will be given to 
> individuals and organizations that have made distinguished contributions 
> to the human and technological realms touched by computer-based 
> communications.
> 
> Birds of a Feather Sessions:
> CFP'93 will provide a limited number of meeting rooms to interested 
> individuals for special Birds of a Feather sessions after the formal 
> program each evening. These sessions will provide an opportunity for 
> special interest discussions that were not included in the formal 
> program and will be listed in the conference materials. For further

> 
> CFP'93 Tutorials:
> 
> Tuesday 9 March - Morning Tutorials
> 
> Information Use in the Private Sector
> Jack Reed, Information Resource Service Company
> Diane Terry, TransUnion Corp.    Dan Jones, D.Y. Jones & Assoc.
> 
> This tutorial will deal with the use of personal information from the
> point of view of some private sector information vendors and users. It
> will include a discussion of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the
> "Permissible Purposes" for obtaining a consumer credit report.
> Information used for purposes outside the FCRA will be discussed in
> relationship to privacy and societal needs for businesses and
> individuals.
> 
> Access to Government Information:
> James Love, Director, Taxpayer Assets Project
> 
> The tutorial will examine a wide range of problems concerning citizen 
> access to government information, including how to ask for and receive 
> information under the federal Freedom of Information Act, what types of 
> information government agencies store on computers, what the barriers 
> are to citizen access to these information resources, and how citizens 
> can change government information policy to expand access to taxpayer-
> funded information resources.
> 
> Exploring the Internet -- a guided journey
> Mark Graham, Pandora Systems	Tim Pozar, Late Night Software
> 
> This tutorial will give participants a practical introduction to the 
> most popular and powerful applications available via the world's largest 
> computer network, the Internet.  There will be hands-on demonstrations 
> of communications tools such as e-mail, conferencing, Internet Relay 
> Chat, and resource discovery and navigation aids such as Gopher, WAIS, 
> Archie and World Wide Web. Extensive documentation will be provided.
> 
> Constitutional Law for Non-lawyers (1/2 session):
> Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation
> 
> This tutorial is designed to inform non-lawyers about the Constitutional 
> issues that underlie computer-crime and computer civil-liberties cases.  
> The tutorial focuses on the First and Fourth Amendments, but includes a 
> discussion of the Fifth Amendment and its possible connection to the 
> compelled disclosure of cryptographic keys. It also includes a 
> discussion of the appropriateness of "original intent" as a method for 
> applying the Constitution in the modern era.
> 
> Civil Liberties Implications of Computer Searches & Seizures (1/2 ses.):
> Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation
> 
> This tutorial assumes only a very basic knowledge of Constitutional law 
> (the prior tutorial provides an adequate background), and outlines how 
> searches and seizures of computers may raise issues of First and Fourth 
> Amendment rights, as well as of federal statutory protections. It 
> includes a discussion of what proper search-and-seizure techniques in 
> such cases may be. 
> 

> 
> Tuesday 9 March - Afternoon Tutorials
> 
> Practical Data Inferencing: What we THINK we know about you.
> Russell L. Brand, Senior Computer Scientist, Reasoning Systems
> 
> What do your transaction trails reveal about you?  Are you a good risk 
> to insure?  Are you worth kidnapping, auditing or suing?  Which products 
> should I target at you?  Are you a member of one of those groups that I 
> would want to harass or discriminate against? This tutorial will be a 
> hands-on approach to digging for data and to piecing it back together.  
> Time will be divided between malicious personal invasions and sweeping 
> searches that seek only profit, followed by a brief discussion about 
> improper inferences and their practical impact on innocent files and 
> lives. Legal and moral issues will not be addressed.
> 
> Telecommunications Fraud
> Donald P. Delaney, Senior Investigator, New York State Police
> 
> Illegal call sell operations in New York City are estimated to be a 
> billion dollar industry. This tutorial will provide an overview of the 
> problem, from finger hacking to pay phone enterprises, and will include 
> an up-to-date assessment of the computer cracker/hacker/phone phreak 
> impact on telephone company customer losses. Also discussed will be 
> unlawful access of telephone company switches; unlawful wiretapping and 
> monitoring; cards, codes and 950 numbers; New York State law and police 
> enforcement; methods of investigation and case studies.
> 
> Private Sector Marketplace and Workplace Privacy 
> Ernest A. Kallman, Bentley College, H. Jeff Smith, Georgetown University
> 
> This tutorial will give participants a general overview of privacy 
> issues affecting uses of personal information (e.g., medical 
> information, financial information, purchase histories) in the 
> marketplace as well as privacy concerns in the workplace (e.g., privacy 
> of electronic and voice mail, work monitoring).  The tutorial will also 
> set the boundaries for privacy arguments in the middle and latter 1990s.
> 
> SysLaw
> Lance Rose, Attorney and Author "SysLaw"
> 
> The SysLaw tutorial session will explore in depth the freedom and
> privacy issues encountered by computer bulletin boards (BBS), their
> system operators and their users.  BBSs are estimated to number over
> 45,000 today (not counting corporate systems), and range from small,
> spare-time hobby systems to systems with thousands of users, grossing
> millions of dollars.  BBSs are a grassroots movement with an entry cost
> of $1,000 or less, and the primary vehicles for new forms of electronic
> communities and services. Subjects covered will include: First Amendment
> protection for the BBS as publisher/distributor; data freedom and
> property rights on the BBS; how far can sysops control BBS user
> activities?; and user privacy on BBSs today.
> 
> Note: Tutorial presenters will offer expert opinions and information.
> Some may advocate particular viewpoints and thus may put their own
> "spin" on the issues. Caveat Listener. 
> 

> 
> CFP'93 Main Program Sessions: 
> 
> Wednesday 10 March
> 
> Electronic Democracy
> Chair - Jim Warren, MicroTimes and Autodesk, Inc.
> 
> The effects of computer and telecommunications technologies on 
> democratic processes and institutions are increasing dramatically. This 
> session will explore their impacts on political organizing, campaigning, 
> access to representatives and agencies, and access to government 
> information that is essential for a free press and an informed 
> electorate.
> 
> Electronic Voting -- Threats to Democracy
> Chair - Rebecca Mercuri, University of Pennsylvania
> 
> This panel session will invite representatives covering a broad spectrum 
> of involvement with the controversial subject of electronic vote 
> tallying to address such issues as: Is a secure and reliable electronic 
> voting system feasible? What threats to these systems are identifiable? 
> Should electronic voting systems be open for thorough examination? Can 
> auditability be assured in an anonymous ballot setting? Can voting by 
> phone be practical and confidential? Did Congress exempt voting machines 
> from the Computer Security Act?
> 
> Censorship and Free Speech on the Networks
> Chair - Barbara Simons, IBM
> 
> As online forums become increasingly pervasive, the notion of "community 
> standards" becomes harder to pin down. Networks and BBSs will link--or 
> create--diverse, non-geographic communities with differing standards, 
> laws, customs and mores. What may be frank discussion in one forum may 
> be obscenity or defamation or sexual harassment in another. This session 
> will explore the questions of what kinds of freedom-of-speech problems 
> face us on the Net and what kinds of legal and social solutions we need.
> 
> Portrait of the Artist on the Net
> Chair - Anna Couey, Arts Wire
> 
> Computer forums and networks make possible both new artforms and new 
> ways of remote collaboration and exhibition. The growth of the Net 
> creates opportunities for the blossoming of dynamic and interactive 
> artforms and of artistic cultures -- provided that networks become 
> widely accessible and remain open to artistic expression without 
> political interference. This session will examine the potentials and the 
> problems of art and artists on the Net.
> 
> 

> 
> Thursday 11 March
> 
> Digital Telephony and Crypto Policy
> Chair - John Podesta, Podesta and Associates
> 
> The increasingly digital nature of telecommunications potentially 
> threatens the ability of law enforcement agencies to intercept them when 
> legally authorized to do so. In addition, the potential widespread use 
> of cryptography may render the ability to intercept a communication 
> moot. This session will examine these issues and the proposals that 
> have been put before Congress by law enforcement agencies to address 
> these perceived problems.
> 
> Health Records and Confidentiality
> Chair - Janlori Goldman, American Civil Liberties Union
> 
> As the new Administration and Congress consider proposals to reform the 
> United States health care system, it is imperative that confidentiality 
> and security safeguards be put in place to protect personal information. 
> Currently, no comprehensive legislation exists on the confidentiality of 
> health information. This session will explore the current and potential 
> uses of health care information, and proposals to safeguard the 
> information.
> 
> The Many Faces of Privacy
> Chair  - Willis Ware, Rand Corp.
> 
> Privacy at any cost is foolish, unwise and an untenable position, and 
> privacy at zero cost is a myth. This two-part session will explore the 
> balancing act between the two extremes and the costs and benefits that 
> accrue. The first part will present several examples of systems and 
> applications in the public and private sectors that stake out a position 
> in this continuum.   The second part will be a panel discussion 
> exploring the issues raised by the examples previously presented.
> 
> The Digital Individual
> Chair - Max Nelson-Kilger, San Jose State University
> 
> We are all represented by personal records in countless databases. As 
> these records are accumulated, disseminated and coalesced, each of us is 
> shadowed by an ever larger and more detailed data alter-ego, which 
> increasingly stands in for us in many situations without our permission 
> or even awareness. How does this happen? How does it affect us? How will 
> it develop in the future? What can we do? This session will investigate 
> these questions.
> 

> 
> Friday 12 March
> 
> Gender Issues in Computing and Telecommunications
> Chair - Judi Clark, Bay Area Women in Telecommunications
> 
> Online environments are largely determined by the viewpoints of their
> users and programmers, still predominantly white men. This panel will
> discuss issues of freedom and privacy that tend to affect women -- such
> as access, identity, harassment, pornography and online behavior -- and
> provide recommendations for gender equity policies to bulletin board
> operators and system administrators.
> 
> The Hand That Wields the Gavel
> Chair - Don Ingraham, Asst. District Attorney, Alameda County, CA
> 
> An inevitable result of the settlement of Cyberspace is the adaptation
> of the law to its particular effects. In this session  a panel of
> criminal lawyers addresses the fallout from a hypothetical computer
> virus on the legal responsibilities of system managers and operators.
> The format will be a simulated court hearing. Attendees will act as
> advisory jurors in questioning and in rendering a verdict.
> 
> The Power, Politics, and Promise of Internetworking
> Chair- Jerry Berman, Electronic Frontier Foundation
> 
> This session will explore the development of internetworking 
> infrastructures, domestically and worldwide. How will this 
> infrastructure and its applications be used by the general public?  What 
> will the global network look like to the average user from Kansas to 
> Kiev?  How will politics, technology and legislation influence the 
> access to, and cost of, the Net?  How can the potential of this powerful 
> medium be fully realized?
> 
> International Data Flow
> Chair - George Trubow, John Marshall Law School
> 
> The trans-border flow of information on international computer networks 
> has been a concern for governments and the private sector. In addition 
> to concerns for privacy and data security, the economic and national 
> security implications of this free flow of information among scientists, 
> engineers and researchers around the world are also cause for concern. 
> This session will assemble a number of speakers to compare the various 
> perspectives on the problem
