Hiya....
        I found this post in a newsgroup that I try to follow.  Don't know
about etiquette about how this should have been edited, so it's all here,
headers and all.  Anyway, I would like to know if the info is accurate, bull or
what?
        FYI, the ISA means Internal Security Act (back in Malaysia) and they
have had UUCP for a few years (but UUCP's hardly enough for the kinds of
traffic they are talking about, but then a few private companies *did* have
full Internet, so..... it's possible that the "thingy" was there without public
knowledge....

        When in doubt, assume they will (or for that matter, have been).
In fact, Malaysia has *ALWAYS* been capable of monitoring Usenet news since a
long time ago, since Malaysia has long been connected via UUCP, which is
capable of providing a news feed.
