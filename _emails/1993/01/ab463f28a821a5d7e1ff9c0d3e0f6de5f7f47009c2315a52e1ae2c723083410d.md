There has been some discussion on the Pax mailing list (mail to
anon.subscribe@pax.tpa.com.au to subscribe) about anonymous posting

Does anyone here have information on this experiment on the WELL?
That sounds like an interesting data point.  Presumably they did not
try to press on with some kind of rating or reputation system.
