This is neat.  It sounds like the plan is to provide a convenient
mail filtering tool which provides remailer capability as a SIDE EFFECT!
What a great way to spread remailers!

Not to mention, the same tools can provide automatic encryption and
decryption - the long-sought integration of PGP (or RIPEM, etc.) with
mail in an easy-to-use way.

I'm really looking forward to seeing more about this idea.

Speaking of integrating encryption into email, does anybody here
have access to the announced beta-test of PEM from TIS?  It would be
interesting to see the documentation about how they've handled the
user-interface issue.  I gather that it only works with the MH package
but presumably they've had to face some of the problems we're talking
about here.
