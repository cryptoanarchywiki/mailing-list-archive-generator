Cool. I'm not a member of the mailing list.
You can tell them if they want a copy of the 
code they should send me a note. They can get it in 
either C or Pascal. The C comes with tar wrapping
paper for the faux industrial tech look.
(I can't wait until Crate and Barrel start 
mining the Civil Defencse era for new retro-trendy

At the risk of sounding like Peter G Neumann, I should comment that
the combination of mimic functions and Mime mail could lead
to lots of silliness and hand-waving ....
