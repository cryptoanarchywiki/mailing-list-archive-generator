Has anyone thought about the consequence of randomly picking a
remailing path instead of using the same one?  It occurred to me
yesterday that randomly picked paths could reveal more information to
the remailer sites so that they could figure out the connection
between a pseudonym and the eventual destination pretty well.  It's
just an intuition at this point, though.
