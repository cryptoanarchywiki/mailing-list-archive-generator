What is illegal to export is the software implementations of strong  
cryptography, not messages encrypted with them, or even detailed  
specifications of how to implement compatible software.  So,  
theoretically, if a group in each COCOM-complying country and a group  
out of the reach of COCOM each independently implemented software to  
do the public-key cryptography (the U.S. group is the only one that  
will have to worry about licensing PKP's patents), then trading  
encrypted mail would be unquestionably legal.

It would also be a lot of wasted work and duplicated effort, and I  
don't see any reason to respect the laws that make exporting or  
importing this software illegal.  RIPEM has no doubt escaped the U.S.  
since RSADSI put it up for anonymous FTP last week, and PGP is  
everywhere.
