While what you say is certainly true, it won't survive any kind 
of detailed attack. I'm all for the sentiment, but while there 
are so many mundane things going on round about, the best way to 
remain undetected is to remain undecipherable and to make sure 
that there is enough traffic about of the same sort. Press for 
encipherment of e-mail, that way, if everybody is doing it, who's 
to know what the underworld is doing? This is especially useful 
if you are not actually interested in violent revolution. You can 
then convince the powers that be that you are not worth 
monitoring.
