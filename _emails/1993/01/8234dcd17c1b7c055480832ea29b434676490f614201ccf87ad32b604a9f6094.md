Yes, I have heard of using diodes for white noise production.  Hoewver, I am
conserned as to the nature of this noise.  Is it some property of the silicon
or is it just amplified radio noise that is bringing the diode above
threshold??

Vercotti: I was terrified of him.  Everyone was terrified of Doug.  I've seen
          grown men pull their own heads off rather than see Doug.  Even
          Dinsdale was frightened of Doug.
Interviewer: What did he do?
Vercotti: He used sarcasm.  He knew all the tricks, dramatic irony,
          metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and satire.
