Cypherpunks, I'd like to get Mosaic - I read about it in the NYT. I got several  
responses to my inquiry: Where can you get Mosaic? (Thanks). However, when I  
tried ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu and zaphod at same, there was no /Mosaic directory  -  
looked in index, etc., couldn't find it, basically. Any other sites or did I  
miss something? 


(I'm on NeXT (4.3BSD) so I was looking for the unix version.)
