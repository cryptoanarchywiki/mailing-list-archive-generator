The DES implementation I'm most familiar with (the DES library core
written by Dennis Ferguson) uses moderately large (by your standards)
read-only tables.  The IP and FP tables are each 256*4 bytes (2Kbytes
total); the expanded S boxes are 8*64*4 bytes (another 2K bytes), and
the key schedule code uses a 48*4 byte table and two 4*64*4 byte
tables (another 2K+).  It's optimized for 32 (and larger) bit
processors, but it probably wouldn't be all bad on a 16 bit system.

The expanded key schedule uses 8 bytes per round times 16 rounds, or
128 bytes per currently active key (1/8 of your available memory).

However, only 48 bits of key schedule are actually needed per round (8
subfields of 6 bits each), so you could (at the cost of some speed,
probably a penalty of 50% to 100% or so) compress the schedule down to
96 bytes if it really mattered to you..

You could also compute each round of the key schedule as you needed it
(discarding it on the fly) reducing the memory needed per key to 8
bytes of "persistant" storage and a little bit more dynamic memory
when actually doing the encryption.. of course, performance goes down
the tubes if you do this unless you only use each key once..
