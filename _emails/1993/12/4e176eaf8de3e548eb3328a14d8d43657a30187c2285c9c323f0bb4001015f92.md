   Out of curiousity, has any ftp-archive maintainer tried to join the
   American Library Association, either directly or as part of some
   university's library system?

I'm not sure what this would do. My wife is a professional librarian and a
member of the ALA (and SLA and a few other besides) - as far as I know, the
ALA doesn't directly intervene to protect its members.
