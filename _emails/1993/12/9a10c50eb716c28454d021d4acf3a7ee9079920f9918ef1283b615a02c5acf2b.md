Where's a good ftp site for papers on blind signature methods
(RSA-compatible) and Chaum-type digicash? Is there an online
digicash with strong anonymity? Where to ftp info on it?

Are the patentholders of LUC and other public-key systems any more
reasonable about noncommercial use than RSA? Interesting to note
that RSA let the writers of HPACK modify RSAREF to use MDC
encryption, even though HPACK uses PGP keys as well as RIPEM.
Seems Bidzos is just vindictive, not to mention scared to death,
by PGP. After all, his lousy company exists because of one patent
which is on shaky legal ground, other algorithm patents having
been shot down. So far, they've managed to keep their licensing
fees below the cost to sue them and avoid a lawsuit by blustering.
PGP was a challenge they didn't know how to respond to, especially since 
suing a privacy activist for a nonprofit political statement is not
exactly a good test case for a patent. What damages could they claim?
