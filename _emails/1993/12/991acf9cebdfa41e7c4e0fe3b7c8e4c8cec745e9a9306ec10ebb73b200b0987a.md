The FBI used the same stuff a couple of years back to catch the people who  
kidnapped that Exxon executive.  Considering how easy it is to pick up cellular  
transmissions and the way it works (cells with limited range), I believe it is  
something well within the resources of the FBI to develop.

I really don't think the NSA has much of a hand in any of the things we hear  
about, unless it has something directly to do with crypto (which this does not,  
except, as Lex pointed out, that escobar probably should have been using strong  
crypto...).
