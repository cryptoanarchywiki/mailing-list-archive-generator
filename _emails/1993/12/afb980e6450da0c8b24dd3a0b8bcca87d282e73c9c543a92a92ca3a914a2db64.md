Why    WHY THINGS ARE MEASURED BY NUMBERS NEAR ONE
by Michael E. Marotta
 
We naturally choose scales that are naturally in tune with 
Nature.  To do otherwise would be unharmonious and would be 
rejected by practice over time.  Here are the numbers from 
an article about the Great Lakes in the World Book Encyclopedia.
 
5       lakes
1       in US
4       border
1909    year of treaty
94,650  combined area
600     alt of Superior
245     alt of Ontario
325     drop from Erie to Ont
1900    Chicago canal opened
1,000   miles inland
20      drop in St. Mary's
3       canal groups
1959    St. Law Seaway
182     miles of Seaway
2       times more than Panama
 
Depths  Areas
1333    31,800      Superior
923     22,400      Michigan
750     23,000      Huron
210      9,930      Erie
778      7,520      Ontario
 
The numbers 4,5, and 6 are uncommon.  You can round 7,8,9 to the 
next order of magnitude and make them all 1.  This doesn't need
explanation.  Finding that measures clustered near 5 would...
