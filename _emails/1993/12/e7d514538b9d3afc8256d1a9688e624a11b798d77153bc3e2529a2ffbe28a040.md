And now that Defense Secretary Inman has issued that Martial Law
Measure that crypto work is "born classified," the recent raids on
most of the Cypherpunks seem to make more sense. And the recent
progress in factoring, using the "rubber hose algorithm," has made
most private cryptography moot.

Um,  Could you elaboreate on this some Mr. May?

I would be very interested in the specifics, it might affect my
travel plans...
