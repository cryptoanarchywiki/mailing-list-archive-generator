Are there any Cypherpunks in the Midwest Region that would like to hold 
a meeting?  I'd like to interact face-to-face for once.  I'm located 
just north of Cincinatti in Oxford, OH, and would probably be able to 
host something.  Unfortunately, this probably isn't very central.

I've brought this up before, but didn't get enough response to put a 
meeting togethor, so... I'm trying again.

Please e-mail me directly if you are interested, with a clear, loud 
subject so I can differentiate you from the noise.

hanging in Ohio,
- -john.
