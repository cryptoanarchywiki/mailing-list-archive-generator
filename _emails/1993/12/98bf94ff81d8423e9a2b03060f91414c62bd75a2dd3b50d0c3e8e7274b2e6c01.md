 Dear Slick,
	as you can see from (enclosed copy of your) message,
	electronic communications are NOT secure without
	free enterprise encryption and signatures.

	I hope Bobby Inmann doesnt put too much presure
	on you to go with some stupid idea like Clipper.

	Lets not let America be an embarrased second rate
	country when it comes to electronic security.

	FREE CRYPTO!

 -- Charlie Merritt
