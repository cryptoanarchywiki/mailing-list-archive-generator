I've just started an ftp site with a USA/Canada distribution policy for
crypto software.  Nothing can totally prevent the theft of data from
this site, or ripem.msu.edu or rsa.com, but I decided that I would
exercise my right to publish within the USA anyway.  About the best
I can do without demanding to see proof of citizenship in person (and
even that could be forged) is to make it very difficult to get the data
without reading a warning notice first, and hope that a combination of
conscience along with the possibility of the actions being traced by
the U. S. Government and/or the government of the perpetrator's 
country will limit the number of violations.

anonymous ftp to csn.org and read mpj/README.MPJ for details.  There
is also the Colorado Catacombs BBS (303-938-9654) crypto areas that I
hope to expand.
