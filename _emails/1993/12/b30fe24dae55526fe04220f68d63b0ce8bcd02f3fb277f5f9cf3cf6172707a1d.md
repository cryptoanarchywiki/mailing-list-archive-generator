He was head of MCC in Austin for several years and then his own
company, a kind of high-tech holding company (Westmark was the name, I
think).

I recall seeing a company selling crypto products, "Ultron," in 1988
or so, and noting the mention that it was a division of Inman's
company, Westmark.

I've followed Inman's career since I first heard of him in 1979,
during the crypto flap, and especially since reading about him in 1982
in "The Puzzle Palace."
