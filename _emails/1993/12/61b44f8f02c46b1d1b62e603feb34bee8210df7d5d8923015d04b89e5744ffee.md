 Well no doubt they have his True_Name now. I'm curious as to why
they are so adamant about trying to break the encryption? I get the
impression they don't have much of a case. Don't forget kids to
save those sniffer tracings, they could earn you valuable prizes!

 I won't even go into how dumb it is to try accessing a cracked
system through a single cutout, kids don't try this at home ;)
