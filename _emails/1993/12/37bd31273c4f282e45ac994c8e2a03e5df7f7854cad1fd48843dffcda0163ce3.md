>*[Starman]* I don't know who you are, but you aren't welcome here.
>
>*[Starman]* BTW, all your msg's are being ignored.
>
>Again, this is as close as I can remember it.

>
>I could understand this if I had insulted [Starman] or his mother, but for

>
>Doesn't this seem like over-reacting to you???
>
>Therefore, I bring this before a forum of all those who attend #anime!
>regularly, semi-regularly, or those who have only joined once.
>
>I believe that [Starman] has over-reacted and is acting immaturely by kicking

>
>I wish to have the ban dropped and be re-admitted to #anime!, for I feel I have
