Look, there's one advantage to not banning LD from the list; he generally
posts under his own or his well-known anonymous names, which makes it easier
to filter them. Recently, though, either he or someone else has started
reforwarding his rants through a remailer, which I cannot filter on (unless
I go to content filtering, which I'd prefer to avoid).

If someone other than LD is forwarding his rantograms via remailers, Please
Cease And Desist. If it's Detweiller himself, well, he's obviously not going
to listen to me. (Of course, I haven't been accused of being a tentacle; I
must not be important enough.)

Jason
