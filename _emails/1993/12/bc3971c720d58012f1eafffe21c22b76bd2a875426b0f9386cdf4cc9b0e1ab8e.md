(I offered in E-mail to send Fred what he's looking for.)

I've got C-punks list traffic stored back as far as late September. It 
wouldn't be a big deal to make .ZIPs of each month's collected postings, 
if someone wants to make them available for FTP. Are people strongly 
opposed to making old postings available? (I'm not offering to go through 
and pull out messages from particular individuals. If enough people hate 
the idea, I won't offer public access to any of the stored postings once 
they expire out of my news-spool area. C-punks is gated to a local 
newsgroup on my sparsely populated BBS.)
