Prove it.  Sans guns there's not much private institutions can do.  That's 
the problem with letting leftists hang around here.  (Just kidding folks.) 
 They're not worried about governments with nukes and centuries of a 
tradition of slaughtering millions of people but they are worried about 
private entities who've hardly killed anyone.  Most NGO (non governmental 
organization) problems are actually misclassifications.  Analysts 
confusing NGO+Government conspiracies with NGOs alone.  

I can live next to a Chevy dealer for 80 years without him sending armed 
men next door to my house to get me to buy a car.  Bell Atlantic is a bad 
thing only because it used to have a government granted local loop 
monopoly.  Since that monopoly is as dead as a doornail no matter what 
Bell Atlantic or the government thinks about the matter, BA (and indeed 
the government itself) are just market actors.  As soon as we (and they) 
recognize their new status, we'll be better off.

May you live in interesting times.
