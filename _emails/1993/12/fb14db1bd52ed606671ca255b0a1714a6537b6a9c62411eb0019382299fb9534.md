	 I remember a referance to Sun's secure RPC where the puplic key
	 was "insecure" because the it did not use a large "key" (to few bits?)
	.

	 does anyone one have info on this?

Yup.  The modulus is too small, and the key exchange was cryptanalyze
by LaMacchia and Odlyzko.  See

@article{nfscrack,
   author = {Brian A. LaMacchia and Andrew M. Odlyzko},
   journal = {Designs, Codes, and Cryptography},
   pages = {46--62},
