As a more frequent user of IRC, I agree with you.  However, the problem is
generally technical.  This system was established because IRC channels have
no "home" server or organization which can claim "ownership" and
"responsibility" for the behavior and content of the channel.

I would prefer a system of "talkers" and "listeners".  The channel
administration, whatever this may be, decides who can talk and who must
listen.  There is a tentative first step toward this goal in the current
wave of server revisions.
