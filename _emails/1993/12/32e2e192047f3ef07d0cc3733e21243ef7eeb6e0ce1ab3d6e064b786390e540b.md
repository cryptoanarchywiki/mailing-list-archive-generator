Ultron is around the San Jose area, a manufacturerer of a Type I CCEP
chip, comprised of a classified piece of silicon contained in a 68 pin
PGA package along with a 8741 family single chip computer.  Ultron also
appears to be the originator of the crypto ignition key (speculation).

I recall seeing adds for the chip in Electronics, circa 1985-6.
