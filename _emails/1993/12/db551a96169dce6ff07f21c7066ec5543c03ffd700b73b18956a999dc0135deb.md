There has been some question as to whether I really want to prevent
Secure Drive export, or whether I just want to maintain "plausible
deniability" and dodge the ITAR. As for what I requested involving
the export of the program:

From the ad posted to newsgroups:
=============
The program is Copylefted under the GNU General Public License, and source
code in C and assembly language is included. This program is free and
always will be. This program may be freely distributed within the U.S.
and Canada; do not export it.

Cypherpunks Write Code!

To receive your copy: send e-mail to <mikeingle@delphi.com>
Specify uuencode or pgp ascii armor formats. I will make a list
and broadcast the code. U.S./Canada addresses only, please.
=============
Clear enough? And from the documentation in the ZIP file, under 
"Hazards to Avoid":
=============
Exporting this program. This program is for use in the US and Canada only.
Cryptography is export controlled, and sending this program outside the
country may be illegal. Don't do it.
=============

Several foreigners have tried to talk me into smuggling the program
out of the country, usually by sending me either a PGP message or
a PGP key and a subject line like "you know what". They have all
received nastygrams, in clear for the benefit of any eavesdroppers.
I am serious about preventing export of the program, and I'd like
to see it on sites which verify a U.S. or Canadian address before
sending the program. While we may disagree with the ITAR, I have no
desire to be the test case!

Just today I got a one-line request from someone at DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL 
for information about the program. What does anyone make of this?

Being on the list when this was written makes that kind of hard.
I don't want the program exported, or distributed in such a way
as to lead to its export.

>will just pretend he didn't see this series of posts so he can

>"leak" overseas like PGP did.

I do not approve letting it "leak out of the country".

Yes, but PGP is already worldwide. If Secure Drive did appear on a
foreign site, I would send that site administrator a message asking
him to take it off.

If you do this, please make it a U.S./Canada only site.

>So far I still haven't heard from Eric. I did get two responses.

I'd like to see more about this, in private mail if you don't want
to post it to the list.

But the bad guys might try to make it mine. That I don't want.

     Thank you. Fortunately Eric didn't do it.

The non-distribution of the beta was because I had no way to check it,
and it could easily have eaten hard drives. I did say in the ad that
you were not to export, although I didn't make anyone send a statement.
Maybe I should have.

"If you don't want to see it on the front page, don't put it in writing..."

I spelled out clearly that I wanted the program to be distributed widely
within the U.S. and Canada. By the net, I meant users in those countries.
I did not say I wanted it to leak out of the country, nor did I imply that.

>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Be careful what you sign. The ease of forging on the internet would make
a great defense in court. A signature could hang you.

This would be funny if it weren't so plausible. Try not to give them 
too many ideas. I'm also thinking about whether America will be a 
good place to live much longer.
