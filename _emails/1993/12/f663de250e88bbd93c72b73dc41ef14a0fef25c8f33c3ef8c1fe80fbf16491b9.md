I saw this a few days ago in the Guardian.  Big front page
splash, and lots of radio coverage.  The system is called
"Mondex".  I'm looking into it, myself, as I know about as much
as you do.

Midlands Bank is cooperating in the scheme, which is not
surprising, as they already have shared-ATM agreements.

Interestingly, none of the press coverage even mentioned the
*issue* of privacy.  I've told Tom Burroughes at the East
Anglian Daily Times (tom@reptile.demon.co.uk); he's deputy chief
reporter there, and was a speaker at ECFP '93.  He's looking
into it now; if you wish to speak to him, call 0473-230-023 and
ask for him in the newsroom.  He may be out, as he's also chief
court and legal reporter, but he always calls back.

I'll be calling Australia in a few minutes to see if I can raise
Simon Davies, who's out there on business.  Simon
(davies@privint.demon.co.uk) is director of Privacy
International, and was another ECFP speaker... the most
well-connected privacy advocate I've ever met.
