Commuters should expect random delays of between 0 and 20 minutes on the 93
(the 128.32.182.93, or cicada.berkeley.edu) remailer.

I'm starting my project of modifying my remailers to thwart traffic
analysis, so as the first step I put in a random delay.  The next step is to
add an "ignore me" header command and also a "bounce me to neverneverland"
header command.  Other header commands (all in an encrypted header, which
will have to wait until I finish configuring encrypted remail on cicada)
will say things like "chop off the last X bytes and continue" or "add X
random bytes to the message and pass it on", all with random delays.

I also want to set it up so that it just spontaneously mails stuff to random
places.
