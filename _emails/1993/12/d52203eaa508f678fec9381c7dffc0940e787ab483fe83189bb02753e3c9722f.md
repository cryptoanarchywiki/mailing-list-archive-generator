   BTW, I just called Sen. Kennedy's office.  Kennedy is on the Armed
   Services committee, and according to the secretary is in favor of the
   nomination, but I asked a staffer to ask Kennedy to ask Inman about
   how he reconciles the First Amendment with statements he's made like
   these.

I just called Sen. Kennedy's office as well.  If you're a Massachusetts
resident, consider giving them a ring and talking to a staffer.  If
enough people do this, Sen. Kennedy might actually ask Inman a couple of
questions on the topic.  (Which, I suspect, is the best we can hope
for; but it is *something*.)
