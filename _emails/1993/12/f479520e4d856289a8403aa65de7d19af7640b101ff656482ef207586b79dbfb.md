With any luck, and barring unforseen lawyerly problems, CFS should be
released (at least within the US) by around Xmas.  The upside is that it's
been made considerably stronger (cryptographically speaking) than the version
in the paper, and I now believe it's roughly as strong as three runs
of the underlying cipher (DES in this case) but with greatly reduced latency.

Stay tuned...
