I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here, but why are all
these keyservers being forced to shut down?  The possession of
PGP *keys* should be perfectly legal, no?  Or is the logic the
same as that used to close down drug paraphernalia shops: if
people are buying bongs, they must be smoking pot, and so we
can't allow it?

And exactly what grounds does PKP have for suing?  Is it because
the servers themselves are using PGP, rather than just storing
keys?  What if a server is using a legal (ViaCrypt) copy of PGP?
(Problem: this argument can only be used for DOS boxes currently.)
