This quote is a classic! The first bit about criminalizing crypto when it is
used to cover up criminal activity is all right, I guess - sort of like 
adding a charge of 'resisting arrest' to the list of charges filed against
a criminal. However, Inman segues from that statement into the 'registry
of institutions that can legally use cyphers'... hmmm.. as if the illegal
uses of cryptography were so tempting that 'institutions' have to jump through
hoops to demontrate their innocence [as opposed to the assumption that they
will behave themselves of their own accord]. Then, the last sentence ices 
the cake: "If you get somebody using one who isn't registered, then you go 
after him." Warm up the tanks and load the tear gas, BATF! 'Presumption of
innocence' be damned! Cryptography is a _munition_, right? Right? Hmm......

It never ceases to amaze me how Big Brother can leap from nice, harmless-
sounding 'law and order' rhetoric to police-state strong-arm statements in
the space of a single 'sound bite'.
