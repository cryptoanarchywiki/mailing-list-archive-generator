Of course, the organization asking us "Why on earth would you want privacy,
when we can run your lives so much better if we know everything you're doing?"
is the same organization that splits up its information into categories like
SECRET, TOP SECRET, ULTRA, BURN BEFORE READING, WNINTEL, RESTRICTED DATA,
FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA, NO FOREIGN NATIONALS, FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.....
