Mike Ingle asks about digicash.  The simplest system I know of that
is anonymous is the one by Chaum, Fiat, and Naor, which we have discussed
here a few times.  The idea is that the bank chooses an RSA modulus,
and a set of exponents e1, e2, e3, ..., where each exponent ei represents
a denomination and possibly a date.  The exponents must be relatively
prime to (p-1)(q-1).  PGP has a GCD routine which can be used to check
for valid exponents.

As with RSA, to each public exponent ei corresponds a secret exponent
di, calculated as the multiplicative inverse of ei mod (p-1)(q-1).  Again,
PGP has a routine to calculate multiplicative inverses.

In this system, a piece of cash is a pair (x, f(x)^di), where f() is a
one-way function.  MD5 would be a reasonable choice for f(), but notice
that it produces a 128-bit result.  f() should take this 128-bit output
of MD5 and "reblock" it to be an multi-precision number by padding it;
PGP has a "preblock" routine which does this, following the PKCS standard.

The way the process works, with the blinding, is like this.  The user
chooses a random x.  This should probably be at least 64 or 128 bits,
enough to preclude exhaustive search.  He calculates f(x), which is
what he wants the bank to sign by raising to the power di.  But rather
than sending f(x) to the bank directly, the user first blinds it by
choosing a random number r, and calculating D=f(x) * r^ei.  (I should
make it clear that ^ is the power operator, not xor.)  D is what he
sends to the bank, along with some information about what ei is, which
tells the denomination of the cash, and also information about his account
number.

The bank debits his account for the amount corresponding to exponent ei,
and signs D by raising it to the power di.  This leads to
E = f(x)^di * r, which is what the bank sends back to the user.  The
user divides E by r (this is done by calculating the multiplicative inverse
of r modulo the bank's modulus, and multiplying E by that), giving C=f(x)^di.
The user can then create the actual coin as (x, f(x)^di).  This should
also have some information appended to it to remember what exponent was
used (what denomination this is), so it would actually be (ei, x, f(x)^di).

There are some complications in this system.  The user may want to withdraw
several coins at once, and when he gets back the E values he needs to know
which is which (so he knows which r to divide by for each one).  So he
may want to include some unique tag with his D values he sends to the bank
and get the bank to send those back with the E values so that he can
distinguish them.

The bank will not recognize the coins (ei, x, f(x)^di) when they are
deposited (returned to the bank), due to the blinding.  But it will need
to keep a list of all the x values it has seen so far so that it can detect
double-spending.  If the ei values encode not only denominations but also
issue dates at some level, and if the cash is given a limited lifetime,
the list can be purged of old values periodically.

I do think a prototype digital cash system would not be too hard to do.
It would not have to address all of these problems right away.  The
larger problem is how to experiment in a meaningful way with diigicash
due to the difficulty in giving it value.  We've talked about this problem
before but I haven't seen any really good solutions.  Karl Barrus tried to
start up a non-anonymous cash system some months ago but there was nothing
to spend it on.  (Actually, he does have a remailer which uses his cash,
but since other remailers are free that has probably limited interest in
the for-pay remailer.)

I am continuing to work on a simple TCL interface to much of the PGP
functionality which would be needed for such a system (and for other
types of experimentation).  I have the MP library done, so the additional
entry points needed would include the MD5 one-way function, the random-
number generation, and the reblocking.  Perhaps in another week I will
have those hooks in place.  Then you could write the control software
in TCL, which would be easier for prototyping purposes since it's
interpreted.
