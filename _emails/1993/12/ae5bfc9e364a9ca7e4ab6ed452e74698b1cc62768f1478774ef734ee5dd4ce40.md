Yes, please.  Don't feel badly that you were coerced, I'm sure we
understand untenable positions.  But keeping the nature of the
coersion secret can only encourage it.

Of course, by the lack of a reason, we can only assume that whoever
'it' was, it was 'big' enough to either scare you or threaten you with
some action if you talked...
