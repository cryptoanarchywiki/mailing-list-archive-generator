Well, the compression problem that others have mentioned is going to be one
problem, and an additional problem that occurs to me is that putting the
signature mechanism into the camera may not be the best locatoin for it.  I
do not know of any work that people would want to sign (e.g. would be worth
protecting from fraud) that did not undergo some post-processing...

One idea that sort of popped into my head if people want to do
post-processing signatures has to do with something else I remember hearing
about from the media lab:  you stack all of the frames together into a sort
of cube structure (like a deck of cards, for example) and then select and
sign random number of planes from different angles that intersect this
cube.  While not impervious to the fraud you are trying to detect, it does
create a much more managable detached signature (somehow I think that
creating 4200 signatures per minute is going to end up being viewed as a
bit unwieldy... :)  I think that you could even make the plane selection
ahead of time and then do it on-the-fly as the work is being filmed.  You
just keep track of which/where planes will intersect the frame being
generated and store the results of these intersections to a buffer that is
then signed before the storage media is ejected.
