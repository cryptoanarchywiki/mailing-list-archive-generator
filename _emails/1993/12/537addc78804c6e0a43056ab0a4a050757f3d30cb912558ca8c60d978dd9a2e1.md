Just passing this on.  It should be of interest.  It may have shown up
here already, but for those that missed it, take a look-see.

>As we move into the regulatory environment, it's important to remember

>We have to have discipline. Much like the install fee problem, we cannot be

No guarantee is made as to the accuracy of this, of course.  If anyone has
any REAL information on where this came from originally, I'm all ears.
