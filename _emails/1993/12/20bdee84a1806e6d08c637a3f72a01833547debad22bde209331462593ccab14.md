I doubt if it's that simple:  I'm sure that digital movies will
use compression (mpeg, etc.).  One flipped bit could scramble the
whole frame.  Even with lossless compression, error correction would
be worth adding.

It's going to be much easier to compress to mpeg in hardware than to
design tape that can handle the required frame rate/resolution without
compression.
