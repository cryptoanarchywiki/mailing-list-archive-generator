Whoever said the human brain stores data compressed to 0.5% of its original
size, and what is its original size anyway.

I agree.  The description sounds more like this than anything else I'm
familiar with.

Paul Baclace goes on to say:
  >I wonder whether [he] includes the size of his grammar in [the claim]

0.5% is a questionable claim.  If it includes the grammar, then the grammar
must be very simple, and the data of very low entropy with respect to it --
in which case 0.5% would be an uninteresting experimental result.  If the
claim does _not_ include the size of the grammar, then the claim is useless
for evaluating this scheme.
