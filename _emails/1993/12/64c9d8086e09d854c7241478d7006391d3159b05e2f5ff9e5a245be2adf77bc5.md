Two items form recent magazines:

* "Time" (on the newstands now) has an article on the Internet and its
rapid growth and uses John Gilmore's wonderful quote: "The Internet
interprets censorship as damage and routes around it." (may not be his
exact phrasing)

* Pseudospoofing detectors? "The Economist," November 20, has an
article "Hidden Agenda" which describes how an outfit named CHI
Research in New Jersey uses its 12-year data base of U.S. patents to
determine who is really doing what. Apparently some companies try to
obscure what they're doing by using different "inventors"...sounds
fishy to me (I'd be pissed if my invention got credited to someone
else).

Anyway, CHI uses various techniques to deduce actual inventors, what
companies are doing what, etc. Then he sells the conclusions.

This fits with some of the themes we discuss here, both for our own
use and in terms of what our opponents may be doing.
