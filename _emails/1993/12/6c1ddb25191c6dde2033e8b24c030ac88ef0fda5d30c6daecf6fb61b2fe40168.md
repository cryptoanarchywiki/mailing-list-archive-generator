Indeed. My account at Delphi costs $20/ month for the first 20 hours
and $1.80/hr thereafter (plus $3/mo surcharge for Internet access
other than e-mail). The total cost is not signifigantly more than
the cost of the daily paper (yet its far more informative...).

There is a $9/hr charge for access 6am-7pm, though, so I use my
wife's account to read this and other lists (and you probably thought
I was psuedospoofing :-))
