Apparently the Natwest Bank (or some spoonerism thereof) announced
today that they were releasing digital cash in the form of some
sort of smartcard.  I have no more details - does anyone else?

Primarily I'm interested in knowing if it's *anonymous* digital
cash - knowing our govt, I suspect it's unlikely to be.  Any new
opportunities to track the masses are always gratefully received
by the powers that be...
