Why does anyone ever sign anything?  Why did I sign this?  The 
signature attaches the reputation associated w/ a particular key to
this particular block of data.  I can be certain that you will either
get exactly what I wrote, or no if what you recieved isn't.

You know this already.  The point is, attaching a signature to a
picture guarentees that a picture I create hasn't been modified w/o
people knowing that its changed since it left my hands.  My pictures
could have reputations attached to them without the use of
digital signatures.  This reputation could be used against me if a
picture is modified, and my name is still attached to it, but with no
verifiable digital signature similarly attached.

    Insert cool signature file that makes a trendy, yet bold and original
   statement about my cyberspace proficiency, then mentions that I'll send
   you my PGP public key if you want it, and you trust that I'm actually me.
