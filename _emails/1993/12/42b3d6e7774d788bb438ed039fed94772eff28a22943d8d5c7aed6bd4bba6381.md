painful is having all the hard work you've been doing for who
knows how long being trashed by bad public  opinion after some
deranged individual spread malicious propaganda about your cause
as far and wide as he can.

a mailbomb is just ascii text.  I seem to recall you bitching pretty
loudly about receiving one.  What is 'its just ASCII text'  supposed
to mean?

hmm..  little tough having to live with the consequences of a
digital reputation now isnt it?
