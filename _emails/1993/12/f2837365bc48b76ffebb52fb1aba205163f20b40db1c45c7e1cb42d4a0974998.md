Please, please don't do this without checking with the author of
the package first.  He went out of his way to say that he doesn't
want to a make it available for ftp because he doesn't want to deal with
potential export problems.  So respect his wishes; it's his work, after
all.

I'm the process of arranging the release of my own Unix crypto file system,
and am myself concerned about the export issues (as is my employer).
Messages like this one don't exactly give me a warm fuzzy feeling about
people violating their agreements to not export the code or
otherwise creating future headaches on my behalf.

If you think that an author of cryptographic software is immune from
export hassles just because it was someone else who exported it, ask
Phil Zimmermann...
