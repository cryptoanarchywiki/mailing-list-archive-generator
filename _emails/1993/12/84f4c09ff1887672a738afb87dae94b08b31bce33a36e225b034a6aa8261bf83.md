REALLY excellently stated! Great analysis of the nature of the problem.
Thank you, do you mind if I quote this to others?

Alas, though, I can not from long and bitter experience agree with you
about the solution. In the real world  physical verbal/facial expressions
of disapproval and disdain might rapidly rid the group of the problem
person, but in cyberspace, such traditional cultural prods are
non-existent. The aberrant user KNOWS he faces no meaningful penalties or
censure and thus has no inducement not to continue his chaotic ways. I do
feel that in addition to the observations you made above, that such people
often take sheer perverse delight in the mere poisoning of the creativity
of the group being creatively atrophic themselves.
