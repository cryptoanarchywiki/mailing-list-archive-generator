Well, you seem to have summerised our thoughts on the matter exactly.
We are thinking about sticking a bunch of memory in the phone
and keeping track of the last ,say 100, phones called and the public
keys that they used. One could use the readback to certify the keys.
Some sort of KCA could also be invoked. We are designing the system
for easy upgrade and modification.
