Suppose one were an anon@penet.fi subscriber, and that one were strict in
digitally signing all messages, and that one's public key were available
from the PGP public key servers, and that one conducted affairs in this
way for a lengthy period.  Would the confluence of the Email identification
in the digitally signed message with the identity on the PGP public key
along with the presumption of good identity management on the Finnish
remailer be of sufficient weight to convince you to sign one's PGP
public key?  Would existing signatures on a PGP public key influence
your decision?
