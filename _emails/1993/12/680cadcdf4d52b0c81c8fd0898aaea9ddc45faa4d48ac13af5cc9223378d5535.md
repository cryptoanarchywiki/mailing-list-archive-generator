I will be sorting through the t-shirt requests and compiling a list. It 
will be done in a few days. As soon as I finish this, I will mail 
everyone on the list, and we can start hashing out a design. I have a 
screening company I work with, and am currently working out the details 
with them. Any questions can be directed to me at <albemuth.tatertot.com> 
or <netcom.com>. Thanks.
