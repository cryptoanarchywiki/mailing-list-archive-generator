You can get by with about 2KB of static table (sbox + permutation),
assuming you lookup the sboxes 1 at a time and fold the permuation
into the table lookup.

	8 sboxes * 64 entries/sbox * 4 bytes/entry  = 2KB

For the key schedule you'll need 8 bytes/subkey * 16 subkeys = 128 bytes
(You can do it with 6 bytes/subkey, but it's easier with 8 bytes/subkey)

I suggest that you look at the "descore" implementation by Dana How. 
You can find it with archie.

Also, if the uP that you are using has direct bit addressable memory,
the permuations stop being a problem -- say 2 instructions/bit.
Obviously, permutations are real easy to do in hardware.

In addition, I suggest that you do some back of the envelope
calculations to make sure that you're going to get the kind of
throughput that you expect.  The simplest way is to work out the code
for a single round, and then multiply by 16.  This will get you in the
ball park.

Have fun!
