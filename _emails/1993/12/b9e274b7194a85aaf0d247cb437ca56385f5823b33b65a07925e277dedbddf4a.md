WHILE READING HAL'S REMAILER STATS I GOT SOMEWHAT DEPRESSED IT SEEMS
THAT I COULD EASILY CORRELATE HIS PEAKS WITH SOME OF MY REMAILER EXPERIMENTS.
BY CORRELATING WITH MY MAIL LOGS. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT .forward INITIATED
SCRIPTS THAT WOULD PING EVERY KNOWN REMAILER EVERYTIME A PIECE OF REGULAR
MAIL WAS RECEIVED(NON REMAILER PING TRAFFIC).
IT APPEARS THAT PROCMAIL WOULD BE IDEAL BUT IT DOESNT SEEM TO BE UNIVERSAL
AT EVERY SITE SO I HAVE ALSO BEEN LOOKING AT C, PERL AND TCL. IF JUST A FEW 
(1-6) ACCOUNTS AT AS FEW AS 15 SITES DID THIS IT WOULD MAKE TRAFFIC
ANALYSIS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. WHAT DO THE REST OF  THE TENTACLES THINK?
