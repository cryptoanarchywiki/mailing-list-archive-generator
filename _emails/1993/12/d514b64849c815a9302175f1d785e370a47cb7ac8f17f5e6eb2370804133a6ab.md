[ about one-time pads... ]

i like the DAT or mini-disc idea. cheap and easy... dump a bunch of 
digital noise onto two DATs. burn them when you are thru with them. i 
like it.

the problem would come when you leave the tapes lying around by accident 
instead of burning them... or if you don't go thru them frequently 
enough, still have half a tape left when your Opponent nabs it.

do you have to burn the tape for really good security? would overwriting
it be enough...? with a mini-disc it would be really easy to everwrite the
onetime pad when you are done with part of it, somewhat easy for DATs. 
(gear does exist to extract previous recordings from residual magnetics...
but is expensive from what i understand.)

DAT would be better for large files, minidisc for short messages...


man! this is a cheap and fast way to get the ball rolling...
