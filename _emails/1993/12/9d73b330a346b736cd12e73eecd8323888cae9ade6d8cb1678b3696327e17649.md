For me, paranoia runs too deep.  It's just too easy, too convenient an end
to the story -- the Bad Man dead with no chance to implicate those who
helped him.  The gov't looks good, both at home and in the US; more money
for the War on Drugz

Escobar got out of jail once; he had no reason to fear going back to jail
for a while.  I'm betting that the body in that casket is not his, that this
is his way of "retiring" from the game, and that he cut a deal with the
gov't to do it.  Note that his family was given protective custody by the
gov't less than a week ago.

We probably won't know the truth for years.
