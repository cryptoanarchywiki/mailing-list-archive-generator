I totally disagree - as far as I can tell, Detweiler is wrestling with 
some emotional issues that most people work through while they're in 
their middle-to-late teens. Problem is, he thinks Eric & Tim are his 
parents. Either he's gonna figure things out, and in a few years this is 
gonna be a really embarassing episode, or we're going to wake up one 
morning to find him on the front page of the newspaper, surrounded by 
bodies in the lobby of some post office, screaming about MEDUSA and 
TENTACLES and FAKE MAIL and SODOMY and DRUGS.

As I see it, it's either 2.5 kids, a station wagon, and a house in the 
suburbs for him - or getting shot by a SWAT team. I'd say the odds are 
about 50/50.
