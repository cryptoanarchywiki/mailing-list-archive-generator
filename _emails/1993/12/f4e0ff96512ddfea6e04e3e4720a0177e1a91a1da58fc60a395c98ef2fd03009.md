   P.O. Box may be not the safest way of collecting the money;
encrypted anonymous cash transactions would be much better;
also, one can not only advertize on the net, but provide the
service.
   Suppose I open a virtual store selling illegal/copyrighted
info - software, music, movies, porn, etc.  Pirates receive
royalties from the stuff they upload; customers, naturally,
pay.  All anonymous and encrypted and based on a network of
hard-to close (offshore?) remailers.
 
   The potential revenues from such a store seem well worth
the effort of setting it up.
 
   The question is how can they close it?
