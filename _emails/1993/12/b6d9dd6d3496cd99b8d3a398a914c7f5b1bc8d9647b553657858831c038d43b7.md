Hi, glad you liked my stuff.  Just for the yell of it,
here's my latest atrocity, based on a hackers' in-joke
(would you believe, my very first computer filk?).

    P.G.P.   words: L. Fish
                (c)12/18/93
             tune: ditto

The G-men all are cryin'
And tearin' out their hair,
'Cause there's a new cryptography
That's shown up everywhere.
Nobody can break it,
However good they be.
Everybody's PC got the PGP.

It guarantees who's callin'
And just who gets the call.
If you ain't got your code-word,
You can't get in at all.
Oh, there ain't nothin' like it
To keep your privacy.
Half the world's computers got the PGP.

There's not a way to crack it,
Not in a hundred years.
All the spooks & wiretappers
Are cryin' in their beers.
They can't spy on E-mail
Here or oversea
When every home computer's got the PGP.

Bless the man who made it,
And pray that he ain't dead.
He could've made a million
If he'd sold it to the feds,
But he was hot for freedom;
He gave it out for free.
Now every common citizen's got PGP.

So go say what you want to,
Of love or war or hate,
Kinky sex, or dirty words,
Or overthrow the state.
Nobody can stop you.
Speech is really free
When everybody's PC got the PGP.


    Whee!  Enjoy!  ...And if anybody out there knows how to
adapt PGP for the Atari 130XE, please get me a floppy.
Thanx.

"Society has recognized over time that certain kinds of scientific inquiry
can endanger society as a whole and has applied either directly, or through
scientific/ethical constraints, restrictions on the kind and amount of
research that can be done in those areas."

--Adm. Bobby R. Inman in a February, 1982 article for _Aviation Week and
Space Technology_ on why cryptographic research should be limited to
government scientists.  Full text of this article is available for
