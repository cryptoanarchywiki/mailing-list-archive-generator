I have purchased the VIACRYPT MSDOS package and would value some "DON"T 
DO THIS"/"DO DO THIS " as i am completely unfamiliar with using V_PGP and
would benefit from the mistakes and learning curves of others.
I would also find it valuable to have some people to contact outside the
c-punks list with the trivial "what"s zis" kind of questions
Thanks fo rthe responses.
SYL
