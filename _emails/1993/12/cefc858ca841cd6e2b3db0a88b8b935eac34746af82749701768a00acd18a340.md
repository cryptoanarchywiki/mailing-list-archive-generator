To interupt the Monster in the name of Cypherpatriot Activity...
 
I plan on starting up a security and consulting firm over the next
few months.  A great deal of what we will address are practical
applications of crypto technology.  Due to the fact that pre-LD
experience with this list has showed a great deal of impressive
peole or net.entities out there, I would like those interested in
getting involved with an upstart (and yet comprehensive) corporation
to contact me.
 
The corporation will deal with all aspects of information security including
telco product security, data integrity, data security, communication
security, and general computer consultations.  If you are interested,
or have any ideas you think are ready for commercialization, let me know.
 
Cypherpunks Start Corporations!  (No longer merely write code).
