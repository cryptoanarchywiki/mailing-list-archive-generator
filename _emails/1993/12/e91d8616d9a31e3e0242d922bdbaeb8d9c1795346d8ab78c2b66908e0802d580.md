Punks'
	Actually Mike Ingle has commented on his position on the 
distribution of Secure Drive.  He asked that it not be placed for anonftp 
just because of the fact that he doesn't want ot run the same kind of 
risk that PRZ is currently in...

I didn't save a copy of the msg but I'm sure that some one did.
