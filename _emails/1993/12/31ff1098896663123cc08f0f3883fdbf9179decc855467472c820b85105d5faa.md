Detweiler already has another list ('cypherwonks') that is looking into issues
like electronic democracy, cyberspatial ethics, etc. Is this the sort of thing
you had in mind? I don't know whether he actually moderates the list in the 
sense of filtering the postings, but he bills himself as the 'cypherwonks
janitor' in the welcome message and certainly takes an active interest in the
progress of the discussions.
