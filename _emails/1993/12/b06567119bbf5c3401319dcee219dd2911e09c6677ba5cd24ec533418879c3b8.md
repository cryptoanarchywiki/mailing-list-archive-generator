For those interested, I have constructed a powerful computer
completely out of wood chips soaked in brine. The toughest part was
the display. Please send $117.43 cash to me if you would like to get
in on the ground floor of this novel enterprise. TAKE CHARGE. PROTECT
YOURSELF FROM THE GOV!

To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time
And all be happy to see the nice young men in their clean white suits....
