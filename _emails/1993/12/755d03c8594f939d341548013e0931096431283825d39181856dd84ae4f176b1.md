NEUTERS - Botoga 3.12.93
 
Police and military officials announced yesterday that they had help from
American National Security Agency officials in tracking down Pablo Escobar.  The
NSA provided Columbian officials with the tools necessary to decipher
communication between the Columbian drug lord and his cohorts.  Escobar
had been communicating by computer using the American Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
software product which was compromised by NSA officials working at a remote
listening station in the Columbian jungle.
