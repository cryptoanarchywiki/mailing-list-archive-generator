Well, this is likely to happen in any cash implementation where the
gubmint/bank does not purposely inflate the currency.  However it's not
necessarily bad - after all, if people can make money at digicash that's
not government tampered with (inflated), they'll be more people willing
to do it.  Of course, this will lead to fierce competition, likely to
the point where you can earn interest on the cash in your wallet! 
Either that or, have a independant digicash system which is introduced
at the price of $1 for one digibuck, and then allowed to fluctuate, and
rise.  After a few years you might be able to sell your digibucks for $2
apiece, or more. :)

Nobody's forcing you to use their digicash system, so you could demand
whatever disclosure you wanted, or take your business elsewhere.

Probably not, but some people are stupid.
