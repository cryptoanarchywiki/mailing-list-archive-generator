I'm doing this for unix this weekend.  One very important point to
note:  only take *one* bit of random data per keystroke, and take
it by ex-oring every single bit in the clock() value - that way you
make sure the randomly fluctuating one is in there - because on
some systems the bottom bit might always be 0, if the resolution
of the clock is low.  Also, think about the problems if you have
a function that returns milliseconds but the hardware clock is one
tick, say, every 1/17 sec...
