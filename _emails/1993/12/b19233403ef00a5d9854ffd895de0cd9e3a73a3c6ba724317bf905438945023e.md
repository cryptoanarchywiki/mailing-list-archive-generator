Hi everyone,

As some of you are aware I have been looking at stego, in particular trying
to calculate the maximum feasible message to insert in a given image. I have
determined some techniques that help predict this ratio. In the process of
testing them I got side-tracked into converting images to other format (RGB >
HSV in this case). Since these are linear but not equaly scaled there is some
range alteration in the conversion process. It appears that if a RGB image is
holding a image it converts to HSV differently and is thus easy to test for.

I am in need of some additional data and basiclly clueless where to find it.
The data falls into one of the following ways:

    > source of images in both HSV and RGB format

    > pd or shareware software that will convert mathematicaly

    > access to a video color registration set to generate the above
      database

Any help in locating any one of these would be greatly appreciated.

Have a Merry Christmas!
