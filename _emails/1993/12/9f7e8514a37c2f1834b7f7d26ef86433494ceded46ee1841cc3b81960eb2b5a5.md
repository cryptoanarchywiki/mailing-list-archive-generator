The FFT and inverse FFT operationes are not lossless processes.
When you transform a signal you are dealing with floating
point numbers and you lose some information by rounding errors.
You could put some signal in the high freq portion of the
signal but it wont be as simple as XOR'ing values.

This sounds interesting.  How about detection,  how will some
random phase relationships stand out against normal phase of
various frequencies?
