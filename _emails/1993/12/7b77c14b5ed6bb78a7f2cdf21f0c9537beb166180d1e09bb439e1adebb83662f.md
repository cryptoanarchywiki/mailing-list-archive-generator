Since Cypherpunks write code...

My Mac encryption software is ready for beta! Anybody out there interested in 
taking a look-see and giving me some feedback?

I incorporated into the software almost all the advice I received in response 
to my request a month ago for advice about the encryption algorithm, and it 
seems pretty good to me (I've added cryptographically random IV's and encrypted 
header data). But I'd be especially interested in feedback on 
weaknesses/improvements.

The program is a System 7 _only_ conventional encryption application, using 
IDEA CFB. It works drop-and-drag, encrypts files, folders, or whole volumes, 
allowing pass phrases up to 255 characters in length, and has a small variety 
of hip features. The program is freeware and (of course) comes with source 
code. It's called "Curve Encrypt".

I've created a software company 'nym, "Curve Software", with an associated PGP 
public key for release verification (enclosed here). Note that I'd appreciate 
correspondence relating to the software sent to kinney@bogart.colorado.edu, so 
I can keep it separate from my other mail.

I will only distribute this software within the U.S. I do not want to fuck with 
ITAR. Please respect this.

E-mail me if you want the code.
