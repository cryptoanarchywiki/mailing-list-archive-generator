	 If you record - say - 5 of them and send them by 5 seperate couriers
	 and xor them together to send the message, your enemy has to
	 compromise etc 5 people.

Or your enemy has to penetrate your site or your correspondent's site,
and copy five CD-ROMs instead of one.

CD-ROMs have one advantage:  there's a lot of data.  But that's not
all good, because you *really* want to destroy any keying material
you've ever used.

I've heard People Who Know say that in the spook and government world,
one-time pads are falling out of favor --- because their practical
security isn't as good as a really high quality conventional cipher with
a dynamically-negotiated session key.  I repeat:  *practical* security;
your enemy isn't going to hit you or bribe you with a copy of Shannon's
theorems.
