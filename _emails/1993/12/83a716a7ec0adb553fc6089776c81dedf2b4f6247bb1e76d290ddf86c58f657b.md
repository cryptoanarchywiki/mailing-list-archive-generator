I use a variation on the below whenever I get a telemarketer calling -- 
but instead of asking for the home number, I just ask for their number, 
meaning work number.  Amazingly, it's very effective.  Apparently 
outbound telemarketers often don't want to get inbound phone calls.

| An idea that I have never used, but was suggested to me by my father, goes
| like this:
|
| RING RING
|
| me: Hello
|
| ??: Mr. Peter Baumbach, I am calling from ICK inc. to offer you ..
|
| me: Excuse me, but I am busy right now. Could you give me your name and
|    home phone number, and I will call you back later?
|
| ??: Huh? I can't give you my home number, that's private.
|
| me: But you know my name and number.  This hardly seems fair.
