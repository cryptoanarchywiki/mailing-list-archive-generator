If your signature does not include the low order bits of your image,
then someone could embed a secret message in those low order bits
(via Romana Machado's "Stego," for example) and your signature still
would be valid.  I wouldn't want my signature over someone else's
steganized message.

I'm sure there's a simple fix for that, such as ensuring enough bit rot
to blow away any but the most error-tolerant steganography or including
a disclaimer of responsibility for the low-order bits, but I couldn't
resist pointing it out.
