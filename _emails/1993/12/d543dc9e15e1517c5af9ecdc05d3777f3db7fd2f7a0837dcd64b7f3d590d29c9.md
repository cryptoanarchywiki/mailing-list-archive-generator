Is there anything inherently superior about CD-ROMs as a one-time
pad ? The size differential vis a vis Bernouli drive cartridges,
floptical disk drives, or just plain old floppy disks is kind of a
mixed blessing, and still doesn't answer the major question with
one-time pads - secure dissemination.
