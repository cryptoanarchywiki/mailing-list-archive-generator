The point is not that B. Dolan's proposed cash is bad, it is that better
systems exist.  Chaum's blinded c{sh is simiXoar to Dolan's proposal, but
with the added feature that the "passwords" that~r authorize access to
the bank account can be altered by the users so that the bank does not
recognize them later, while still allowing the bank to verify that the
"passwords" are valid.  This eliminates the trackability allowed by Dolan's
proposal.
