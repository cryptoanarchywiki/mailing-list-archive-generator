The most bogus problem of the remailer system is lack of traffic. I mean how 
many messages go thru a given remailer a day? 1? 10? 100? This makes it
pitifully easy to track messages. Padding them to the same size helps but if 
you have to track ten messages around (even though the problem becomes more 
egregious at each site) so what. Queing is a drag if you have to wait a day
to get enough mail to send out. If I wanted it to take that long I'd send it 
snail mail. More traffic = shorter que time needed to make things a bummer 
for trackers. Random traversing messages are a reasonable temporary solution 
but Remailer publicity (thus, more traffic) is an important part of getting 
better anonymity going. Tell your friends, send all your punk postings thru 
at least one remailer (that will put some traffic through them!).

This method is a passive one, how can we subvert the system now in place to 
make traffic more invisible?

If you believe this you've already seceded the battle to the NSA. Formidable 
opponents != Defeat. Great respect for NSA ability is neccesary but
independent minds (especially working together) can exhibit Davidian 
qualities. 

Exactly, how is tracking done? I've heard the general issues of file size 
and physical compromise but what programs and access codes are needed to 
obtain such info? How does one access SMTP mail channels, sendmail ques and 
mail logs? How can we subvert their attempts? Can we use the known router 
algorithms and network bookkeeping methods at hop sites to disguise where 
messages are traveling?

I guess what I'm saying is can we use the complexities of the system itself,
rather than our own system alone to make traffic analysis a drag. We know the 
weakness of our system, what are the weaknesses of the analyzers systems. 
What are the possibilities for an analyzers systems, how do we attack
them? I'll start by looking at various RFC's but a little offense rather
than defense can only make us more aware. Even if it doesn't seem possible
for goliath to lose.

I think today I'll be:

Stranger
