Well, if Inman goes down I suppose I will do some rejoicing.  However, this
is also kind of depressing.  Something as important as a Cabinet nomination
can be wiped out by something that is really irrelevant (have you ever
looked into just how *hard* it is to employ a nanny on the books?); while
we all acknowledge that our really serious concerns will have no effect.
Anybody who is concerned about freedom in this country should ought to be
pretty scared when decisions this important are made in this way.

Not that this example is anything particularly new...
