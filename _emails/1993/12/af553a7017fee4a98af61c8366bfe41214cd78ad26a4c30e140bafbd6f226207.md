 *Fuse*: (n) 1) Software or hardware to isolate a net, system or 
 subsystem in the event of detection of a security or resource
 use problem.  2) reputation.

 *Crowbar*: (n) Type of _cannibal_ that, on detecting a
 security or resource use problem, blows _fuses_ in outside 
 systems by flooding communications channels with noise,
 triggering security checks in other systems, and/or exhausting
 bank accounts, credit lines and stores of _e-cash_.  The effect
 of a crowbar is harder to reset by a presumed intruder than
 that of an internal fuse.  A countermeasure to _mug shots_.

 *Mug Shots*: (n) Backups of the state of a system to allow
 repeated attempts at cracking it.  A countermeasure to 
 _cannibals_.

 *Runaway*: (n) Endless echoing of messages caused by bugs
 in routing software.  Usually refers to a bug that exacerbates
 its own trigger conditions, such as traffic level or lack of
 storage space.
