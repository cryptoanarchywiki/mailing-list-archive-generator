Why do you constantly use different usernames for an12070, and have
them espouse contradictory positions?  To increase the number of
apparently-distinct identities which you control!  You are
attempting to BLUDGEON your opponents into abject cringing
SUBMISSION through the sheer force of DEMOCRATIC NUMBERS.

You know, you're going to be really embarrassed when you come to
your senses.  Think about this for a minute.  Do you have *any*
grounds for believing that we're all the same person?  Let me make
you an offer: pick the two people whom you think are most clearly a
single person.  Test your hypothesis.  If you prove that they are
the same, I will publically apologize to you and denounce
"pseudospoofing".  If you cannot do so within a pre-agreed time
limit, you will stop ranting.  Making such a proof should not 
be too hard -- after all, people connected you and S.Boxx within
a week or two.

"Any knowledge" indeed.  I am MEDUSA, the controller of ALL TENTACLES.
