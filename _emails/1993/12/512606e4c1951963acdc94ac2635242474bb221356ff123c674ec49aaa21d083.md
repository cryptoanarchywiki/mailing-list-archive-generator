Assuming the arrest warrant was good not revealing the key to a duly
authorized court representative would be illegal (ie interfereing with a
police investigation). If the courts serve a warrant for your arrest and the
confiscation of data on your hard drive (and you refuse to turn the data over
even after talking w/ an attorney) is specificaly mentioned you are opening
yourself up for another whole world of legal hurt.

A citizen would have the legal right to refuse prior to talking w/ an
attorney but not after, at that point it becomes witholding evidence.


If the process is legal there should be no reason a citizen can refuse to
turn over his private keys (I don't believe self-incrimination holds here).
