As far as I know, a system like SecureDrive, KFS, or CFS, is really only as  
secure as the running machine is.  Generally, when a BBS is 'seized'  
(forfeited? ;), it is running when the feds get there.  Right now, if they have  
any clue (and from what I hear, the FBI has much more of a clue than the SS  
when it comes to this type of investigation), they usually take pictures of the  
setup to make sure they can put the machine back together when they get it to  
wherever they are taking it to.  If encrypting file-systems become a problem, a  
disk could be developed (probably pretty easily) to retrieve the key from  
memory before they power it down.
