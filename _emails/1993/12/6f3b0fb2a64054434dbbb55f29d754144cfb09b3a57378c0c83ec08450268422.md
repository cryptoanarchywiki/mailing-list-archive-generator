It is NOT alright.  Such a "law" would be a blatant violation of the 5th
Amendment.  There is virtually no difference between criminalizing the use
of cryptography to "hide" criminal activity, and criminalizing the failure
of every criminal that every used a phone in the commission of crime to
send a recording of the conversation to the FBI, w/o even having to be
asked to do so, and before the cops even knew an alleged crime had or
would occur.

Just so.

I think the crypto-anarchists among us would say that's the nature of the
beast.  I honestly think most of the 'law and order' rhetoric is
heartfelt.  I'm pretty sure that most control-freaks really do believe
they are doing it 'for your own good', and see themselves as knights in
shining armor.  I guess I've just never had much faith in conspiracy
theories.  This is not to say such people are to be trusted, however.

Two old sayings come to mind here: never ascribe to malice what can be
adequately explained by stupidity or ignorance; and, if you ever meet
someone who says they want to 'protect' you or want to do something 'for
your own good', run away as fast as possible - this person is dangerous.
