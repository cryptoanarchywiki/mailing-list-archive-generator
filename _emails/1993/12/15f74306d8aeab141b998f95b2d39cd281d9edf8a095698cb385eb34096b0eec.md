The very first entry of the Cyberspace Lexicon, *autolott* is well on its
way to becoming a reality.  An Associated Press story, "Is lottery by
phone the ticket?" was on the front page of my local paper today.  The
article describes a proposed plan to establish a lottery where one would
select numbers and pay for tickets via a touch-tone phone.  The system
would involve depositing money in a special account which the lottery
commission could also access.  The system could be set to purchase tickets
when the jackpot reaches certain levels automatically.

"Players could bet until their accounts are depleted, withdraw mopney
anytime and replenish their accounts by check, electronic transfer, or
credit card."

It does state that "each wager would carry a $2 service charge."  It
souldn't be long before they realize they save more money by not printing
the tickets.

I don't have time to type in the whole article, but I think you get the
picture.  Six states are already interested.  I'm surprised they didn't
suggest just setting it up as a 900 number, or are there laws against that?

So how long will it be before Las Vegas goes on-line?  Call 1-800-LOAN-YES
for easy credit extensions today!

    Insert cool signature file that makes a trendy, yet bold and original
   statement about my cyberspace proficiency, then mentions that I'll send
   you my PGP public key if you want it, and you trust that I'm actually me.
