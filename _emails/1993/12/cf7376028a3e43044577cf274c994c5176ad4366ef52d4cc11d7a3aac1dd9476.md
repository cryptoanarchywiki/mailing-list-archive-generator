Does anybody out there know what the status of the Grand Jury case
against Mike Ingle is, the case involving the export to SecureDrive?

I'd heard he was being investigated and all his records had been
subpoenaed, with Janet Reno saying a whole new wing at Marion is being
built for Zimmermann, Ingle, Karns, Hughes, and all the other
cryptocriminals.

And now that Defense Secretary Inman has issued that Martial Law
Measure that crypto work is "born classified," the recent raids on
most of the Cypherpunks seem to make more sense. And the recent
progress in factoring, using the "rubber hose algorithm," has made
most private cryptography moot.

Me, I'm just glad I got out in '94 before they closed the borders.
