Peter,

Since this description is of a more general interest, I am cc'ing this
thread back to the list.

Let {x} be a hash on x.  Let S_A{x} be encryption of the hash of x with
Alice's secret key, i.e., Alice's signature over x.  Thus, a signed 'thing'
is (x, S_A{x}).

If {x} yields the function f(y) which tells how different y is from x
(ostensibly to measure what damage x sustained in transit, to become y),
then f(y) can be exploited to find y such that {y} = {x} (this is, after
all, the design criteria behind f(y)).  If {x} = {y} then S_A{y} = S_A{x},
and therefore I can publish a document signed by Alice (y, S_A{y}), without
her knowledge (both meanings) or cooperation.

Someone on the list showed a few months back that provably few errors (or
abitrary attacker introduced changes) are needed to get to a matching hash,
but finding the changes to introduce is expensive.  Building a hash
function such that a distance measure is easy to calculate and exploit,
makes finding the right errors easier, and thus allows falsified
signatures.  I take x, introduce my required changes yielding y, and then
exploit f(y) with say a genetic search, or simulated annealing, to find y'
such that {y'} = {x}, then I republish (y', S_A{x}): my altered
document/image/whatever, + some errors to make the hashes match, + Alice's
original signature.  The signature is verifiable.
