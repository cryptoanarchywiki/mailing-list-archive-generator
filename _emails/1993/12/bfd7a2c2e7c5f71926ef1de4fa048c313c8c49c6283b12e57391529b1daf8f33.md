You know,

your article would have been excellent without the typical anti-drug
rhetoric.  It almost seemed like you were just using the medusa
analogy to make cypherpunks the proper forum for your rant.

The war on drugs in the United States (which I become more and more
hesitant about capitalizing) is the single most effective weapon
against privacy today.

You really need to seek attention elsewhere.

Too bad Melody didn't get some better acid.
She'd have saved us all a lot of trouble.
Arguement for legalization if you ask me.
