Okay. I have compiled a list of people interested in the shirt...If you 
are not on the list, and are interested, mail me.

As for a design, we have a design we are working with, available (a rough
draft) via anon ftp. If you have a better idea, or would like to take a 
crack at designing it, let me know and we can put these designs up as 
well. A sort of "vote for the best design". 

Also, Jef Poskanzer (jef@netcom.com) has given us permission to use his 
DOT crypto warning sign, if someone would like to incorporate that into 
thier idea. We will be finishing up our design over the next week, and 
working cost, sizes, etc. 

I'll keep you posted.
