Anyone out there have any experience with SafeBoot(tm) from SmartDisk  
Security Corporation?

Here's what you get in the mail when you call them for info:


[disclaimer:  I am not accociated with SmartDisk Security Corporation]

--------------

SafeBoot - The SmartDisk PC Security System

- SafeBoot is an extremely secure and easy-to-use access control system  
for the personal computer.

- SafeBoot is the first access control system to use the SmartDisk.  It is  
the only hardware-based PC security system that is suitable for all PC's  
including notebooks and portables.

- SafeBoot provides two factor access control; your PC cannot be used  
unless it is booted from your SmartDisk and your SmartDisk password is  
entered at the SafeBoot log-on screen.

- SafeBoot keeps your data confidential and protects your computer from  
unauthorized users.


EASY TO USE

SafeBoot is simple to install and easy to use.  During installation  
SafeBoot generates a unique encryption key, stores it one your SmartDisk  
and encrypts your PC's hard disk using this key.

The next time you want to use your PC, you simply boot your PC from your  
SmartDisk.  The SafeBoot log-on screen will appear and will prompt you to  
enter your SmartDisk password.  If you enter the correct password, your  
computer will start-up as normal.  You can then remove your SmartDisk and  
forget that SafeBoot is installed, as it will not interfere in any way  
with the normal operation of your computer.

SafeBoot will work with all disk utility tools and compression software,  
including Norton SpeedDisk and MicroSoft DoubleSpace.


DATA ENCRYPTION AND BOOT PROTECTION

When you boot your computer using your SmartDisk and enter your password,  
SafeBoot will read the encryption key held on the SmartDisk into the PC's  
memory.  SafeBoot will then transparently encrypt and decrypt all hard  
disk accesses until you switch off or reboot your PC.

Unlike most software-based PC security systems, that have to store the  
encryption key on the hard disk itself, SafeBoot uses the SmartDisk to  
store the key.  By doing this, SafeBoot prevents unauthorized users from  
using low level PC recovery tools to discover the key, and 'undo' the hard  
disk protection.


FULL OR PARTIAL HARD DISK ENCRYPTION

You can choose how much of your hard disk SafeBoot will encrypt.  For most  
purposes 'partial encryption' is more than adequate and is very quick to  
install.  'Partial encryption' encrypts the structure of the data on your  
hard disk - the information which MS-DOS uses to find the files and  
directories.

'Full encryption' takes a little longer to install, but will protect all  
of your data against even the most determined hacker.


BOOT SECTOR VIRUS DETECTION

Software-based virus protection products cannot prevent your computer from  
'catching' a boot sector virus.  Boot sector viruses can also be the most  
difficult type of PC virus to detect, as they are loaded into memory  
before any virus detection software can be run.  Once loaded, a virus can  
pretend that the boot sector has not been modified, thus prevent itself  
from being detected.

Because SafeBoot runs before the PC's boot sector is loaded it can detect  
boot sector viruses that otherwise hide themselves from virus detection  
software.


THE SMARTDISK

Although the SmartDisk looks like a 3.5" floppy disk and fits into a  
normal floppy disk drive, it is not a floppy disk.  It is actually a  
hardware device with its own microprocessor that provides secure, password  
protected storage.

The SmartDisk differs from all other hardware PC security solutions, for  
example, a smartcard, because it needs no special readers, extra circuit  
boards, or power supplies, and no connectors or cables.  The SmartDisk  
operates in a standard PC 3.5" diskette drive without modification to the  
drive or the PC.

SmartDisk directly enhances protection of the PC's data by retaining the  
encryption key, the password, and the encryption algorithm - none of which  
remains resident on the PC.  This ensures that the SafeBoot software is  
run before any other software is loaded on the PC, thus enabling SafeBoot  
to verify system integrity before continuing to load your PC's operating  
system.


LOST SMARTDISK OR FORGOTTEN PASSWORD

When SafeBoot is installed, it creates a backup of your encryption key on  
the SafeBoot system disk.  If you forget your password, of lose your  
SmartDisk, you can use this floppy disk to remove SafeBoot.


SECURING MULTIPLE PCs WITH ONE SMARTDISK

A single SmartDisk can be used to secure any number of PCs without  
incremental cost.  SafeBoot will generate a unique key for your SmartDisk  
the first time that SafeBoot is installed, but will allow you to use the  
same key for subsequent installations.


SAFEBOOT FOR CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTS

Various utilities are available to facilitate the installation and  
management of SmartDisks and SafeBoot encryption keys within large  
organizations.
