Especially in this season of good will, the idea that ``taxation'' and
``civility'' are somehow compatible cannot go unchallenged.  Above all,
``civility'' must mean that relations among people be by mutual consent,
or not at all.  Government is the institutionalization of exactly the
reverse: the imposition by the politically victorious upon all others,
the forceful supplanting of personal choice by collective dictate.  It's
the institutionalization of enmity.

Democratic political government, aka tyranny of the majority, will soon
succeed in inducing a new dark age on Earth, one that may never end.  An
individual who yearns to be free must overcome his mortality and leave
the Earth.  This will soon be practical.  Meanwhile, strong cryptography
and the cypherpunk agenda may provide a temporary defense.
