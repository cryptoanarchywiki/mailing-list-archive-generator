Nice, isn't it. And the S/N ratio has been much higher.

Depends on how fast the system running the remailer is. Key length
has little effect on encryption time, but a major effect on decryption
time. So if the machine is fast, use a 1024 bit key. If the machine
is slow or heavily loaded, and there is nothing going through it
that might interest a spook, use a 512 bit key.
