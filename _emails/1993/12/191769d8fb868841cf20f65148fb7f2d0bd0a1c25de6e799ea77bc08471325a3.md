The East German government did not "proceed rationally" and yet is no 
longer with us.

To what end.  We have had the Kiddie Porn Over the Nets story of the Day 
every day for the last six months in the US and the UK.  Have the nets 
been shut down?  With the clearance rate for *murders* in NYC falling down 
towards 30%, I doubt if we have much to worry about for our minor 
"crimes."

M >Go on, reassure me that "all is well".

All is as well as can be extected and much better than we used to fear.
