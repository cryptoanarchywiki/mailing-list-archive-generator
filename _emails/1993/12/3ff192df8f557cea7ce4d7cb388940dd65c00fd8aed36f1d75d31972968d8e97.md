Mr. Steingold is still being held; yet another modern American political 
prisoner. He's asked that all people, everywhere, supportive of freedom 
of speech and association please send him Christmas cards; he's hoping to 
get into the Guiness Book of World Records, and hence gain publicity 
which will make the evil sheriff set him free.

His address:

Craig Steingold
Inmate # 231768
c/o Washington County Jail
Coeur d'Alene, ID 97401





(Ok, ok, just kidding. Sorry. Couldn't help myself. Don't send cards. The 
bandwidth police can come get me now.)
