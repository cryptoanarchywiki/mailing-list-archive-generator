Interesting reading, but can you imagine how long it took him to type
it in? Five or six hours, easily. He didn't scan it, either. The typos
were the kind a human would make, not scanner errors.

There is something strange about LD's latest postings.
It appears whoever it is, is telnetting in from another machine
and feeding them into longs.lance.colostate.edu's smtp port. 
They are not doing a HELO before the message. Either he is being
spoofed, or his account is cancelled and he's posting from another
machine, or ?? any ideas?
