Normally, by a near-field receiver.  I don't know of any other way.

An AM band unit is about $110 and an FM band unit is $200-400.

I've seen ads for the AM band and I saw the FM unit at Hamvention in Dayton.

The AM band unit can detect FM transmissions, you just can't hear the
traffic, it's just quiet.  It was also advertised to be able to detect
leaking microwaves, etc.

If I understand it, nearfield receivers and frequency counters rely on
the relative strength surrounding a transmitter at close range to sync
with the frequency.  No tuning at all.
