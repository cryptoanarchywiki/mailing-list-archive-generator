Hi John,

    In addition I suggest still some more tools


     newsclip(by clarinet... provides for news clipping)

     newsfind(on soda.berkley.edu for searches of NNTP servers)

     agrep(Fuzzy set searches)

     expn(expanding mail aliases)

     addr-check(expanding and tracing mail aliases)

     netfind(email address searches)

     Xmosaic(hypertest gui... has some useful location features)

     whois(standard NS prog)

For tracing that mysterious person on the end of the line...

    cypherpunks may want to consider

     "How to investigate by computer"
      by Ralph D Thomas
      In-detail explanation of commercial access to xcross,
      criminal justice/public records/postal forwarding/
      credit info...

And the infamous
    
       "How to get everything on anybody"
        Vols 1 and 2 by Lee Lapin and Scott French

       "The Big Brother Game"
        same

       "Ninja 1990"
        same...
