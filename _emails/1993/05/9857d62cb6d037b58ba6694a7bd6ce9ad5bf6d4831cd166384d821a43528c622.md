Just so you know, gun control laws in Texas are about as strict as
those in Calif.  On the other hand, Louisiana has an "open-carry" law
(with exceptions for banks, bars, and a few other places).

I'm not sure if I felt safer in Louisiana or California.  I know that
we were a bit more polite in Louisiana, but then again, it was a more
rural state where *everybody* was poor, not just members of a couple
of ethnic groups.
