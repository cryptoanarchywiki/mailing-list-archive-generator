I'm not sure.  My understanding of SoundBlaster was that it could
produce sounds and had digitizing capabilities (ie. A/D D/A card)
If this is so it couldnt do any computations itself.  Somoene
mentioned Xyxel's modems will do CELP in and of themselves.

There is no doubt that the CPU can handle the encrypion +
framing, this is what I plan to do.

I am using the ADSP2105 from Analog Devices.  The list price
is about $12.  It has internal memory (1 kwords instruction,
512 words data,  24 and 16 bits wide respectively), and
boots instruction memory off of an eeprom.  Minimum setup
would probably be ADSP2105, xtal, eeprom (4k), max232 
(interface voltage levels), DAC/ADC chip and a power supply.

You can reach Analog Devices at (617) 329-4700,  they
send out spec sheets for free.
