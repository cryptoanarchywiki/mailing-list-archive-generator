Here in Florida, the information is supposed to be confidential.  Operation
Rescue (a group of fanatical Christians intent on harassing abortion clinics
and patients) has an employee in the DMV who snatches the number somehow,
however.  They now sit around in front of the clinics and jot down the
license numbers of patients and use their inside contact to find the name
and address of the patient and harass them.

ObRelation2Cypherpunks:  We are now trying to justify using the computer
privacy laws to prosecute specifically for the fact that the records are
being held electronically and Operation Rescue is illegally obtaining this
information and not going through proper channels.
