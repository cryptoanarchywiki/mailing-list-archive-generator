Actually, the most alarming revelation here could be that someone at uunet
is going around casually disclosing information about their customers.
Most communications companies, especially those that seek to be regarded
as "common carriers", make quite clear to their employees that customer data
are among their most proprietary and that revealing any of it is grounds for
lightning-speed dismissal.  (Obviously, they reveal data that they SELL about
their customers, and will disclose anything on a court order, but that's not
what we're talking about here).

communications companies)
