> The following, originating from Mr. Tom Justice (CGFS69A [Prodigy]) and
> authorized for resubmission to other networks, deals with proposed modem
> use fees. It was originally posted on Prodigy a couple of days ago. I would be
> interested in anyone's take on the accuracy of this. I apologize for its
> length but did not want to distort it too much through truncation.

>      "...Two years ago the FCC tried and (with your help and letters of
> protest) failed to institute regulations that would impose additional
> costs on modem users for data communication.
>      "Now they are at it again. A new regulation that the FCC is quietly
> working on will directly affect you as the user of a computer and modem.
> The FCC proposes that users of modems should pay extra charges for the use
> of the publc telephone network which carry their data. In addition
> computer network services would also be charged as much as $6.00 per hour
> per user for the use of the publc telephone network. Obviously these
> charges would be passed on to the consumer. The money is to be collected
> and given to the telephone company in an effort to raise funds lost to
> deregulation. Jim Eason of KGO newstalk radio San Francisco commented on
> the proposal during his afternoon radio program during which he said he
> learned of the new regulation in an article in the New York Times...."
> 
>      In a second post on Prodigy, Mr. Justice suggests writing to various
> regulatory officials to convey the following suggested text:
> 
> "Dear Sir:
>      "Please allow me to express my displeasure with the FCC proposal which
> would authorize a surcharge for the use of modems on the telephone
> network. This regulation is nothing less than an attempt to restrict free
> exchange of information among the growing number of comptuer users. Calls
> placed using modems require no special telephone equipment, and users of
> modems pay the phone company for use of the network in the form of a
> monthly bill.
>      "In short, a modem call is the same as a voice call and therefore
> should not be subject to any additional regulation...."
> 
>      Mr. Justice ends his second post with the following:
> 
>      "It is important that you act now. The bureaucrats already have it in
> their heads that modem users should subsidize the phone company and are
> now listening to public comment. Please stand up and make it clear that we
> will not stand for any government restriction on the free exchange of
> information.
>      "Pleae deal with this in a TIMELY manner. We can't wait and watch, or
> we will be walked over by government regulations that are trying to
> strangle us."
