Yes, this is worth pointing out; the main idea is to keep the 
opponent from knowing the format.  Increasing the entropy via
compressions is good in its own right since it makes the encoding
more complex and provides more stumbling blocks.

Cypher chaining seems to be even better for confounding opponents, 
but I'll let someone else commment on that.
