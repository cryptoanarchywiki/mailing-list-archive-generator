Digital Express doesn't require that the GECOS field of /etc/passwd contain  
real names, although they obviously allow it.  (Finger  
jthomas@access.digex.net for my full name, as well as my PGP key :^)

I seem to remember that the new user signup script they use explicitly gives  
you the option of signing up under a pseudonymn, although they'll check up on  
you by phone if you do (and presumably write your name in the Big Book at that  
point).  I've seen quite a few public access Unix sites advertising  
"anonymous" accounts lately, especially after Julf's server went down.
