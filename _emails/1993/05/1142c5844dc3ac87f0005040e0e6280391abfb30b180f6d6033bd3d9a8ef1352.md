Nothing is free. Food isn't free. Clothing isn't free. Places to live
aren't free. Computers to run crypto sofware are not free. There is no
reason on earth that privacy should be free.

This is not to say that privacy needs to be expensive. However, it is
to say that we do not yet live in a communist society. People DO
deserve to get rewarded for their work if they wish to be. Phil
Zimmerman and others have very kindly donated their work to the public
-- but we should not forget that they were in no way obligated to be
as nice as they were.
