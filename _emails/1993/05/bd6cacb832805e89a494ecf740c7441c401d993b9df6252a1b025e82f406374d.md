	 You missed it.  It has happened.  MIT used to run an alt.sex.bondage
	 stories server.  Someone would read a.s.b., cull out the stories and
	 make them available for anonymous ftp.

It's happening again, even as we speak.  The UNC public access system
is being criticized by the local Fox TV station for providing access to
``pornography'' to kids.
