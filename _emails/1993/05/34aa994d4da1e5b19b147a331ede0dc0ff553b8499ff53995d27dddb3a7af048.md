Subject: An end to the PGP quarrel?

The creator of PGP has proposed to Jim Bidzos of RSA that RSA approve
a new, already-written version of PGP which uses "RSAREF," an unprotected
version of the PGP algorithm. I propose that EFF-Austin write to Bidzos
endorsing the suggestion.

Hmm. Perhaps other groups might feel the same way, so this will be
copied appropriately.
