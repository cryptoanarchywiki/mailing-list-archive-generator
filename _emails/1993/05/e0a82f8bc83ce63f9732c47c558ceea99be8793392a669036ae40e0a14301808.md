Re: Much as I respect you Eric, I direct your attention to the myriad of
"checks" 
being sent out by AT&T and MCI, to name a few offenders. These bear the 
legend: "endorsement of this check constitutes your acceptance of <foo> as 
your long distance carrier."

When those go out in English to non-English speakers and get cashed, there
is a good case to be made for consumer fraud.  Anyone want to follow up on
that...?
