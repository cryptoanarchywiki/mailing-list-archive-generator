Hi ,  I was reading through some books at the library the other day
and came across this,  has anyone given any thought to implementing
this scheme?

   Matrix Extensions of the RSA Algorithm
   Chih-Chwen Chuang and James George Dunham
   CRYPTO '90 , page 140.

They suggest a matrix extension of the RSA algorithm which uses
much less computation time.  They go on to prove that the security
of the system is equivalent to RSA and the hash function used:
"Under a chosen plaintext attack on the key, the securityof the
new algorithm is equivalent to that of the RSA algorithm.  Under
a known plaintext attack on themessage, the security of the system
rests upon that of the one-way function."

Sounds like something worth looking into , as computation times
are *much* faster than that of normal RSA.
