On the other hand, perhaps the patent holder of LUC would be willing
to licence LUC for use in a PGP-like tool (or PGP 3.0) on the same basis 
IDEA is now licenced to PGP users. (i.e. non-commerical use is OK. Even 
certain commercial use is OK.)

This might solve a lot of our problems.

Has anybody asked? I can't be the first person to have considered
asking.
