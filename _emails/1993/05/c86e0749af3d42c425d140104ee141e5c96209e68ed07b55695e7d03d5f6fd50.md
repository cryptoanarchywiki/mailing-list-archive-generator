Hi All,
     With all this excitement about clipper, I am
questions about a number of points:

   * are we losing momentum on the anon-server front
   
   * we have just 13 remailers deployed... and from what I
     am given to understand insufficient traffic on all.

   * did penet II (with PGP inbound encryption similar to PAX)
     ever materialize?.(how about it Julf??)

   * what about John Gilmores suggestion for defensible
     U.S. Anon-sites.

   * 2 stage usage of anon-servers.

   * anonymous cash protocols and digital banks?

   * support of cypherpunks encrypted remailer blocks by aservers.

   * is anyone besides me working on supporting aliases for
     MH, the pgpedit script, and pgp 2.2's multiple recipient feature?

   * is anyone working on converting MajorDomo to support
     PGP encryption and PGP 2.2 multiple recipient feature
     and cypherpunk anonymous encrypted return address blocks.
     (I have already taken a pass at it and it didnt meet
      my design goals..i.e. runnable from a shell users
      .forward file, it requires sendmail.cf mods.)

   * anonymous posting/mail via open NNTP/SMTP servers and
     header social engineering.

   Email or reply to the list...

      cheers
      kelly
