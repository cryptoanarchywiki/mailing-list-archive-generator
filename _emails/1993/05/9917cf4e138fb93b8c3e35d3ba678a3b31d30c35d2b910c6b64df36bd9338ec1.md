Doesn't help much. >:)

I just want to know what it is about BBSing that scares the <insert fecal
matter here> out of the govt.  Why are porno, crypto, and <gasp> people saying
what the want to, somehow more threating on BBSs than about 10x as many people
doing the same thing on govt "controlled" <ha ha ha> educational systems?
If the govt really really sees these things as dangerous, would it not be wiser
to take care of the "cancer" in one's own body than worry about the health of
others?  Maybe the govt. is just totally irrational, or something.  Not saying
anyone should put a stop to alt.binaries.pictures.erotica, I could care less
if people like spending inorinate amounts of time uudecoding spotty nudie 
pics.  But the whole rationale behind attacking BBSs seems, like I said, ir-
rational...
