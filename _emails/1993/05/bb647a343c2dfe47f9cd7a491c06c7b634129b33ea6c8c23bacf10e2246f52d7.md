ABSTRACT

A signature scheme is proposed. It consists of two phases. The
first phase is performed off-line, before the message to be signed
is even known. The second on-line phase is performed once the message
to be signed is known. The scheme has a practical advantage as well as a
theoretical value.

It is shown that the on-line phase can be carried out very quickly,
by using a one-time signature scheme. The off-line phase can use a
simplified version of the square extraction method of Rabin. It
requires a moderate amount of computation, but can be performed
leisurely, before the message to be signed is even known. Thus, the
scheme may be of practical value in scenarios such as that of
electronic fund transfer.

It is proved that if the building blocks are secure against known
message attack, the scheme is secure against chosen message attack.


There will be tea at 10:45.
