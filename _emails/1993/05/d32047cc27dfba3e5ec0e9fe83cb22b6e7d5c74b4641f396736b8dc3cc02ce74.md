Caller ID in California: the question you need to ask is regarding ANI,
Automatic Number Identification.  That is available on 800-numbers and can
be delivered in realtime if you have enough traffic to justify a T1.  And of
course you can get it from any carrier you wish.  ANI is *not* Caller ID,
they work differently, use different signalling systems.
