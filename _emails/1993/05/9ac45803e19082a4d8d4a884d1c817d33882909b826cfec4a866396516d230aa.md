Possessors of all Knowledge Great and Small,
    I humbly beseech thy expertise on a manner in which I have none. I have 
been told that one can by an EEPROM programmer which fits on a card in the PC 
or a similar version which merley connects to the PC. I would like to know

   a) if this is so?
   b) how much they cost?
   c) where to find them?
   d) what their memory capacities are?
   e) do EEPROMS run as fast as regular PROMS?
   f) an other pertinent data.

Thank you very much!
