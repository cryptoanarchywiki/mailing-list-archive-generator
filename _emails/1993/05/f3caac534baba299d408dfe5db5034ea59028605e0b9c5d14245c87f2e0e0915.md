A month or so back, there appeared on this list a reference to a book on
the history of cryptology in telecommunications in the country. If memory
serves me (and it may well not) its title was something like "The Invisible
Weapon". Could some knowing person please send oe the full reference, or
otherwise unconfuse me?

Thanks!
