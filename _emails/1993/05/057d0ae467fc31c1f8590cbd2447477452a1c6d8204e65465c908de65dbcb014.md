Hi all.  I just received my demo version of Dolphin Encrypt which was 
shamelessly advertised on this list. ;^)  I haven't had much time to play with
it yet, but I thought I'd post my initial reactions.  BTW, I don't think I've
ever received anything in such a timely manner.  Good job guys.

The disk came with several pages of documentation, and advertising.  The docs
indicate that "the encryption process relies partly on the RSA Data Security,
Inc., MD5 Message Digest Algorithm."  I wonder what they mean by "partly."
Interestingly, a decrypt-only version is available.  Apparently, a C/C++ 
library of functions is available for $128 with commercial licensing offered.
The documentation indicates that the encryption key can be from 10 to 60 
characters in length, with case NOT SIGNIFICANT.

I ran the demo but didn't have time, at the moment, to really get into it, yet.
The demo indicated that the package supports a script language, which seemed to
be very powerfull.  In fact, part of the demo was writen with the scripting
language.  I think this is a novel idea.  The demo seemed fairly intuitive and
presented all (maybe too much?) of the needed information and status indicators.

This is the extent of my comments after a VERY superficial examination of the
software.  I will take a better look at it later this week.  If there is any
interest, I will write a more in depth review.

...just my $.02 worth.
