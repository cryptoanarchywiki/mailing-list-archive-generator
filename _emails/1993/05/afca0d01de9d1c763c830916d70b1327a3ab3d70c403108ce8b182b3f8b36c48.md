One of the main factors in crypto seems to be a source of random
numbers which most computers don't really have.

Wouldn't it be ppossible to apply the Mafia-numbers-game solution?
i.e. For your numbers (or seed for a large volume of numbers) take
a random pubically accessible number like the last 3 digits of the
attendance of a sporting event.
   
I have never seen any formalizations, but that type of number should be
as close to totally random as possible.
