Hi.  Can anyone answer a question about MacPGP?

My MaccPGP 2.2 seems to have developed a curious problem.

I'm using it on a Mac Classic with system software 6.07.

Both yesterday and today, I received a message from a friend,
encrypted with my public key. 

When I downloaded this message from my Unix account to my Mac, it
appeared on my screen as an MS Word icon.  (MS Word is the word processing
program I use.)

I launched MacPGP, and selected "Open/Decrypt" from the file menu, and 
up came the box with the list of files to choose from. 

I chose the just-downloaded message, and then, in the PGP message area, 
PGP gave me the following message:

	"File is encrypted. Secret key is required to read it. 
	This message can only be read by:

		keyID:  xxx

	You do not have the secret key needed to decrypt this file."

But the key ID number listed **is** in fact MY valid, working key ID !!
Would anyone have any suggestions about why this is happening?
Thanks, enormously, in advance.
