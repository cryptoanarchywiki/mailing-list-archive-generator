well i have the same problem because i am also on a pbx
system where you can call me by extension inside
or the 7 digit outside

but isnt/wasnt there a phone company number you could call
i forget what it was 631 4231 or something?
hell..

and besides.. 800 numbers get your phone number the 
same way your caller gets your number when you call collect
THEY ARE PAYING FOR THE CALL
they kinda have a right to know what they are paying for
