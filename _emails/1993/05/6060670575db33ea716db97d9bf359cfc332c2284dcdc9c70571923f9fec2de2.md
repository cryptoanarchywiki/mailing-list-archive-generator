	    This is a catalogue of NSA-tested security products for govt
	    agencies and contractors.  Think what you like of the
	    organization compiling the info, but this is the "real-world"
	    security stuff people; this covers just about everything
	    from secure satellite uplinks and tempest equipment to
	    encrypting modems.  Some of it is not available to the public,
	    but vendor contact numbers are provided, so with a little
	    hunting you might be able to find a nice list of the "high-end"
	    of the spectrum.

Source #2 : InfoSecurity Product News.  The trade rag of this business.
	    Can't remember the subscription info, but this seems to be
	    where the MIS types shop...
