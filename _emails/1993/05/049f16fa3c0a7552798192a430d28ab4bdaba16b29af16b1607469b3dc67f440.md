In fact, after reading some code, I noticed the optimisations are
in there, if one compiles with gcc (a few bytes of RS6k assembler
makes a significant difference!). Anyway, the particular benchmark
I'm playing with (key generation) is now about 20% faster with gmp
than with the routines provided with RIPEM.
