Greets, all...

I don't remember hearing this exact use of privacy-enhanced voice
communication discussed on the list before, but I might not have been
paying attention.  :-)

What do you think about encrypting voice communication in a
non-real-time sense?  Say I record a message (8-bit CODEC) on my NeXT
or on a friend's PC Soundblaster and then encrypt/scramble the file in
such a way that the resultant file is still audible.  I can then leave
that message on the recipient's answering machine or voice mail box
for him to later record and decrypt on his computer.  This method would 
make private voice communication more accessable, as it doesn't require 
real-time levels of performance.

Perhaps one of the PGP gurus could advise on how this sort of private
communications could be accomplished.  If PGP is used as the
encryption tool, then making the encrypted file audible is not unlike
making an encrypted file "readable" by turning it into mailable ASCII.

It is probably important to consider that recording an "audio armored"
encrypted voice message to an answering machine or voice mail box
will introduce various kinds of distortion.  Is anyone experienced with
error-correction methods for audio transmissions?
