who was the source of the anonymous Mykotronix postings. 

Through certain leads I have been able to find more info and will let 
cypherpunks know as soon as is feasible. Please don't ask how I am doing
it, I don't think I should reveal my sources.

If anyone feels the need to verify my postings, please go ahead and post
the results to this list.

thank you,
