It seems safer to assume that the software is insecure, until proven
otherwise. This is the approach that's been taken with the Clipper
chip, and seemed reasonable in that case - I suggest that it is in
this case, as well.

Rather, the original poster (Clark Reynard) seems to *not* have information
 - e.g., information about how or why the author(s) of this crypto package
are trustable, or why we should consider their software secure if we
can't look at the source.

If they are so naive as to think that the NSA can't afford a copy of
Sourcer and a few person-hours to disassemble VinCrypt, what other
(absurd) assumptions have they made? If a machine can execute it, a
machine (or a machine and a person) can disassemble it. I can't believe
that anyone's willing to take this VinCrypt crap even a little bit
seriously. Any dork with a laser printer can print up a press release
and mail it out - looks like maybe this was a slow week for the
computer press.

As far as I can tell, we're supposed to assume that VinCrypt is useful
software because of the political/social perspective of its authors.
While I share their suspicion of the powers that be, I do not trust them
to write software that is free of intentional and/or nonintentional
weaknesses.
