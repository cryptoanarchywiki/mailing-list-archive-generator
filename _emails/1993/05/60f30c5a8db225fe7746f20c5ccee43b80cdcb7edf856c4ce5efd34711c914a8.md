My apologies for not thinking to state what platform Dolphin Encrypt
currently runs on.  It's vanilla MS-DOS.  Other versions are planned.

The Dolphin Encryption Library (16 or so functions, containing the
core encryption functions from DE) is also for MS-DOS (designed to
work with the Microsoft and Borland development systems).  This is all
standard ANSI C code, so should port to other platforms without much
problem.  Currently there's a Clipper-oriented (that's the database
language) version in preparation.  Developers on other platforms
(Unix, Amiga, etc.) who are interested in porting the library should
send me email.  I am most interested in contacting someone who can
not only port the library but also market it.

Porting of the Dolphin Encrypt program is a Stage II task, and depends
on successful porting of the library.
