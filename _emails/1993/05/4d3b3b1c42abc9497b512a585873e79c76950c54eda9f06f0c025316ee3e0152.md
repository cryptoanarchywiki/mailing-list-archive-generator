You have indeed erred gravely :-)

One of the information theoretical concepts we are dealing with here
is that of information density.  The whole reason compression works is
that in most files, the information density is not "perfect"; that is,
there is repeated information in the file.  This reflects what we see
when we compress a file: the more which is repeated, the better
compression is.  Graphics compress much better than executeables.

Well, one of the reasons encryption works is because I can't tell from
the encrypted text what kind of patterns exist.  Consider a
letter-substitution cipher.  If I were to apply one to this message,
you could probably decrypt it, because much of the structure is still
there: common english words, letter frequencies, etc.  This makes
letter-substitution a pretty poor cipher.  What about DES?  Well, this
is interesting.  Without the key, the information density of an
encrypted file looks the same as the density of a compressed file, or
of noise.  This is why you could claim something was just noise, not
encrypted data.  It's also why a common "good" PRNG is formed by
feeding the numbers through some crypto algorithm, because it makes
the numbers appear random.

It is because encrypted data appears to have a very high information
density that it will not compress much, if at all.  Compressing
encrypted data, from some standpoints, is tatamount to actually
decrypting it.

Examples:

A is a file with 1000 lines of 79 "A"'s followed by a newline.
A.Z is the file, compressed.
A.x is the file, encrypted (unix crypt, lame, I know)
A.x.Z is the encrypted file, compressed wiht the -f option.

-rw-rw-r--  1 marc       106577 May 21 17:47 A.x.Z

Note that A.x doesn't compress at all.  In fact, it grows!
