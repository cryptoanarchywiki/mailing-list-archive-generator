I'm quite certain this post is a forgery.

Plenty of things seem wrong here.  For example, David doesn't
usually post through cs.utexas.edu (which is reportedly is one
of the least difficult sites to use for forging news articles).
Other things are also wrong with the header...

FLAME MODE:

In my opinion, posting this represents a disgusting violation of
net ethics (and the law).  It is frightening that someone could
be so immature as to attempt to damage David's relationships with
Jim Bidzos and others.

Hopefully someone can kill the article before it propigates
too far...

[I'm sending this to sci.crypt in addition to alt.privacy.clipper,
where a supposed "Public Apology" from David Sternlight was posted.]
