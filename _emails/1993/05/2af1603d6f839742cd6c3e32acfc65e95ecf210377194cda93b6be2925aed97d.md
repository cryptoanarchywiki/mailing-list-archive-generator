Well, gee. If I can avoid caller ID and 800 number ANI by simply using
any old cellular carrier for $0.40/minute (cheaper off peak), then why
should I pay $1.95/minute for the same service to 1-900-STOPPER?

Yeah, I know, that $1.95 probably includes the long distance portion too,
but I doubt there are any ordinary domestic calls that cost as much as
$1.55/minute...
