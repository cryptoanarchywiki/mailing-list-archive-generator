The biggest problem is CPU power.  The compression schemes that work
best are very computationally expensive.  Add to that the fact that
you need to do simultaneous encryption and compression, and if you
want full duplex make that simultaneous encryption, decryption,
compression and decompression.   You also have to send it over the
modem, and probably frame it too.

I'm currently implementing one scheme (LPC) on a DSP chip.  Hopefully
my end product will be <$50.  I plan put its own ADC/DAC chip on
board (to save computer<->DSP bandwidth).  Possibly some
high end CPU's like 486 and 040 could handle the load, but
wouldnt leave much cpu for anything else.
