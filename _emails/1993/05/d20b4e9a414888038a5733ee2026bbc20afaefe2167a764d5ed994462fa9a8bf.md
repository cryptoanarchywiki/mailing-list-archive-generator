Buzzword (acronym) of the day: VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier)
 
Where: UNIX Review
       May 1993
       Vol. 11, No. 5
       in "Devil's Advocate,"
       page 126,
       by Stan Kelly-Bootle
 
       "VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) is not MCI's view of AT&T,
        but rather one of those supertankers that regularly resort
        premature delivery, known as spillage."
 
My $.02: If it's not, it should be.
 
Cheers.
