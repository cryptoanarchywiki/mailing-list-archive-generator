I have a book titled "Data Compression" or something like that, which
explains Huffman and Huffman-type coding, arithmetic coding,
dictionary compressers (sliding window LZ* types), and JPEG
compression.  The book comes with source code, so if anybody else has
it and has a scanner...

As I recall, arithmetic compression works well, but is really cpu
intensive, even with a math-coprocessor.  Plus, you need to have a
rough idea of the statistical breakdown of the plaintext for
arithmetic compression to work as well as it can.  The Zimpel-Lev type
sliding window compressors are popular because they work well on most
inputs, with little or no pre-computation or statistics.

Isn't Phil Karn on this list?  I'm sure he can tell you everything you
want to know about compression :-)
