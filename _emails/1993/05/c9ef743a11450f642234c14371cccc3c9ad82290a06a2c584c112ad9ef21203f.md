	Hi, I don't think this subject is relevant to this list, but I was
flipping through the channels today and caught the last few minutes of 
the Markey Hearings on HDTV and digital broadcasting on C-Span. I wonder if 
anybody caught this and could e-mail me about it or posting it on this list.
(The outcome of it).

	-jas.

Does anybody know if it was broadcated on internet radio or the mbone?.
