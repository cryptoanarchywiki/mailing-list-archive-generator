I don't recall posting it to that newsgroup, but it doesn't surprise me
that it appeared there. I have strong connections with Austin and with
EFF-Austin.

ECPA doesn't mention encryption. It does, however, penalize unauthorized
disclosure of communications. Whether "disclosure" occurs when a
communication is seized, or when it's decrypted, is an open question.

Yes.

Lawsuits are almost inherently reactive. The best thing is to lobby
Congress for guarantees of the right to encrypt. State legislatures may
also be a useful target.

You have permission to repost it anywhere. I believe it appeared already
in cypherpunks, though. Maybe some people want to see it again.
