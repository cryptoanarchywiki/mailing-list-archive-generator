   it.  So sign with Working Assets and write them a note telling them you want
   to see a phonecard-only option soon, and chances are they'll be responsive
   if they get enough of those.  Especially if they're getting them from people
   who used to have accounts with teh Big Three.
				      ^^^ ^^^^^

Isn't Working Assets just a reseller of AT+T (or is it Sprint) LD?  As
such, you're still giving business to one of "the Big Three".
