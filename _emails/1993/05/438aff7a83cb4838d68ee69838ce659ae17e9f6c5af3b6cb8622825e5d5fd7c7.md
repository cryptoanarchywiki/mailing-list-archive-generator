All:
 
 ZENGER has been around for a long time. It is connected to a long
tradition and network. It will be part of the future. And it realizes
the importance of crypto-systems in any _real_ underground movement.
 
 When ZENGER has decided to come above ground for their latest publication,
the cypherpunks will be informed of distribution channels. Until then, keep
up the fight!
 
 More to come....
