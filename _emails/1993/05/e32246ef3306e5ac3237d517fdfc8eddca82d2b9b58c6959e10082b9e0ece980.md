well i dont know about boycotting AT&T
if you do, i would reccomend that you write a letter
to them telling them EXACTLY why you dropped their service
because boycotting someone without telling them that 
you are doing it is pointless

i like AT&T more than Sprint or MCI as companies
but then again i used to work for AT&T
so im kinda biased...

but i can guarentee that SPrint and MCI are more evil than AT&T

and using ANI was something i did as part of my life
its how i worked out billing,
although it DOES provide a means for finding out
your phone number whne you might not want it known
its main use is billing

and NO, most people dont know about it
so what do WE do to educate them?
