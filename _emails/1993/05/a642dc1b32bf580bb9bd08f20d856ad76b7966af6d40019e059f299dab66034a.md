(I've taken the liberty of renaming Hal Finney's thread, mainly since
I wasn't sure _what_ it was named...it arrived via the -request list
and was missing some headers....)

I think Hal is right, though the Clipper controversy has generated
a lot of new interest in crypto issues and perhaps even in this list.
My guess would be that many of today's readers are on this list now
because of the rude awakening Clipper gave them.

Having said this, I agree that our real strength lies in technical
areas (I'm referring to folks like Hal, Eric Hughes, Miron Cuperman,
all the others who're writing C and Perl code, and all those running
remailers and the like). The anti-Clipper work is related, but
probably isn't the core...fortunately, I doubt there's any conflict, as
people will work on what interests them, so the Clipper stuff probably
isn't affecting work on other core issues.

Maybe at the next Cypherpunks physical meeting we can get some idea of
what others are doing? For example, perhaps Hal Finney could
communicate by phone for a few minutes? (We did this with the Boston
and D.C. Cypherpunks at the emergency Clipper meeting and it worked
well.)

Others could also call in, or vice versa.

Things like digital money will require a lot of effort, probably two
or three times what PGP took (just a guess). Wide deployment is even
more problematic. These are "social" issues, not just technical
issues, of course, so progress is hard to predict.

It may take a while.
