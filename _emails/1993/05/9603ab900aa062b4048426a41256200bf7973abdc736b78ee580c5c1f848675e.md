 I beg your pardon, but this is _not_ the case. TEMPEST requirements
 are _not_ classified and are available for public scrutiny. (You
 obviously do not know where to look.) I _know_ this to be true: I
 working in the COMSEC arena within the US military for the better
 part of five years. In fact, I helped design and construct the first
 tactically-based, X.25 packet switched, PC based, uHF interfaced
 network in Europe back in the early '80's using  Zenith Z-248's and
 KG-84's. We did everything from designing the cabling pin-out's on
 up.

 You're trying to separate issues that are one and the same. With the
 proper equipment, I can put you and an IBM Selectric (tm) typewriter
 on a wooden raft in the middle of Lake Superior, monitor and realize
 every keystroke that you make and you'd not be the wiser. This type
 of monitoring is easily defeated by low yield TEMPEST requirements.
 I've worked in this area, Bill, and have tested these _facts_. I
 don't care how you care to word it, it _is_ transient
 electromagnetic emissions.

 As I stated above (and I place myself in jeopardy of being accosted
 by Big Brother by admitting it), I was a COMSEC flunky during my
 junket with the US Army. Originally, I was a 31S(ierra) and later a
 29S(ierra) when two MOS's (Military Occupational Specialties, in Army
 jargon) were later merged. I was also a COMSEC Custodian (alternate,
 actually) and I can admit that I have a deep understanding of
 cryptographic key systems, cryptographic theory, cryptographic
 hardware design and integration and "BLACK" and "RED" separation
 principles. This type of technology does not require a rocket
 scientist (trust me, I've worked with them too at NASA)(oh yeah, I
 forgot -- I've also done contract work for Bell Labs and AT&T Secure
 Systems).

 This issue is one where I must disagree with you emphatically. The
 majority of the American public don't even know about Clipper. Hell,
 most of them think those AT&T commercials (Aretha singing "Freedom")
 are cute. Personally, I think its pretty sick, considering how they
 worked in collusion with Big Brother (No Such Agency) and announce
 that they would be immediately using this "technology" on the same
 day that the NIST made its announcement that Clipper would be the
 "weapon of choice" in their war on drugs, would-be criminals and the
 American public (April 16, 1993).
 
 I know the technical specifics of TEMPEST (it is an acronym, BTW) and
 the reason it was developed as a SIGINT (SIGnal INTelligence) standard.
 
 Cheers.
