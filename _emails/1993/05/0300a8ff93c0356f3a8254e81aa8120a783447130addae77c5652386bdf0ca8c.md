Hi.

Being the security freak that I am, even with military grade encryption (for
whatever THATS worth) I feel a little insecure, as most routines are, as far
as I can tell, still succeptable to at the least brute force attacks. I was
wondering: how to cracking programs determine that they have successfully
decrypted a file? Does it simply look for english text (or file headers etc)?
If so, how about double-encrypting a file with two completely different and
very complex programs? Then, even if it did get the first, it couldn't tell
because the resulting data would still be largely gobbledegook.

Probably a stupid question, but I was curious.
