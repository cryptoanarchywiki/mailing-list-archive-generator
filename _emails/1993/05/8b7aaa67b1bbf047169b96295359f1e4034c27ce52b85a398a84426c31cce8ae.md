As one of the former tech-weenies at Express Access, and now just a friend 
with no formal association to the business, I feel compelled to give you my 
thoughts on that particular service provider. 

Rarely will you find a system administration staff more concerned with your 
privacy that the guys at Digital Express Group. As I recall, the set of 
username->real name mappings isn't even on machine readable media on the 
system. When I was working with them, we had a big book, and people only 
accessed the book when absolutely necessary, for instance to inform a user of 
a file system problem or the like. 

In fact, on several instances, I would ask other staff people who a 
particular username belonged to when I had a need to contact them - more 
often than not, they/we couldn't remember, and I had to look it up anyway. 
This was by design. 

From day one, there was a policy of not disclosing customer information to 
ANYONE without a warrant. To date, thankfully, I don't think that it's been 
put to the test, though I have no doubts as to the grief they'll give those 
trying to get the information. 

The original machine room was one of the best jobs of low-cost RFI/EMI 
shielding construction I've ever seen. (BTW, the foam insulation with foil on 
both sides is a boon to mankind.) It wasn't really intended to keep people 
from looking at the emissions as to keep the emissions from wiping out all 
the shortwave receivers in use, but hey, every little bit helps.

I'm still a user there, and I have a hell of a lot of respect for that crew. 
I would also implicitly trust them as a site for anonymous remailing, key 
certification, or the like. I hope that becomes a part of their business 
focus in the future, because we need service providers who won't be 
intimidated.
