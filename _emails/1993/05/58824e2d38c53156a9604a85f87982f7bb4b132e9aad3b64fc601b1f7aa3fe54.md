Thanks for the good thoughts, Pat. Anyone who wants the details of my
own little disaster down here should send me e-mail--offers of help
are appreciated.

One request this list could help me with: Does anyone know how I can
find a hardbound copy of Kahn's THE CODEBREAKERS. I didn't own a copy
before the fire, but I had started my crypto collection, and I'll be
continuing to work on it.
