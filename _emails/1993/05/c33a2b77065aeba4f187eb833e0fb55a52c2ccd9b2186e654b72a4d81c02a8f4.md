Since I haven't seen any mention of this yet:

On the D1 (business section) page, in the top center, in today's [May
6] New York Times, is a diagram and 38" story on issues re: Clipper.

Given that it's a finals week, I don't have time to enter much from
the article, but will note the following:

The first two paragraphs:

	Can the nation trust its secrets to its spies?
	That question underpins a fierce debate over a recently
disclosed plan by the Clinton Administration to secure the privacy of
the nation's phone calls and computer data with a standard set of
computer codes.

The first quotation (and the only one appearing on D1) in the article
is from Eric Hughes:

	"This plan creates the ears of Big Brother, just as Orwell
warned," said Eric Hughes, an independent software designer in
Berkeley, Calif.

...

	- Lee
