Some mightsay that outlawing all unsupervised communication and activities by
its citizens is-and always will be-a goal of all governments.

Protection from authoritarian eyes is one of the main causes for the ever
increasing use of crypto. Government issued crypto can never satisfy the
peoples desire to find a means that guarantees secure communications.

If the government wants its Clipper scheme to succeed, the government will
have to dramatically limit the availability of good crypto. One of the more
obious methods to accomplish this is to outlaw non-government approved
crypto.
