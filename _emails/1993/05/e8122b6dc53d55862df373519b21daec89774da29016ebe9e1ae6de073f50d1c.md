I'm curious as to what good this will be then.

The distributed nature of a usenet group would be nice....

Without controversial postings, no one will read the group.  What is the point,
then?

Some time ago, I joined the bandwagon in opposing this "hasty" decision to
form the WB group.  But, I like this idea.  My reason for opposing it the first
time was that people's lives/jobs could be at stake.  This might be a 
germination point for the full-blown WB group, but without the risks to it's
contributers.  I like this idea.

I'm reading it.  And (for once?) I agree on this subject.

I know the feeling..... ;^)
