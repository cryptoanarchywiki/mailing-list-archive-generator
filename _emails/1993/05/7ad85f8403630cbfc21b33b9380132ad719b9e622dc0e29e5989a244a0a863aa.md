This is a bit off topic, please excuse the list bandwidth...

Today's (5/26/93) Washington Post has a story on page 1 of the Style section
about net-lawyer and occasional cypherpunk poster Mike Godwin
(mneumonic@eff.org). Seems that Mike just moved from Cambridge to Washington
DC, and the moving truck that had all his stuff caught fire and burned.
He lost "90%" of his stuff, books, clothes, records, family photos, etc.
Serious bummer.

The article says that he went onto the WELL and the electronic community
offered to help replace some of his books, etc. A word or two from our
community might help raise his spirits.
