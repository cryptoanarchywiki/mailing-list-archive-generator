: To whoever it was at Ohio who just fingered this account... (whether it's

What a nosey bunch...  I've had this machine on the net for almost a year
and not been fingered by as many strangers as over the last three days.  Anyway,
here's a little experiment in paranoia...  which of these people *aren't*
cypherpunks...?  I've always wondered if joining a list like this would
bring unwelcome attention...  I've marked the people who I know are on
the cypherpunks list with a *.  If any of the rest of them are 'one of
us', let me know.  By elimination we'll work out where the gummint spies
hide out :) ... (The machines that reject finger requests and telnet VRFYs
are pretty suspicious...)  And I'm also particularly suspicious of the
finger from ohio-state - it *was* someone who reads this list (the svp ID
was created especially for it) but there are *no* ohio-state sites in
the mailing list at all.

If this is considered a waste of the list's bandwidth, flame me privately...
In fact, reply privately whatever you have to say... (gtoal@gtoal.com)

PS Someone mailed me to ask how I knew if I'd been fingered - it's a combination
of a home-hacked fingerd and the log_tcp wrapper package.
