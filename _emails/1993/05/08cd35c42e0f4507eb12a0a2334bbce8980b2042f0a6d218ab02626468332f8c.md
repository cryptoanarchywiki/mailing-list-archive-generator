I am getting involved in networking some local BBS' and message bases.
One of the primary functions of this network will be to serve as a 
library for PGP keys and to use PGP in sending messages. 
  
Now, if people read their messages offline, is there any offline
readers that exist that integrate PGP (all this is IBM based) or
is there an easy way to do this. Ideally, I want to avoid having to
decrypt each message individually and would like PGP interfaced so 
that it could recognize a message header, apply th eright key, and
output in the reader. I am probablky asking for too much.
   
Does anyone have any experience/advice w/ this tpye of large scale
implementation of PGP? I know the need to encrypt most of the messages
will be small, but I think it is important to get these people so
familar w/ encryption, they won't be scared and will defend it when
the need arises.
