Okay, folks. Let's bring this into focus.
 
I don't like unfounded allegations, especially when they are involving
my own communications providers, but let's let the truth be known. I'd
like to summarize to the list several trains of thought and track this
down to a reliable source. If, in fact, a UUNet operator/provider has,
indeed, stated that this has been common practice, I think that it may
behoove them to own-up to these allegations. Before I do confront the
UUNet staff, however, I must get the allegations correct, and I
therefore rely on you crypto-rebels to provide them for me. Please.

  Is this hearsay, innuendo or fact? If fact, what can you site as
  reference to support your statement? If you know this to be fact,
  please cite your references and provide as much detail as possible.
 
  Cheers.

additional affidavits, if necessary. If you do not care to get
involved, fine. If you care, please re-affirm.)

I would like. Specifically, an e-mail address other than "postmaster."
 
The point is this, Marc: Those of us who subscribe to UUNet through
third party services have no idea that our communications may be
recorded or archived for intelligence purposes (I know, but that's
beside the point). If UUNet _is_ doing this without a broad policy
statement, then I think a change is in order.
 
Also, (and I do not implicitly imply that UUNet is responsible), I've
had some very interesting problems passing encrypted traffic. For some
strange reason, it just disappears. Fancy that. Should I question
that? You bet. And I shall. I, and my comm provider, pays in good
faith for our Internet services. We are protected under Law, and as
far I know, UUNet does not expressly forbid encrypted _private_
communications. But, it happens. They just disappear sometimes. Go
figure.

I beg your pardon. Since when does stupidity become a prerequisite for
privacy rights violations? I'm not talking about Usenet or List posts,
Marc, but private e-mail.

Of course it is. This is not an issue.

Thank you for your insights. I will ask UUNet, but I'm beginning to
wonder if other local comm providers practice the same deceptions.
Does anyone have any experiences with digex.com that they would like
to share?
 
If so, it would aid in our attempts to bring these unknown anomalies
to light. I don't like spending money to have my private e-mail
compromised.

Actually, I find this possibility both extremely disturbing, yet
possible. I don't wish that this what we will find out; I hope that
legal inquiries will not be necessary. However, if information
concerning these topics is not divulged voluntarily, then we must take
legal action to bring this to the surface.

Indeed, we are not speaking of the dissemination of USENet or List
information, but rather private e-mail.

I'd have to be presented with factual documentation to actually
believe that.

Funny how that works, huh? The dumpster divers band together when t
comes to stuff like that, from what I'm told.
