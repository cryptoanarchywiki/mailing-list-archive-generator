I think the forgery was kind of primitive and obvious (OK, I admit I did
get a little chuckle out of it).  But if it wasn't already clear to everyone
that it was a fake, I'm sure Sternlight's and your responses made it clear.

I'm strongly opposed to being cops and "tracking down the culprit."  It was
just an innocent joke, and no one was hurt.  If Sternlight's ego was bruised,
then (as my mom used to say) "my heart bleeds for him."  It's not a big deal.
We've got better things to do than help David Sternlight fight his battles
(though I agree it's useful to have him around).
