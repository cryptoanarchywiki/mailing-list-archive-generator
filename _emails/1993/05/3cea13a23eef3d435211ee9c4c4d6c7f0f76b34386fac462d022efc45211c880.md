Hiya guys!
	Does anybody know of or read the book Talking Chips by Nelson Morgan
(Mcgraw-Hill). It's supposed to mention something about DSP chips. Can some
one tell me something about the book or recommend a reference manual or
something close to a ref. man. related to DSP(I need to look up some specs)
