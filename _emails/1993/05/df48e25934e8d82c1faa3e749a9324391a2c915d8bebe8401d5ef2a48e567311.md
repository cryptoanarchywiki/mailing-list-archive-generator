This is absolutely untrue of Oregon - at least in the Willamette Valley.
I see fewer guns (and gun-racks in pickup trucks) here than I did when I
lived in Southern California.

It is difficult for me to express how uninterested I am in the prospect
of debating gun control here in cypherpunks. I will compromise with
"very, very, uninterested."
