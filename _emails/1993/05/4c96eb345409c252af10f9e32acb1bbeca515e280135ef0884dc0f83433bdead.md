I think this is another map/territory confusion.  The RIGHT and the defense,
use, tools for, effect of, etc. of the right are not the same thing.  It is
like the distinction between philosophy and books about phil.  The first is
free.  The second cost money as does instruction in philosophy, etc. Even
the effects of philosophy can be costly.  But the concept "philosophy" has
no price tag.

In addition to what I already said, I agree with this absolutely 100%.

Most astute.  I agree with this also.  That was one of the reasons I "put
my money where my mouth was" and tried to dist. PGP on my BBS.
