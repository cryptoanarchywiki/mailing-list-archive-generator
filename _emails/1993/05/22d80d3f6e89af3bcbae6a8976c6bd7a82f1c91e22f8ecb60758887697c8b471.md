Can someone tell me whether what I've heard about GCHQ in the UK??

A lot of books and magazines of fairly serious political content have alleged
that GCHQ taps _all_ Irish telephone calls and screens them electronically for
"keywords", to find the interesting conversations.
(The IRA is alleged to have something similar, although not quite so 
sophisticated)

What I want to know is whether digital voice-recognition monitoring on such a
scale is really possible?

Thanx in advance

Antoin O Lachtnain,
Trinity College Dublin.

PS Iis there anyone in the UK or Ireland who'd be willing to send me a copy of 
PGP 2.2, if I send them a couple o' blank disks?
