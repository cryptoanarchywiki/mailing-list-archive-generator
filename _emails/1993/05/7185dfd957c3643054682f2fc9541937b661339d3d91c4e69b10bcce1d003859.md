	 Thanks for the good thoughts, Pat. Anyone who wants the details of my
	 own little disaster down here should send me e-mail--offers of help
	 are appreciated.

	 One request this list could help me with: Does anyone know how I can
	 find a hardbound copy of Kahn's THE CODEBREAKERS. I didn't own a copy
	 before the fire, but I had started my crypto collection, and I'll be
	 continuing to work on it.

It's still in print:
