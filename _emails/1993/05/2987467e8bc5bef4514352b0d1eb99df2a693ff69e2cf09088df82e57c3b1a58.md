I'm working on one myself.  I'm testing it now; its still kinda alpha at the
moment.

Not at all.  My system is currently geared toward UNIX, but can be modified
to work with anything. ;^)  Right now, I have to select the mail by hand, but
the software xfers it and indexes it automaticly.  Then I can select read and
I get a menu of my messages to be read....index, sender, and subject.  I have
delete working.  Also, I have send working quite well.  You select Create to
create a message.  You then have a choice of editor.  After you create a file,
you have the option of calling the encryption menu to encrypt/sign it.  Then
you select send.  You give the program the name of the file, who it goes to, and
a subject.  I have a script which dials the system, and uploads the mail  with-
out me being there.

The benefits are that the plaintext never spends time on the mainframe, and you
control the keys.

I have a few features to add.  I want to add multiple-hosts capability, aliases,
and automatic encryption. 

I'm writing this sytem in 4dos batch language and telix communication scripts.
I'm doing it this way because it's a great developement language with lots of
high-lever tools.  I'm quite prowd of how it's working.  I'm also thinking of
porting it to C.

I agree totally!  This is important.
