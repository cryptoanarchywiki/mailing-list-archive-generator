 Before I say anything further, let me clarify that I am making no
 specific allegations directed towards anyone. There have just been
 some questionable occurrences of late that are very weird (read:
 spooky) which I find little reason to dismiss as coincidental.
 Vanishing e-mail (both coming and going), duplicate list posts with
 odd originator headers and routing info.
 
 As  I said before, I'd just like a few things explained and put into
 their perspective context.
