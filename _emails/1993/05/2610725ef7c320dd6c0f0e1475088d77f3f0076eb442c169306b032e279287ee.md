What is YTalk?
==============

YTalk is a multi-user drop-in replacement for the UNIX "talk" program.
I have added encryption facilities to it, including private key and
PGP authentication.

Features
========

- Multi user capabilities.
- Drop in replacement for /usr/ucb/talk.
- Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange for session keys.
- IDEA encryption in CFB mode.
- Password authentication.
- PGP authentication.
- Logging of conversations to a file.

Known bugs and misfeatures
==========================

- No security the first time you use it, until the random seed file
  is created (around 300 keystrokes).
- Some problems with the talk daemons on Ultrix and SCO-Unix.
- Port to Alpha (64bit) incomplete.

Availability
============

Version 2.1
Ftp:	soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks/applications

Bug reporting
=============

All bugs to miron@extropia.wimsey.com.
