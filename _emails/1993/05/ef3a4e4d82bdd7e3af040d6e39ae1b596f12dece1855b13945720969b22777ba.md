Government Communications HQ or something like that.  It is similar to
the NSA.  Rumor has it that each agency taps the other's domestic
calls, so both may truthfully say that they don't engage in domestic
survellience... 

I beleive the U.K. still denies the existence of the GCHQ, despite
there being a large building with satellite dishes and antennas all
over it in Cheltenham (?).  I read that a government minister said in
response to a statement made by a former GCHQ chief that he worked
at the "GCHQ" that this didn't necessarily mean that GCHQ existed
before his tenure, nor does it imply the GCHQ existed after he left...
(This from the book _SpyCatcher_?)
