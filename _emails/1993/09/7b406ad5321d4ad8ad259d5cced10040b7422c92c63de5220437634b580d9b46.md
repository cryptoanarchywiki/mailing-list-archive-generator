Yeah, I agree the tax is stupid, and I would certainly hope that some of the
affected parties get together and start some kind of lawsuit on the basis of
the discriminatory preference for paper media... 

...but for God's sake, let's not sink to the level of calling for the
assassination of elected officials... aside from the obvious legal issues,
that puts us on *their* level.
