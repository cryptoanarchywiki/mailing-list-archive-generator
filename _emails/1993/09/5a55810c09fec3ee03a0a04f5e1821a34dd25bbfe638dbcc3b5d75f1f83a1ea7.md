I have been studying the US constitution lately, and an excerpt from
Article 1 Section 10 seems appropriate:

  No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or
Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary
for executing its inspection Laws; and the net Produce of all Duties and
Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use
of the Treasury of the Unites States; and all such Laws shall be subject
to the Revision and Control of the Congress.

In liberty,

Peter Baumbach
