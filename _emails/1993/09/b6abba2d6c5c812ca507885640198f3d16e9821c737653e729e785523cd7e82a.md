Cypherpunks:
      I now have David Colston's [5542837@mcimail.com] source
      code for "CALL SECURITY".  I also have the IBM PC executables.

CALL SECURITY is an implementation of David's QPK (quick public key) algorithm.
If you are on BIX I can E-mail to you with binary attachments,
please specify which files.  I am not sure how to get this to an FTP,
BIX doesn't have FTP posting yet. I know it is done from BIX, help is welcome. 

  So, I will make this software available on my PC this *WEEKEND ONLY*

      The purpose is to S P R E A D this stuff around.  Please
      upload to an FTP, BBS or what-have-you.

      SEC_SRC.EXE 64668 bytes self extracting source code
      SEC_RUN.EXE 278542 bytes self extracting RUN TIME EXECUTABLES (PC) 
      2400 baud only  8n1 zmodem, ymodem, xmodem
      You will connect with Telix "qdhost" script.
      Enter full name (chrs (space) chrs)  please be truthful
      Password is   QPK   (in caps)
      Phone (501) 839-8579
      Voice (501) 839-3543
      I do not run a BBS, forget these numbers after this week end
      United States calls only,  honor system, please.

      email charliemerritt@bix.com
