Cpunks:
	We've been kicking around the pros and cons of anonymous remailers
here at io.com. One of the big problems is anonymous bombardment of a 
helpless newsgroup. This (and the problem of auto-screening anonymous
mail) could be solved if there was a standard header keyword (or maybe 
even a new header field) that could be screened from a newsgroup. The
group would have to be semi-moderated -- an automatic filter passes on
all posts except those with the keyword in the appropriate header field.

	If anonymous posts aren't annoying enough to instigate the 
creation of such a filtered newsgroup, then they probably aren't enough
of a problem in that group to worry about.

	Words such as "anon" and "anonymous" might occur naturally in
the headers. I'd propose something like "ANONYPOST" or "ANONPOST" that 
isn't likely to occur in nature.

	Voluntary adoption of this type of standard by remailers would
take away some of the ammo that the anti-anon frothers are shooting,
and would go a long way toward improving the image of remailers in 
general.

	Comments?
	Loyd
