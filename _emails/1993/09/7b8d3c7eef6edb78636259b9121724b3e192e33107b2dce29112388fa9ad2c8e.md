My "social studies" teacher from 7 - 9th grade, Mr. Codianni made sure we knew
this! (This was around 1968/69 so the System was being stress on all ends)
We had a textbook for american history that was made up completely of primary
and secondary sources.  It was obvious to me early on that the main reasons
for the american revolution were economic as opposed to some overwhelming
altruism. All of the founding fathers had a lot at stake but would also
make a bundle if they could just get rid of that middleman (King George III)
