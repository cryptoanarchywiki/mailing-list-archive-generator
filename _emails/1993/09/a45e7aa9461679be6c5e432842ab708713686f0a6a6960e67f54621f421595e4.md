Compared to the recent news of subpoenas, the following is pretty mild
stuff, but nonetheless it may be of some value:

An AT&T companywide newsletter sent to 300,000 employees, contained a
cartoon showing people all over the world talking together on the phone.  In
every continent there was a picture of a human, except for the continent of
Africa, where a **monkey** was pictured.  Upon having the obvious racist
significance of this pointed out, AT&T issued an apology.  

Okay, anyone who can come up with a copy of this thing, email me:
gg@well.sf.ca.us.

LEt's get it into circulation; it will help make things hot for the company
which sells Phones With Big Brother Inside.  


Hey, re these subpoenas: time for an emergency meeting to discuss legal
strategies, publicity strategies, and all that stuff, yes?  How about
Sunday?
