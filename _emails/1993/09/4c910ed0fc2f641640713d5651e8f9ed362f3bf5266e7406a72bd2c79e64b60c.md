Here is an interim release of the list, which includes the elee9sf@menudo
and elee6ue@rosebud remailer.  (And you thought I was joking when I said
that some people run remailers that aren't announced :-)

I cleaned up the scripts at elee6ue@rosebud, and in the process of creating
the proper directories for caching (which is NOT implemented just yet) I
zapped the pgp directory and the keyrings... so now there is a new key
for elee6ue@rosebud.ee.uh.edu, keyid = BBC00D.  Sorry about that!

Also, my key klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu, keyid = 5AD633 has an A.K.A. on
it for elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu.  This is NOT the public key to the remailer,
whose keyid is DC9EE9.

I sign the public keys of remailers I have verified as working, so if you
get the latest pubkeys.tar.gz file from soda or the keys from me, you
will find a signature from 5AD633 on them.

Lastly, thanks to folks who are contributing programs to help other use
the remailers!  I decided to keep my offerings as shell scripts or batch
files, but there is only so much these languages can do, so I welcome
"high" level help programs (source included :-).  Nate's program is
mentioned, but not Alex's (yet) since it isn't available via ftp (yet).
I'll try to keep on top of this stuff.

Q2: What help is available?

A2:

Check out the pub/cypherpunks/remailer directory at soda.berkeley.edu
(128.32.149.19).  

chain.zip             - program that helps with using remailers
dosbat.zip            - MSDOS batch files that help with using remailers
hal's.instructions.gz - in depth instruction on how to use
hal's.remailer.gz     - remailer code
pubkeys.tar.gz        - public keys of remailers which support encryption
pubkeys.zip           - MSDOS zip file of public keys
scripts.tar.gz        - scripts that help with using remailers

Also, at 129.82.156.104 in /pub/pgpc/ are two files: pgp22.tar.gz,
pgp22.tar.Z which assist in using the anonymous remailers, including
anon.penet.fi.

Mail to me (klbarrus@owlnet.rice.edu) for further help and/or questions.

======================================================================

Q3.  Email-to-Usenet gateways?

A3.

 1: group-name@cs.utexas.edu
 2: group.name.usenet@decwrl.dec.com
 3: group.name@news.demon.co.uk
 4: group.name@news.cs.indiana.edu
 5: group-name@pws.bull.com
 6: group-name@ucbvax.berkeley.edu

NOTES:

*  This does not include ones that work for single groups, like twwells.com.
#1 apparently blocks anonymous remailer posts
#6 blocks from non-berkeley sites (so use the berkeley remailers :-)
