I was under the impression that mjr's suggestion was to use the randseed
the same way it's being used now, only to store it encrypted instead of clear.
This has some advantages - stealing it is now much less useful.

On the other hand, it means you need to use your secret key when
encrypting files, as well as when decrypting or signing them,
which increases the exposure of your secret key as well as being annoying.

If the IDEA key is generated by a one-way function such as MD5,
it's ostensibly 2**128 work to duplicate an MD-5 hash, and
potentially 2**400-2**500 work to generate the input to the hash
(which is essentially impossible, since the input:hash is N:1, not 1:1.)
Of course, it's still easy to implement wrong, leading to lossage :-)
But even something as simple-minded as
	sessionkey  = MD5(randseed+constant)
	newrandseed = MD5(randseed+differentconstant)
would be pretty secure (and the real thing also includes timestamp and 
MD5 of the message, further randomizing it; haven't looked at the randseed code.)
