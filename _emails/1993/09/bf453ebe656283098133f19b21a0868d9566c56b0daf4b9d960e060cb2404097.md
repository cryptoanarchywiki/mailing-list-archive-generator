In the current context, the best reference that I know of is to
the methodology of Goedel's Theorem rather than to ZPT; it has each
of the properties that I mentioned except for the ZPT operations,
which can be added in a conceptually straightforward way. The most
readable in depth treatment of that that I know of is "Goedel's Proof"
by Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman, c. 1958 and still in print as
a cheap paperback.

If someone has good ZPT references that would be interesting too; I've
lost the stuff I used to have on that.
