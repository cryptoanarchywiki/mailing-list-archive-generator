Well, we'd like crypto for the masses and I don't think that the masses are
yet ready to put out the bucks for spread spectrum boards and infrared laser
communications gear...  It'd be really nice to have such a decentralized
network, though.

This would be the perfect network in which to deploy DC nets....  (dining
