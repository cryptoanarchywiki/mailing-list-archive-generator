Just what we need -- a whole new field day for the disconsolate Kennedy
conspiracy theorist industry! Maybe they'll let us see *these*
documents in 2050 or so!

(Disclaimer: of course, this has only tangential relevance to the list,
but it has formed one of the hottest, most recurring, and emotional
topics on the list, and hopefully everyone who would flame me for
posting it here has already deleted the message based on the subject
line! so NYAAHH!)

By Richard Ginn <rlg1@cornell.edu>, Ithaca, New York, USA - 9 Sept. 1993 - 

The United States Justice Department has requested that all files relating
to the Waco, Texas [Branch Davidian - David Koresh and friends] raid by
U.S. Government forces and the resulting deaths be exempted from all
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiries and that the files be sealed
so that no one may make any further inquiries into the Waco incident.

The full text of the request can be found in the United States Federal
Register, Volume 58, Number 156, on Monday August 16, 1993, page 43312. 
The period for comment on this action expires on September 15, 1993 (six
days from the date of this message), after which the files will be sealed
if there is no opposing comment by the public.
