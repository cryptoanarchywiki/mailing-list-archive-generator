Responding to H. Finney's probing, sterling, and brilliant analysis of
ITAR (which I was utterly embarrassed to see buried and sandwiched in
sordid flames) J. Bidzos claims that ``The ITAR specifically exempts
software from being considered public domain'' and points out that the
PKP FTP site in question that H. refers to as `causing a big stink' was
*non-anonymous*.

I would like to see J. Bidzos' sci.crypt posting reposted here *ASAP*
by some bored cypherpunk who would like to ``contribute''! Major
cyberspace points await!
