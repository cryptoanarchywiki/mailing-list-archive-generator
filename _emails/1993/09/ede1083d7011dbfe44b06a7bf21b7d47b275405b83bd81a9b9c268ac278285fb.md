The latest "EFFector Online," available in the usual places, is
oriented toward crypto, having a lengthy summary of the
Skipjack/Capstone issue (more legalese about escrow than crypto) and a
nice Barlow piece on crypto (updating his piece a year ago in CACM).

Barlow even mentions "unless you're a real cypherpunk," so we're
entering the language.

I'd post the whole thing here, except that it's 1100+ lines. 

Definitely check it out!
