If memory serves me correctly, Phil's original PGP offered DES and bass-o-matic,
and the IDEA encryption was implemented in the Europeans PGP2.0 version
(though I don't know if it was done by Phil or by Europeans, I think the latter.)
This means that the IDEA implementation was imported by person or persons unknown,
presumably including Phil and many others.  During one round of Sternlight Wars,
I proposed doing a U.S. implementation, but John Gilmore convinced me that
importing software is legal under the then-existing ITAR wording.
This could be an opportunity to test it in court.
