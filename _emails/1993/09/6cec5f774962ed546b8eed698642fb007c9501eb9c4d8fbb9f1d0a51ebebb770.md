So, with such a translated algorithm, even if I had the complete
source code, I would be unable to determine what it does? If you
create one of these, be sure to submit it to the Obfuscated C

Got a good reference for ZPT? Something that the mathematically
inclined, who wants just the facts, all the facts, and none of
the BS that passes for explanations and which usually obscures
more than it clarifies?
