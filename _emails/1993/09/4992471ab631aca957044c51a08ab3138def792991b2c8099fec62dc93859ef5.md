To answer many of your questions, I am alive.  Ive been doing considerable
research and thus been unable to reply to much of my mail.  I am preparing to
write one or several articles for publication on the legal effects of the
internet and of course more specifically cryptography.  Unfortunately, in the
midst of my research i have come along a great deal more i could write about
then first thought.  So, I come to the list asking for input.
 
For those who do not know, Law Review articles help litigators to support
arguments that they need to make.  They are not primary authority but often
times one article will feed on another and develop into a school of thought.
It is important to break into this cycle in order to further legitimize our
(several) causes.
 
Among topics already considered:
      International Data Havens
      Digitial Cash
      Algorithmic Patents
      Electronic Signiture reliability
      Cryptographic Export Laws
      First Amendment and the Net
      Computers, Freedom and Privacy (I wonder if thats a copyright infraction)
      Fair Use Laws and general Copyright
      Telecommunication Laws Effects on Competitiveness
      And a General Overview of the Cryptography Controversy
 
I appeal to the list for further suggestions for topics as well as votes on
which topic is most important to establish now.  I am not locked in to any
particular topic right now but will need to get going soon.  Please forward any
sources (good technical papers and legal sources), and any ideas or thoughts
you may have.
 
To those who care, Im back.  To those who dont know me, Im back.  To those who
have offered help, I have not forgotten or abondoned ship, I will contact you.
BTW, glad to see so much activity on the list.  Keep up the good work.
