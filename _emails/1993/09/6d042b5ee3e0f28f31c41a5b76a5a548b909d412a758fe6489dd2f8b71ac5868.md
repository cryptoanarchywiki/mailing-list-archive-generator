So, what this means is that companies which produce information products
printed on paper (Newspapers, Magazines, etc..), and who contribute to
pollution (both as paper waste and as emissions into the environment in
the manufacturing, printing and transport of paper) and deforrestation pay
only a 4% sales tax to the state, while companies which sell information
electronically and produce no pollution or deforrestation pay a 9% tax to
the state.  Now there's a real insentive not to pollute the environment, NOT!

Cuomo is a FUCKING IDIOT! There, I've said it...

Il Duce must be pulled from his comfy office, hung upside down in a public
square in Albany, and repeatedly shot with high caliber weapons, and then
beaten to a pulp with baseball bats.

p.s. Mario, if you're reading this, repeal the tax now, you fucking bastard!
