I'm not absolutely clear on what you are suggesting, but I suspect that
alt.test can probably be made to serve your purposes.  Before the
password mess on penet (which kills automagic replies, unfortunately, as
they haven't passwords), I used the autoreplies that come form various
US & foreign sites in response to alt.test postings as a good shakedown
of penet remailer reliability.  I haven't messed with alt.test in a
while so have pretty much forgotten the drill, but it was definitely
useful at the time.
