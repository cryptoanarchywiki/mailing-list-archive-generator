Cypherpunks,

I have turned my old account (elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu) into a
cypherpunks remailer that supports BOTH pgp and ripem.  In addition to
the pgp pasting token

::
Encrypted: PGP

there is also a ripem pasting token

::
Encrypted: RIPEM

I've just tested the remailer with pgp, ripem, pgp nested inside
ripem, and ripem nested inside pgp, and all the messages have come
back successfully.

The installation went fairly quickly with Sameer's scripts; I
essentially added the necessary lines to the maildelivery file, copied
the pgpmail.pl file to ripemmail.pl (that's what I indicated in the
maildelivery file), altered ripemmail.pl to recognize RIPEM
message delimiters, and changed around the string that is built with
the $system call.

I apologize to those who have asked for a RIPEM remailer for taking so
long; I was bogged down trying to get RIPEM compiled on rosebud, an
HP/UX (cc, c89, -Aa flags: nothing worked; no gcc or disk space to
install gcc, unproto didn't help - I now think the compiler is way
broken).

The only drawback is that account is due to expire sometime.  Plus, if
many people decide to support ripem in addition to pgp the scripts are
going to need some reworking :-)  In order to update the dos batch
files I'll need an MSDOS ripem executable - has anyone seen any?
(Apparently I don't have a command line compiler to build it myself; I
have Turbo C++ for Windows)

Here are the public keys:
