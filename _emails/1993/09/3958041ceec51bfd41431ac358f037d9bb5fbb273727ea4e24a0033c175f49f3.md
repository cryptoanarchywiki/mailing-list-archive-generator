Mike,

	that's the theory but there is no proof that the signal was captured
with an authorized wiretap.  For that, the  key registration agents have
to trust the law enforcement agency.

	If the LE agency can be trusted, there's no need for the
key registration agencies.

	Part of the reason for encryption of communications is to guard
against illegal actions by law enforcement agencies.
