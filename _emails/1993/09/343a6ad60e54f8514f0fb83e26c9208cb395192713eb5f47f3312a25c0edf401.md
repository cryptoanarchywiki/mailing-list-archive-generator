Actually, they have issued such legal guarantees.  They're in the form of the
administration's vow to uphold the US Constitution.  That document's 9th and
10th amendments preclude US Government denial or disparagement of the people's
right to use cryptography (and a whole lot of others).  The fact that these
legal guarantees are being ignored simply illustrates that their tyranny is
unbridled.

By engaging NIST on this subject, the EFF is implicitly yielding to them
authority which is not theirs to begin with.
