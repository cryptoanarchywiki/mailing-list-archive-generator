	This is a message a friend of mine wanted me to post on the 'Net. 
I figured the Cypherpunk list would be one of the best places to start.

I am a Danish journalist, stationed in the US, writing for a daily newspaper in Copenhagen, mostly about technology, but also gennerally about culture. I am particularly interested in the political and ethical questions that computers and networks pose, pa
rticularly in regards to government and large corporations. I have covered a lot of hacker cases, and right now I am interested in the Kevin Poulsen, alias Dark Dante, case. I am looking for people who know Kevin. I can not understand why he has been 30 mo
nths now in custody without a court case. 

If anyone can help me, and are willing to talk to me, please write to my compuserve account, 75320,672 or internet: ogrunba@eis.calstate.edu - my name is Ole Grunbaum, and my newspaper is Politiken.
