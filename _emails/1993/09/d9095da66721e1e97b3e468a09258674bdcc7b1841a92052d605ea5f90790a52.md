As proposed in alt.config 2 Sep 1993.

The topic of the group is various organizations around the world
engaging in paramilitary action, intelligence, spying, covert
operations, ie. the "dark side" of governmental action or action
supported by governments but secret to nearly all citizens.  What kind
of political power do these organizations hold?  How do they use it?
Are they a threat to governments by the people or a threat to freedom
and democracy?  Are they "a necessary evil" in an unperfect world?

For your newsgroups file:
alt.politics.org.covert		Covert ("spook") organizations around the world
