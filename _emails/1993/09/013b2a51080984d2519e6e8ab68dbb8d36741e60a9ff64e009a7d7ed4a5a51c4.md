"Mike - you write that an FTP archive is a library open to the public.
While it looks like one to me, the important thing is convincing a grand
jury or jury that it's true, or heading off a prosecutor who'll try to paint
ftp archives as 'subversive hacker BBSs' or nonsense like that."

I don't think we disagree here.

"Do you know if anyone's doing this in an organized fashion?"

No. I'm really just making a prediction of what the likely outcome
of such cases will be.
