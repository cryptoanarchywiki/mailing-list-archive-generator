You should be aware of the possible results of your actions, however.  A 
market is a place where traders meet and trade.  It involves 
communications and transfer.  When governments intervene in markets, they 
do so by preventing these communications and transfers.  

When it becomes technically possible to exclude anyone you like (including 
the government) from your communications and transfers of non-physical 
goods and services, you have a free market.  Once these traders start 
trading a higher and higher proportion of the world's goods and 
services in this free market, government monopoly market controls are 
broken.  The world's governments become mere market actors like everyone 
else.  They lose sovereignty.  They can no longer govern (an 
ever-expanding 
portion of human activity).  They are no longer governments.

All from the simple ability to reliably communicate with total privacy.

Highgate Cemetery in North London.  Why?  See next Post for the answer.
