"godsdog" spelled backward is....

I wonder if anyone has ever gotten a good palindrome with their full
domain address? (Best to ignore the "." delimiters, for now.)

"limit@ti.mil" is a crude start, except that T.I. is not a military
site.

Our own "Abraham-Hughes" Cypherpunks team could have a user "mocha,"
as in the coffee, so that the address would be "mocha@ah.com".

I'll stop at that one.
