no doubt....I have a question for everyone though. How does anarchy
deal with justice and who would be the ones to provide this service. 
Because lets face it we all have days some more that others where we need
recourse..be it a dispute on your VISA b/c some @#T$#@$ warezhouse mailed you some crappy stuff and still won't give you back your money...

For me the decline of West. Civ. started when Blanche was raped by Stanley in 
_Streetcar_named_DESIRE_ by Tn. Williams...but to get back to my point
...hmmm what was it...oh!!!

The last vestiges of our gubbamess will be the judicial system
...beacuse we all have those days...

Also is society outside of our Ivory tower cases with twin cooling fans ready
for an anarchical harmony???

Bzzztt.. the internet is becoming a great place for commerce and trade concerns
to get up wit' each other...Trade Secrets and financial records need to be
protected from reverse-engineers who cannot think up a creative idea for them-
selves so they will steal it. Granted the IRS will soon be peeing in its empty
pants pockets to keep them full...but trade is another reason for crypts.
And not this reconstituted clipper shit the E.C. is toying with right now.
