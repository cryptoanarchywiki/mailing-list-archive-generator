Here's some more:
        authenticated signatures in regard to digital banking,
                direct democracy (both net and actual government),
		contract law, protection of sources in reporting,
		power of attorney, treaty signatures, anonymity of
		crime tips to police
	international bill of rights (some of these mechanisms potentially
		confer rights that certain governments do not)
	international law enforcement
	enforceability of information import/export restrictions
	evolution of international cooperative inter-government 
		institutions (UN, world courts, world banks, interpol, etc)
		to match evolution of international net activities
	jurisdictional issues of international net activities (what does
		location mean in the net? Can I send an information agent
		to do things that are legal in the target country but
		not locally? What if the target country is indeterminate?)
	future changes in interpretation of sovereignty
	impact of a hypothetical declaration of a new nation in cyberspace
		(considering technical ability to vote, trade, "print"
		currency, tax, implement and enforce contracts, negotiate
		treaties, etc)
	U.S. bill of rights and its transferability to net activities
	U.S. federal versus state jurisdiction over net activities
	ability of existing legal theory to adequately cover such topics,
		including strength of current theories of philosophy of law

Conceivably it's too early in the state of things to address some of these
topics, but they'll all arise at some point, will he nill he.
