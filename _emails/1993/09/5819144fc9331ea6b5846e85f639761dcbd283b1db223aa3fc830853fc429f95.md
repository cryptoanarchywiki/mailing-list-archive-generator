Okay.
 
I've gotten my collective thought processes back on track, how
'bout the rest of you?
 
Can we move forward -together- on the front for strong crypto?
 
Seeing as how Mr. P. (segway) Ferguson and Mr. Spooge(y) like
to use dictionary entries, I suggest this one as an "end-all"
for our current purposes -
 
team - \teem\  2 : a number of persons associated in work or
       activity; esp: a group on one side in a match.
 
 
We should be working as a team and not vetting petty on issues outside
of strong crypto.
