Please excuse the interruption.  I'm having problems signing
a text message with my secret key and creating output that leaves
the text message as is but with an ascii signature at the bottom.  
Or rather, I don't want the message encrypted, I just want the nifty sig
attached and email-able. 
{{
I've done this before using some combination of -sat or something similar
but I have since forgotten.  This is a rather embarrassing question, I
know it has to be a simple switch in the syntax but I spent 2 hours last
night and 1 hour this morning trying to figure the damn thing out... 
learned a few interesting things along the way.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please reply to me rather than
the list.  

Thank you,
