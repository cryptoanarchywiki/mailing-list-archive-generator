"The Gold at the Starbow's End", Frederik Pohl, Ballantine Books, 1972.
Serialized in Analog in '71 or 72. Great book!

You're showing your age. ;-)
( Like I'm not...if anyone on the list wasn't born at that point, I don't
wanna hear about it :-)

I think this was the first place I ever heard of Go"del numbering.
