Doesn't a patent have to have enough information for a person skilled
in the art to construct a prototype?  

I publish for the first time here my invention.  I will patent it within
a years time.

This isn't enough for anyone to do anything.  If I were more specific, I
might have something patentable, but then by claims wouldn't be as broad.
If you figured out how to make an anti-gravity device.  That device would
be patentable.  The concept of "anti-gravity" device is not patentable.
If I could duplicate the effect of your anti-gravity device without using
any of the same novel mechanisms.  My device would be separately patentable.
