Their spokesagency, NIST, has said that it will be illegal to encrypt
on top of Skipjack or to mung the LEEF.  Pre-encryption is not
mentioned, AFAIK, and would be borderline impossible to detect anyway.  

As I see it, this is already a restriction on non-Skipjack encryption,
issued in the same document that assured us that no such thing is being
considered.  It's a special case, to be sure, but it clearly asserts a
government power to restrict the means and manner of private
encryption performed entirely within the United States.  This is a key
issue, IMO.
