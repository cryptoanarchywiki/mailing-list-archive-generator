Some comments on the relationship between anarchy and
privacy: 

1.  There have been some recent posts suggesting that 
    privacy is not fundamentally subversive of 
    government, and that cypherpunks should emphasize  
    the privacy and keep quite about the anarchy.  I 
    find these arguments disingenuous in the extreme, 
    and strategically unsound as well. 

2.  Cypherpunks believe that privacy is fundamentally 
    subversive.  Come on, folks, whom do you want 
    privacy FROM, if not your own government?  
    Otherwise there's no logical objection to the 
    key-escrow, trust-big-brother schemes. 

3.  The government has shown by its behavior that it 
    believes that privacy is fundamentally subversive.

4.  I personally find privacy, in itself, only mildly 
    interesting.  As a tool to undermine the government, 
    I find it VERY EXCITING INDEED.

5.  Cypherpunks' mission is to evangelize the use of 
    privacy.  Sell the sizzle, not the steak!  Privacy
    is the steak.  The sizzle is the possibility of 
    GETTING AWAY WITH SOMETHING.
