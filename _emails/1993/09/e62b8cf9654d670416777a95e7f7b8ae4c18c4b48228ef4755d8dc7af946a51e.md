It would probably be ok to send to the list, though I suspect most of us have 
ftp access (it's available on ftp.vortex.com in pub/privacy/wiretap.laws.Z)
either directly by mail, and somebody will probably post it to Usenet soon.
Kaye is my local prosecutor, and while he's not as rabidly corrupt about 
forfeiture as some of the nearby county prosecutors, he's been relatively
energetic about using and supporting it and finding new things to 
forfeit property for.
