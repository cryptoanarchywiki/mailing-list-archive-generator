Been to "the fort" twice, once on 'official business', once on
a joyride around the 'campus'.  :-)  ("See them big sat dishes?
Don't want to get too close to them, marines with guns up there.")

The visitor's center has a small, but facinating museum of crypto
stuff, everything from enigma-style machines to a device that does
I-don't-remember-how-many-but-it-was-huge gigaflops on a hand-rolled
chip made on site, to a device for intercepting (and decrypting) microwave
transmissions.  Not much satilite stuff.  Pretty cool.

The guards all wear big (loaded, I checked) guns.  You're issued a
little badge to carry around your neck.  Get too far from your escort,
or in a room without your escort, and they get really upset (from what
I was told, I didn't try).

Across the highway is a state camp for delinquent boys.

Jim
