I like the first idea.  As an attorney (stop with the hissing out there!),
I feel a need to remind you that these State Department guys are serious. 
They can really make your life miserable -- just ask Phil Z.  I strongly
suggest that you keep that in mind before openly suggesting that you intend
to export encryption.  I agree that the export laws stink.  I'm hoping we
can get the law nixed without anyone going to jail.
