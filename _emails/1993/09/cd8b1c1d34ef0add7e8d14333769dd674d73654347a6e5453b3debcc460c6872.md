good choice,  I think a crypto library written for TCL or TCL/TK would
be nice.

I havent had alot of luck getting different add ons compiled for tcl/tk,
perhaps because I use one of the newer versions of tcl,  the tcp module
was one of them.

What we need most of all is an interface.  This is basically what
you are proposing.  Since tcl add-ons are usually written in C
I think it would be best off to start with a C library calling interface.
Once this is made, you could build a tcl shell (or a wish shell) on
top of it.  I expressed what I would like to see in a C library
interface a few days ago.  It would be based on PGP routines and
the PGP "shell" would be re-implemented over it.  I have gotten
no feedback on the idea at all.  Are there any members of the PGP
team on this list?  If not how could I get in touch with them?
This is an idea I really would like to see done, and which would
pave the way to coding alot of applications and interfaces to
PGP.  I would gladly work on such a project myself, but I am
afraid if I do my code will be both un-exportable and non standard
and will hence go unused.
