Can anyone point me to (1) a reasonably authoritative legal definition
of what "cryptography" means, that can be used to help decide precisely
what does and does not fall under e.g. the export restrictions, and (2) a
similar definition from the technical literature, to use in conjunction
with #1?

Hopefully I won't have to fall back on "I know it when I see it" standards. :-)
        Thanks,
                Doug
