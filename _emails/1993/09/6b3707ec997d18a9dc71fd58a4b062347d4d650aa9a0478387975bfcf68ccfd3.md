One possible problem is that the final destination must then be
available to every remailer.

Say I construct an appropriate header consisting of nested
encryptions, and I use it to send a letter from

me -> A -> B -> C -> destination

where A, B, C are the remailers I chose.  Say that there are a total
of 10 remailers in the universe that are known.

Here, A knows me and B, B knows A and C, and C knows B and
destination.

However, if A chooses a random remailer from [A-J], then it must
somehow make available the final destination to all of the remailers,
since there is a chance that the next hop will be destination.  Now
instead of C knowing the final destination, [A-J] do.

Even if I made C the "final" hop (and it will then forward to
destination), then I have to make C known to all the remailers, where
before only B knew C.

Besides, some people may have set up anonymous remailers that aren't
public or haven't been announced.
