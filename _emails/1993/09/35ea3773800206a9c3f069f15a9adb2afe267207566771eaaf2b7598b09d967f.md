Several thoughts come to mind:

- The difference between science fiction and fantasy can be very sharp.

- If wishes were horses then beggars would ride.

- Preaching to the choir is remarkably pointless.

I would also add that genetic algorithms are much too nice to
treat as mysterious magic that can solve any and all problems, but that's
doubtless obvious.
