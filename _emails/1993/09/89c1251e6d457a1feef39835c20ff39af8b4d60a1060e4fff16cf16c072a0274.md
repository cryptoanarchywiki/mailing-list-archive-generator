Yes, but this doesn't provide the service I desire. I *want* to be able
to sign a message, but I *only* want the intended recipient to know who
I am. PEM discloses the originator's ID *in the clear* when I send a
signed message. PGP hides the signature and all other information that
identifies me within the encrypted portion of the message!
