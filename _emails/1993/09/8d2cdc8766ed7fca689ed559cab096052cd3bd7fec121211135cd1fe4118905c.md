     My remailer certainly does not support a double hash!  If you want
to paste something into the header with my remailer, put it in the "::"
header block.  For example:

::
Request-Remailing-To: nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu
Subject: blah
Reply-To: an1234@anon.penet.fi
X-Pasted-By: nowhere

<body>

     It will ignore the "##" header block and send it as part of the body.

     By the way, chaos.bsu.edu is currently down...  I screwed up my boot
sector.  I was going to install NetBSD 0.9 anyway, so that's what I'll
do this afternoon or Thursday.
