There was a paper sometime back (10 years I would guess) called
"Sharing Secrets". For any j and k such that 0<j<k you could arrange
that the secret was divided into k parts, any j of which sufficed
to reconstruct the secret. Each part was the size of the secret.
Any collection of less than k parts yielded absolutly no information
even with exhaustive search.
 
If I have a third degree real polynomial y=f(x) and have computed y for
six different values of x then the polynomial can be resonstituted
from knowing any four of those <x, y> pairs. The secret was the
value of f(x) for yet another public value of x. The paper described
how to do this in finite fields.
