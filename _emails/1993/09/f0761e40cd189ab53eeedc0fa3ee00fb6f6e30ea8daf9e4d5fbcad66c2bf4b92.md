Cypherpunks,

Yes, strong crypto can be used for "good or evil."  That's true
of any tool.  And yes, dwelling on the darker applications may be
politically counter-productive.  But do any of you think that
curtailing such discussions will slow up the enemies of privacy
for one second?

Strong crypto is a threat to the powers that be.  Period.  We
know that, and so do they.  The will find reasons to try and stop
it.  If necessary, they will *manufacture* reasons.  They don't
care about kiddie porn or terrorism; they care about their power
base.  And their power base depends on their ability to extract
tribute.  Strong crypto and international diversification
undermine their ability to collect taxes.  They are going to
fight it no matter how innocuously we present ourselves.

I do think we should emphasize *attributes*, not particular
*applications*.  People who need strong crypto will understand
its potential.  We don't have to draw pictures.  As for the
"negative" uses, don't worry, our enemies will gladly describe
them.
