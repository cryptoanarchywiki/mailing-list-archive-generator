Messages sent to president@whitehouse.gov are weighed, not read. I
suspect this will have about as much effect on the president as a note
written in a bottle and tossed into the ocean.

However, on that basis, its perfectly harmless for you to send a
letter saying anything whatsoever other than a threat on the
president's life, so if you and others would like to spend time
writing such a thing, you can feel free. Just remember that there is
no cypherpunks organization, so you can't claim to represent us.
