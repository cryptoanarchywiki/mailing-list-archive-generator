You don't want to do that...  that would amount to using one seed
(probably when you created your key) and then generating a key from
that.  Since the relationship between a random seed and the IDEA key is
known, one can be reproduced from the other.  (to go from key to seed
would take considerably longer, but it's doable)  Since you are storing
what effectively amounts to the random number generated from the seed in
place of the seed, all an adversary has to do is get one of your IDEA
keys from a message that he can read.  Once he has that, he gets the
seed used, and then just works it forward from there.  Instead of having
2^128 possible keys, you've just let him narrow it down to a couple
hundred or so.  There's a reaason that you have to give it a new seed
rather often.
