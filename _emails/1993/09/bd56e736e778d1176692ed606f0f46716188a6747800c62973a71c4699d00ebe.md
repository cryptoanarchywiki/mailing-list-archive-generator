In the software I used (as recently as last Thursday) the keys are
_absolutely_, _positively_ generated locally.  Subsequently the public key
can be mailed automagically to RSADSI to be incorporated into a certificate
which is returned to you.  The latest version of RIPEM Mac uses the same
procedure for the same functionality.

  >>[...] users will get certified keys from RSA [...]

Yes!  _After_ sending RSADSI an uncertified key.


  >>[the user] can generate a key for use on their network

This is the uncertified key.


  >>Apple believes you'll want publically certified keys

Thus, they provide a mechanism to get RSADSI to certify your (self
generated) key.
