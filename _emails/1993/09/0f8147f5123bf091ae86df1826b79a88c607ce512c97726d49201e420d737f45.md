FIDONet operators are sometimes blocking encrypted messages. So what
else is new?

Their machines, their rules. Strictly speaking, this is not
censorship.

However, we can try to get them to change their rules. Better, route
around such machines.

John Gilmore has one of the best lines I've seen on this, quoted in
the new book by Howard Rheingold (something about "Living on the
Virtual Frontier," just out in the stores). John says something along
these lines:

"The Net tends to view censorship as damage and routes around it."
