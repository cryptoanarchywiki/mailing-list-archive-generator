The classic Roman Republic policy on information from enemy traitors was
to accept it, use it, kick the enemy's butt, and then kill the traitor. 
By the time of the Empire, haggling over price was a bit more flexible.
After all, if you're trying to protect your own city, winning is everything.
And if you're off trying to conquer other cities to increase the riches 
and power of the generals who run your army, honor's not a concept you
want to over-analyze :-)   For more precise references, and less cynicism,
you'll need to contact my 8th grade Latin teacher...
