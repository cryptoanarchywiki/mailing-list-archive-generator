No kidding. I just ftp'd the des_key_search.ps file from ftp.eff.org
and browsed through the first few pages (hats off to Michael for a 
fine piece of work). This is indeed an important milestone and will
have an impact on the cryptographic implementations used by banks, etc.
in the very near future. It should be interesting to see what the future
holds ....

That would be an interesting revelation, wouldn't it? ,-)
