One integrated large block cipher is much more secure than this kind of
combination of ciphers, unless you repeat them in enough rounds to make a
compound product cipher out of it.  In other words, des | tran really
isn't much stronger than des, but des|tran|des|tran|des|tran|des|tran...
could be quite strong (not to mention slow).

Long live the U. S. Constitution!
