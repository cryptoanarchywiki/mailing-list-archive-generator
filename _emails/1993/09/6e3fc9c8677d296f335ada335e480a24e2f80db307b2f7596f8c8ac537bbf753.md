There is no one such project. There are several of them that I know
of. If you think its an interesting thing to do, I strongly encourage
working on it on your own -- its not the sort of thing that requires
lots of people working on it, but it is the sort of thing that more
people talk about than do.

I fully agree.

Recent developments have been interesting on other fronts. 24kbps and
28kbps modems have arrived on the market, albeit at high prices. When
the final V.Fast standard comes in, 28kbps modems should cost only a
few hundred dollars. Although ordinary workstations can't do CELP fast
enough, GSM appears to be easily workable even on "normal" computers.

There is no case law or statute on this. The folks writing the laws
didn't understand computers and had no notion of the fact that it was
possible for someone physically outside the country to access
information physically inside the country. With luck, the case will
simply be overturned, and there may never be any case law defining
this silly form of "export".
