FYI, on sci.crypt W.H. Murray passes along quotes of D. Denning in an
article in Government Computer News, p14, Aug. 30, 1993 by Kevin Power.
If anyone could scan this for the cypherpunk collection it would be appreciated.

In the same article kevin Power quotes Denning as having said "The
people at NSA have done more to evaluate than the public algorithm in
DES.  They're way ahead of the game."

I hope Dr. Denning never said anything like that for the record.  Even
if it were true, it would not be knowable.  It would be unprofessional
to make such an unscientific assertion.
