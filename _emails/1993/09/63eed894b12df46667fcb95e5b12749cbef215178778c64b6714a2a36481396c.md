If you think prices are outrageous, let the software manufacturers know.
Let your friends know,  let everyone know.  The reason they charge such
prices is because they can.  The reason they can is because people let
them.  Even better, support free software alternatives, and get your
friends to do the same.

warez has little to do with cypherpunks other than the fact that
warez dewds can use crypto technology to help protect themselves
against overly strict and mostly industry driven laws against
piracy.  Warez is used more as an electronic ego booster than
a currency.

support the cause you believe in.  By the same token dont support evil
software companies *even by stealing their software!*  Use alternatives.
Stealing their software doesnt hurt them (contrary to what you would have
them believe).  Supporting free software and any competitors they have
who have plolicies you approve does hurt them.
