I've been spending the week in Washington DC, so I went by the Public
Search Room of the U S Patent and Trademark office and requested the
complete files on the four patents named in rfc1424 (see below).

I have photocopies of nearly the complete folders, which include the
initial proposed patent and all the written communication between the
patent attorney and the patent examiner.  (I think all four of these
patents had all of their claims rejected on the first pass.)  You see
the patent examiner explain what is wrong, criticizing the patent, and
the subsequent ammendments and more rejections until the patent is granted.
(This is important information if one wishes to challenge a patent.  You
can see how various arguments were dealt with before and what likely
responses from patent examiners are.)

I'll bring all of this to the October Mountain View cypherpunks
meeting, assuming it is Sat Oct 9.  I'll also try and be ready to
summarize the history of each patent.  

What are missing from my copies are mostly legal communications that
had no techincal interest -- powers of attorney & calculations of
fees.   I also omitted most of the published articles that were
referenced (several other patents and some scholarly papers) and some
seemingly redundant diagrams.  Of course, I also have copies of the
final patents granted.

The Search Room is an interesting place.  I pulled several faux pas
and got quite an education in patents and federal offices....
