"Cypherpunks Hack Hardware"

  It seems logical that when the ClipperPhones come out, they will have
some kind of vocoder chip in them. (I doubt the (co)decoding will be
implemented on the Clipper chip itself) If so, cypherpunks can
take advantage of this situation. By hacking up a daugherboard, the phone's
vocoder/modem/sampler can be exploited and interfaced to a PC (possibility
via something as simple as a null modem cable or centronics). After that,
the software hackers can do their job.

  If the ClipperPhone becomes popular and the daughterboard is cheap to build
($25-50), it would serve as a massive hardware platform for cypherpunks
phone software. The alternative is to produce our own vocoder/sampler boards,
but I doubt we could approach the economy of scale that AT&T can, plus
we get to ride on the back of their advertising/marketing by having them
sell the basic hardware. (then we just release a hack for it)

 What do you think?
