In the spirit of the Second Annual Cypherpunks Conference in the
Bay Area this Saturday, here are a variety of visions for future 
crypto-anarchy:

* GUIs for X, Mac, & Windows that make PGP mail encryption & key handling,
anon remailer envelope-stuffing, etc. seamless
* mobile.com: pirate crypto ham and shortwave on the Internet
* How much computing power and radio gear can be crammed into a
van?  An RV?  A yacht?
* Fiber or hi-bandwidth satellite hookup for RV parks and yacht berths
* Itinerant hackers, indigent anarchists, and perpetual
tourists.  Physical crypto-raves for cyberspace biz & social partners
* Discovering, debugging, and implementing true software digicash
(upon which the following visions depend!)
* Distributed digicash banking, offshore, virtually & physically mobile
* International digicash telecommuter contracting: programming,
publishing, typing pools, etc.  Crypto-anarchy for the middle
class; pirate CD-ROM libraries for the 3rd World masses.
* Internet Casino: why travel to Las Vegas or Monte Carlo when 
you can play the finest games in the privacy of your own home?
* Integration of BBS businesses (already >$1 billion per
year) into the digicash economy
* Effective law enforcement approaches terrorism: random hits
against fixed, centralized physical targets to generate intimidating 
publicity
* Millions of jobs for college grads and military-industrial complex 
workers: future digicash-related markets in the $trillions per year
