I know this is not what you're looking for, but I'm in a very
strange mood today:

Note:     The following material was handed out a press briefing on the
          Clipper Chip on 4/16.

              For Law Enforcement to Read a Suspect's Message
 
1.  Need to obtain court authorized warrant to tap the suspect's telephone.
 
2.  Record encrypted message
 
3.  Use chip family key to decrypt chip serial number
 
4.  Take this serial number *and* court order to custodians 
    of disks A and B
 
5.  Add the A and B components for that serial number = the chip
    unique key for the suspect user
 
6.  Use this key to decrypt the user's message key for 
    this recorded message
 
7.  Finally, use this message key to decrypt the recorded message.
