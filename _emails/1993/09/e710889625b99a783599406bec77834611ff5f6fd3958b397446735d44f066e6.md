For god's sake, how many copies of this trash are we going to get?
If you're going to use anonymous remailers to mailbomb our list, at

PS To the person who was bragging about using a spelling checker to
hide his anonymity, erm... have a closer look at your post, buddy!
I don't think it would take more than 10 minutes with an index of
all usenet postings over the last month or two to find you :)
