Hi, I do agree with your concepts for a public key voice system.
I don't think Joel will be up to speed for a long time<G>.

Re: SOURCE CODE

I will snail mail you the Call Security source and exe's today. You
should have them by tomorrow or Saturday. Please post them on an FTP,
so that any of the cypherpunks can get a copy.

TO ALL EAVES DROPPERS<G>

If you need the source snail mailed to you, then send a floppy any
size to:

Colston & Associates
5111 Rogers Ave. Suite 507
Fort Smith, AR 72903

I'll stand good the return postage, but the disks will help out.
