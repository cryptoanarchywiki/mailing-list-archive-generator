My actual horoscope for today:

"A paradox: Someday, millions will read your words, and yet you shall be 
anonymous!  Your ability to mediate makes you friends with opposing 
parties."

The joke of the day from an AP report on the veep's Information Highway 
press conference:

"American industry already is out front in high-tech development, but a 
fear exists that better coordinated government-industry relationships in 
other countries may give an edge to foreign competition."
