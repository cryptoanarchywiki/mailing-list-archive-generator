Re. Representative Sam Gejdenson (pronounced as if spelled "gaydenson",
accent on first syllable):  I went to one of his campaign appearances when
he first ran for office (this was Middletown Connecticut, 1980), and was
very much impressed by his positions on various issues, and in particular,
his background knowledge in a number of areas including engineering and
policy areas related to the environment.... he is definitely someone who has
a good ability to digest and utilise technical information in detail, and
I'd say he could be a very very key person on our side of these issues.  He
definitely deserves 100% support and all the solid detailed information we
can provide.
