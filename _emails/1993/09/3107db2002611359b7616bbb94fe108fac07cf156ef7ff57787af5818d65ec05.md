Doug,
 
I'm not sure how much it will help you in distinguishing your objective,
but one of the best general purpose references that I have seen is the 
sci.crypt Usenet newsgroup FAQ. It's posted occasiuonally to sci.crypt,
but I can't think of a site (offhand) where you can FTP it. If you have
access to a gopher or WAIS, give that a try.
 
Cheers,
