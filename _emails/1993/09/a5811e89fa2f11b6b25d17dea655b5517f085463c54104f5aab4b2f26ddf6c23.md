I would guess that they're not willing to put up with the export law nonsense
required to export the product.  (If they do, more power to them!)
If the offensive export-prevention laws weren't there, and if other governments
didn't have offensive import-harassment and crypto-harassment laws,
then they'd probably decide whether they could make enough money by providing a 
supported product and pretty manuals to people who can get the net-version free,
just as companies like Cygnus are providing commercial support for free GNUware.
However, governments have not yet realized that they're obsolete, 
so you folks won't have that option. :-(
