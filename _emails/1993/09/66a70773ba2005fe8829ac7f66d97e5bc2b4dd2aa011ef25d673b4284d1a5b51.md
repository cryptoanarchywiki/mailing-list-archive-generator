Sorry to say that you're a bit confused. The question was how to provide
justice under anarchy. I said something about voting. You jumped to the
assumption that I was talking about voting for government elections. This
is not the case. I was talking about voting on issues of justice, as
in a jury. You may want to reread my post with this in mind.

As for voting for government in cyberspace, it all depends on the other
assumptions. Should there be a virtual government? Should voting for
physical-world governments take place on the net? Etc, etc. There is
currently no active discussion going on about any of this, so there is no
framework for commenting on voting for such things.
	Doug
