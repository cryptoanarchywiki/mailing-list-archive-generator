>      The FCC should allow bidders to purchase the smallest
>      possible blocks of the spectrum, while providing for

>      By choosing the smallest possible blocks of spectrum to

>      spectrum to a potentially large group of license holders,
>      who can be expected to consider a wider range on innovative
>      PCS services.  However, some important PCS services may
>      require the larger bandwidth.  The FCC can easily
>      accommodate this problem by allowing bidders to aggregate
>      and consolidate spectrum blocks, in order to offer higher
>      bandwidth services.  The aggregation and consolidation of
>      spectrum blocks should be subject to an FCC finding that the
>      new allocation is in the public interest. This procedure
>      would allow more flexibility in determining the size of
>      allocation blocks with each market, and provide better
>      opportunities for smaller firms to bid on spectrum.

> to provide useful PCS services.  By beginning with the "smallest

> TAP CAUTIONS AGAINST BIDDING METHODS THAT RELY EXCESSIVELY UPON
> UP FRONT CASH PAYMENTS
> 
>      TAP also told the FCC the auction should not rely
> excessively on up front cash payments.  The federal government
> can structure the payments on the license in a number of ways,
> including up front cash payments, fixed payments spread out over
> several years, or payments which are contingent on future cash
> flows, such as royalties on future revenues or units of services
> provided.
> 
>      The PCS spectrum auction will be the largest non-financial
> auction held by the federal government.  But the economic value
> of a PCS license will depend upon a highly uncertain cash flow
> over the long period of time.  If the FCC auctions the licenses
> to the highest cash bidders, the government will be asking firms
> to pay now for the rights to enter a business that will not be
> fully developed for many years.
> 
>      TAP raised two objections to excessive reliance upon up
> front cash payments to auction the spectrum.  First, many smaller
> firms will be unlikely to raise enough cash to bid against the
> larger incumbents in the telecommunications markets.  Second,
> bidders will discount the future "economic rents" from licenses
> by a higher "discount rate" than the government's costs of
> capital (the rate of interest on its bonds), leading to excessive
> discounting of license revenues.
> 
>      In order to promote more competition in the auctions, and
> also to increase the present value of license payments, TAP urges
> the FCC to consider a bidding system that combines cash payments
> with payments that are contingent upon future PCS revenues, such
> as a royalty on future PCS revenues.  We believe that over the
> long run, the government (the taxpayers) will earn more from
> royalties on a mature PCS market, than it will earn from up front
> cash payments for licenses.
