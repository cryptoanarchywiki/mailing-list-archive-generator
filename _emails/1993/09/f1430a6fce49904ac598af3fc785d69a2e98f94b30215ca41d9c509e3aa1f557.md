He is American, I presume?  Sorry to draw this tangent even further out,
but I can't resist pointing out that in the UK it is perfectly legal to
give whiskey and keys (car keys, I assume) to a 17 year old, and the
heavens have not fallen.  "Petrol and matches to a 5 year old" might be a
better comparison.
