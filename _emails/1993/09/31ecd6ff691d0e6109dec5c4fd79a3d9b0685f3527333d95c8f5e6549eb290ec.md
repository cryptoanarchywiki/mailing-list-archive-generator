	 thought for the day;


	  In Starfleet, all communications are encrypted automatically.
	 Although there is no honor in knowledge gained through stolen
	 transmissions, some of our enemies have no honor. A true Klingon
	 does not "sneak"-he shouts into the face of his enemy. But I have
	 seen many types of dishonor, and so I am prepared for it.

	                -Lieutenant Worf,chief of security, U.S.S.Enterprise


	  From the star trek next generation book "20th century computers
	 and how they worked" by Jennifer Flynn published by alpha books.
	 ISBN 1-56761-257-1

Hardly a new sentiment.  From Kahn:

	``Gentlemen do not read each other's mail''.  Henry Stimson,
	Secretary of State, 1929, shutting down the American Black Chamber.

In 1940, Stimson was Secretary of War, and a recipient of MAGIC....
