According to idea.c in the PGP sources:

 *      Algorithm developed by Xuejia Lai and James L. Massey, of ETH Zurich.
 *      This implementation modified and derived from original C code
 *      developed by Xuejia Lai.

Of course, idea.c and PGP as a whole have been substantially improved
by an international community; importing their warez may be as much of
an "offense" as importing IDEA.  (Certainly the prosecution of these
actions is equal in absurdity.)
