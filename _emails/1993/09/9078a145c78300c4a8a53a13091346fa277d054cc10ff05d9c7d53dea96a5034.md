Meanwhile, where is the proof that the key being requested corresponds to
a person on whom a wiretap has been ordered?


When I saw a preliminary briefing given to the CSSPAB, the DOJ suggested
that there would be no list kept equating names to Clipper Chip ID #.
Of course such a list would be a real disaster because people would
routinely be shifting hardware left and right. Any list would become
immediately out of date. 

This means that there is really no feasible way to discover misuse.
