I'd be surprised if they allow you a month or two for more comments.

My current fantasy about Clipper is that the NSA did a deal with AT&T,
demanding removal of DES chips in favor of Skipjack, getting AT&T to buy
into a limited delay in product introduction with the gov't promising to
get the Skipjack standard in place by Summer so that the AT&T phones
weren't held up too long.

That's all out of my own head, but it hangs together.

Does anyone know specifics about AT&T's prior plans?  Was there
a DES version?
