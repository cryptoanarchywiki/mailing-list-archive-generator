des | tran is exactly as secure as des.  A final tran adds nothing.  It
looks messed up to a human, but there's no cryptographic value added.

tran is of value *only* between two strong ciphers and its only value is to
increase the size of the block affected by the surrounding ciphers.

Try the new tran. The one originally posted had a slow (LC) PRNG.
The new one uses subtract-with-borrow and it's faster.

Another consumer warning:  the s-w-b PRNG has a huge period but that doesn't
make it cryptographically secure.  If anything, this is probably the easiest
PRNG to break.
