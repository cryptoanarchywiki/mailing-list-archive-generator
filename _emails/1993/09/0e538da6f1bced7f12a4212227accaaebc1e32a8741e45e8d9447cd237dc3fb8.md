FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 
A new trade association, the National Online Media Association
(NOMA), was formed at ONE BBSCON '93 in Colorado Springs on August
27th, 1993.  NOMA comprises BBS operators, Internet service
providers, and other online media and services. 
 
NOMA's mission is to act for the BBS and online service industry
on matters of national importance by creating an industry presence
in Washington, D.C. and other means; assist its members at the
state and local levels; educate the public on the unique social,
business and legal roles of BBS's and other online services;
establish appropriate industry standards and guidelines; 
promote business development in the industry; and maintain and 
provide access to resources and industry information for use by the
public and the industry. 
 
An 11 person Organizing Committee was elected to develop a proposal
for NOMA's charter, bylaws, membership requirements, structure, and
form of leadership.  The proposal is to be completed and
distributed within the BBS and online services industry by November
30th, 1993. 
 
Discussion areas are being set up immediately for those interested 
in participating in NOMA's early development.  An Internet mailing 
list is available to all those interested at natbbs@echonyc.com 
(subscribe to natbbs-request@echonyc.com).  A conference area is 
also being made available on the Delphi national information 
service.
