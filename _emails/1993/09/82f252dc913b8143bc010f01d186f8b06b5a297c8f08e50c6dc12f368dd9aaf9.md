Pardon my cynicism, but I think I know why.
These little judges really, really, want to be appointed Supremes.  So
they aren't likely to rule in a fashion which will threaten the
potential interests of a current or future US president.  Since the
natural goal of government is to accrue power, there seems to be a
safe prediction of what those future interests will be.
