>(p.s. I have no idea why they call them "cool" links)

"cool" links are the opposite of "hot links". The latter are active;
nontrivial computation is done when the link is followed. The former
are passive and merely point to information.

Hypertext jargon.

Then again, the man page you quoted implies that the author just
thinks that such things are cool.
