The newsgroup comp.sources.reviewed has just released the sources to
"mpack", a utility for encoding binary files into a MIME-compliant
format, then mailing them to recepients or posting them to a
newsgroup.  "munpack", a utility for decoding the files, is also
included.  The package is supposed to work on MS-DOS and MacOS
systems (and it's quite small), so people playing with PGP might be
able to get some use out of it.
