Cypherpunks,

Chael has made the necessary changes, and the cypherpunks gopher now 
listens to port 70 as standard gophers do...

So 'gopher chaos.bsu.edu' or 'gopher 147.226.53.28'.

I will look into announcing the site to the gopher list maintainers at
UMN; perhaps some sites that are able to look up chaos.bsu.edu
consistently will consider including a pointer to us!
