You could write one based on Richard Outerbridge's d3des.
The essential routines are provided in the package, all you'd
need to provide is the wrapper. d3des is the basis of what is currently
used in RIPEM 1.1

I also used it in munge, which is an experimental encryption program 
I distributed a while back which encrypts with either IDEA or triple 
DES or a composition of the two in CFB mode. munge has an interface 
much like that of Unix "compress" (munge, unmunge, mcat &c.) I'd do 
things somewhat differently if I were going to redo it, but you can 
have it if you want it. Just don't ask me to maintain it or port it 
to anything else, as I don't want to put any more effort into it. 
There is significant ugliness in the code due to the fact that I was 
always maintaining backwards compatibility with previous versions. 

(if you want either munge or d3des, you can get by ftp it from either 
wimsey.bc.ca or ripem.msu.edu. Please don't export munge or anything 
from wimsey.bc.ca outside of the U.S. and Canada).
