Cypherpunks:

I spoke just now with Maria Nekam, the owner of Austin Code Works. She is 
doing fine, has complied with the request for documents, and believes that
her company has nothing to hide. She believes that they have taken all
reasonable precautions to prevent the export of the DES materials.

Interestingly enough, she had been contacted by the NSA a couple of weeks
ago, and informed of the restrictions on exporting DES, although she was
already complying with these restrictions.

I asked if there was anything that the various organizations could do 
to help; she feels that the situation is under control.

When asked about her opinion of the DES export restrictions, she declined
to comment, saying that her company was just a small player and she didn't
want to get involved. 

I told her about the crypto conference we are having (coincidentally?) on
the same day as the hearing. Since her presence is not required at the
hearing, she will try to attend.

As I was writing the above, my phone call to Theodore R. Siggins, the
customs agent mentioned in the subpoena was returned. We spoke briefly;
he was friendly but felt "it would be inappropriate for me to comment on 
any matters concerning the grand jury." When I asked him if this was part
of an overall crackdown on cryptography export, he referred me 
to the special agent in charge, Leonard Lindheim, (202) 229-4561.
