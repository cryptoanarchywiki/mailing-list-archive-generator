In case any one is interested, I have the source code for a non-RSA
public key system. I wrote it in Microsoft PDS 7.1, which is a
version of quick basic. It does 1024 bit keys and I can out run PGP
in Basic<G>.

If anyone out there is a semi-mathematical type, I will also furnish
a paper on the subject. Since this is non-RSA and I'm sure everyone
reading this is in the U.S., I don't think I'm involation of ITAR<G>.
