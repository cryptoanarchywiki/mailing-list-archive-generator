	At the urging (urging, bah!-- I *wanted* a task-- He could've
probably seen it in my eyes) of Eric Hughes, I have been working on a
script so that the installation of an anonymous remailer (with PGP) is
as easy as typing install_remail. At this point it works *flawlessly*
on *my* system, so I'd like to see how it works on other systems.
	This is still an interim version, however, for it is not idiot
proof. A small typo (such as mistyping the pathname of your pgp
executable) will mean that you have to start over. That will change,
but probably in another version. I want to get this out as quickly as
possible so that more remailers can pop up like wildfire, and *then*
I'll work on idiot-proofing it, so that *everyone* with a UNIX account
and crypto-anarchist leanings (no matter their tech-expertise) can be
running a remailer.
	This script in the non-idiot-proof version needs that
~/.forward and ~/remail both don't exist.

	If you'd like to help me test this thing, and see if it works
on your system, please mail me, with some info about your system and
your tech expertise. (So I know what to expect.)
	(I'm setting Reply-To: to both this account and
cs60a-qu@cory.eecs.berkeley.edu, because cs60a-qu is where the
install_remail-installed remailer is running there. [It may go down at
any moment, so it would be appreciated if people could use it and test it,
but at this point it wouldn't be wise to rely on it for anything
important.])

Peace,
