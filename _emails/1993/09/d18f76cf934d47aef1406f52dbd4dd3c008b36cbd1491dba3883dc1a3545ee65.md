thought for the day;


 In Starfleet, all communications are encrypted automatically.
Although there is no honor in knowledge gained through stolen
transmissions, some of our enemies have no honor. A true Klingon
does not "sneak"-he shouts into the face of his enemy. But I have
seen many types of dishonor, and so I am prepared for it.

               -Lieutenant Worf,chief of security, U.S.S.Enterprise


 From the star trek next generation book "20th century computers
and how they worked" by Jennifer Flynn published by alpha books.
ISBN 1-56761-257-1
