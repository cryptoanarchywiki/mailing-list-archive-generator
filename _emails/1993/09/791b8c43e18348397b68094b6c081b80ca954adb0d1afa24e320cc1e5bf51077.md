-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Earlier, I mentioned my stab at a positive reputation scheme for
anonymous mail.  I made some changes to the script I posted earlier
(which I discovered was truncated because of a lone period on a line -
PERL's marker for ending a format specifier).

The script sifts through an elm folder, reporting message number,
email address of author, and subject.  When a pgp signed message is
found, it sends the message through pgp, extracting the signature and
reports that instead.  (At the moment I'm not sure what happens if the
public key needed to verify the signature isn't on your keyring, or if
a signature is bad).

Positive reputations, digital postage, and easier methods for replying
are a solution for the "how to mark anonymous mail" question which
crops up from time to time.  That is, you don't mark anonymous mail -
instead, in the future, mail readers will be capable of getting the
digital signature from a mail message and reporting it, of replying to
anonymous mail, etc.

I mean, who wrote the message is what you are really interested in,
now so much how it got to you (via anonymous remailing chains, etc.).

Positive reputations and digital postage are more appealing to me
because I'm a "purist" - I'm more interested in "pulling it off"
(anonymous mail) than in other concerns.  Marking anonymous mail with
certain subject headers and so forth is an unacceptable solution to
me.

Now, there isn't a requirement that the signature on the message be
for a "real" person - a good positive reputation system would allow a
person to adopt a pseudonym (ala Demosthenes and Locke in Card's
_Ender's Game_) and speak via that pseudonym.  When you read your mail
and you note messages are from "Demosthenes" and you agree with the
opinions expressed, you will mentally note that Demosthenes is
intelligent, and be willing to read further message.  On the other
hand, if you feel Locke is an idiot, you will skip messages, or set
your advanced email filters to reject the messages.

I thought about a possible real life example, and this came to mind:
suppose David Sternlight, heartened by a legal PGP, decided he was
going to blow off USENET and instead participate here, on cypherpunks.
He knows that for many, merely seeing the email address
"strnlght@netcom.com" will cause a variety of reactions :-).  So he
could form a pseudonym for himself and participate, allowing himself
to start afresh.

Following is the script.  It is inefficient (the while loop that
drives the thing needs massive reworking, pgp is called to get a
signature from a document) but eventually these will be fixed (I'll
rewrite the loop, a pgp library will be made available).  Plus, as I
said above, I'm not sure what happens with bad signatures or missing
public keys.  Also, to prevent some mailer from truncating this post,
I'll move the formatting period over by a space - this will cause a
"format not terminated" error if you try to run this script without
moving the period back!

Here's how I use it: scan cypher

where cypher is an elm mail folder.  I get back a report that looks
like this:

   1  collins@newton.apple.com   blank lines v. the remailer
   2* Karl L. Barrus <klbarrus@o REMAIL: cache
   3  collins@newton.apple.com   Re: anon.penet.fi
   4  hfinney@shell.portal.com   Restrictions on crypto exports
   5  mccoy@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu   money money money...
   6  nobody@soda.berkeley.edu   Re: your mail
   7  ld231782@longs.lance.colos remailer ideas
   8  ld231782@longs.lance.colos list split?
   9  0005542837@mcimail.com     PKZ and NON-RSA
  10  derek@cs.wisc.edu          Re: Why RSA?
  11  hfinney@shell.portal.com   Propriety of crypto on Munitions List
  12  hfinney@shell.portal.com   First amendment and ITARs
  13  hfinney@shell.portal.com   Mail outage
  14  frissell@panix.com         Propriety of crypto on Mu
  15  frissell@panix.com         Regulating the Nets

The asterisk means message 2 is pgp signed by "Karl L. Barrus" - the
rest of what pgp reports is truncated.
