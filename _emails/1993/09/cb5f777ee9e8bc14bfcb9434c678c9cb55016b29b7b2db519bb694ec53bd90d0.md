This is both a fair comment and a fair request. Sorry for being irritable
yesterday.

This is not an accurate presentation of 2515, Steve. "Electronic
communications" was not added to 18 USC 2515 by ECPA. The statutory
exclusionary rule applies only to wire and oral communications.

You've missed the actual language of 18 USC 2515. I don't know where you
got this one.
