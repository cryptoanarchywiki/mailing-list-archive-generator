An economic analysis would indeed be useful, especially if it led to 
poll-type question like "Would you be willing to pay $100 extra for
a cellular phone to get secure communications that allowed government 
wiretaps?"

Or as a sound bite:  "At $100M+ a year, consumers and businesses are 
subsidizing government wiretapping at the minimum cost of 
$100,000 for each wiretap."

At that price, the government might as well give $100k to the suspects
under the condition that they stop doing whatever is considered illegal. ;^)
