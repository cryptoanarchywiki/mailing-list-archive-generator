[This is original.]

In view of the recent burglaries at computer warehouses in the Silicon Valley,
where the burglars have stolen Intel's x86 processor chips, Intel has decided
to use a new corporate slogan. The idea for this slogan is based on the
theft-resistant stickers seen on the windows of cars in NYC.

All stores carrying/manufacturing PCs made with Intel's processors, as well
as the PCs themselves will now bear a sticker that says:

	"No Intel Inside".
