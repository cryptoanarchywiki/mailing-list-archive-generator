Not necessarily. If the "post this message to alt.remailer" command
for a smart message were executed via splitting off another message
with its own encrypted header and path through the remailers to an
anonymous posting service. (as suggested by miron@extropia.wimsey.com)

I agree this could certainly be a problem (esp. executed as above.)

No I'm not implying that. But there really isn't any way doing that
could make such an analysis *harder*, as by splitting pieces of the
message off, you have multiple parts all going to the same
destination.  This gives the attacker redundant paths to follow,
and if the attacker can trace *any* message, he can discover
the identity of the recipient. There would be no "dead-ends" for
the attacker. (when I say "follow" I don't necessarily mean follow
in a literal sense, but any traffic based statistical analysis.)

I agree this is the major problem, with the current state of the
remailers, but it may not be a problem with a stable remailer web and
an "anonymous address server" (see my long laborious boring posts
regarding this from about a week ago.)

I don't think so. This way there is only one (or a few) paths that
actually would lead to the recipient, and many "blind alleys" for an
attacker to follow. With the multiple-pieces-same-destination scheme
*any* one path would be enough to determine the recipient.

	Doug> Cool. More info?

I'm not saying that CRM actually uses a command language (it can't--
nothing has been agreed upon/worked out yet!) but tools like CRM
would be able to use a remailer command language to tailor the
message's (or anonymous address block's) anonymity protection.
See that same long, boring post I made about a few suggestions
for what such a language could contain/be useful with.

A remailer command language could include instructions to
specify how long to hold this message (possibly to be combined
with some remailer batching functions.)
