I guess you didn't get it huh? 
I'm really sick of the flame wars on here, but this one had me laughing
on the floor.

in COLLABORATION with THE masons AND the ILLUMINATI!!!!!!!! AND....

(insert some more paranoid conspiracy rantings with every other word
in all caps and wildly excessive exclamation points....)

     and

cypherparanoid-list (for those that want to robo-repost articles from other
                     newsgroups with paranoid comments.)
