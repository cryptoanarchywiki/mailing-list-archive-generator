Whitfield Diffie is best known for his 1975 discovery of the concept of
public key cryptography, for which he was recently awarded a Doctorate
in Technical Sciences (Honoris Causa) by the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology.

For a dozen years prior to assuming his present position in 1991,
Diffie was Manager of Secure Systems Research for Northern Telecom,
functioning as the center of expertise in advanced security
technologies throughout the corporation.  Among his achievements in
this position was the design of the key management architecture for
NT's recently released PDSO security system for X.25 packet networks.

Diffie received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1965.  Prior to becoming
interested in cryptography, he worked on the development of the Mathlab
symbolic manipulation system --- sponsored jointly at Mitre and the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory --- and later on proof of
correctness of computer programs at Stanford University.  He is the
recipient of the IEEE Information Theory Society Best Paper Award for
1979 and the IEEE Donald E. Fink award for 1981.
