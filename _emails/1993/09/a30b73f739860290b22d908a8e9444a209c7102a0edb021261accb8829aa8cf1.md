Now that you mention it...
	I never had that problem before, I've sent messages with up to
three blank lines before the :: with no prob, I don't know about more than
three. But a few days ago somebody tried to remail through mine and the
message ended up in my mailbox, I looked at the message content and did
everything I could to figure out what happened, but the only thing I could
come up with was that maybe the :: was not on the first line like it
should be and that screwed it up. (clarification: The :: was on the second
or third line for sure, if that was the cause of the problem or not I
don't know.)

Happy Hunting, -Chris
