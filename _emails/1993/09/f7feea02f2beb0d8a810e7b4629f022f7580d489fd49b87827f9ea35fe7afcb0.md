The DAT coding is 16 bit fixed point. The lowest bit always has
the same value which is nearly 90 db below the loudest sound.
This is perceptible when it is the only signal as is demonstrated 
in CD demonstrator disks. A steganographer might merely not put
data in quiet passages. Alternatively he could plausibly claim that
it was caused by a gentle breeze outside the recording studio. In the
later case he should add some noise to the next to bottom bit,
or generate and add some -85 db white noise and then replace the
bottom bit.
