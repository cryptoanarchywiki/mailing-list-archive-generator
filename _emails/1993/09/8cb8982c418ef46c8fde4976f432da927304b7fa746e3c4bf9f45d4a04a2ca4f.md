	I have run into a rather embarrasing problem with PGP. I
accidentally deleted the secret key to my cory remailer. Luckily, I
have kept a backup of all my remailer keys in a safe place, so I still
have it. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to extract the cory
secret key from the keyring containing the secret keys for my other
remailers.
	pgp -kx and pgp -kr work quite fine for the public keys, but I
can't get them to work for the secret keys. (All 6 keys were on the
same keyring.)
	Any help?

	(Because of this problem, PGP on cs60a-qu@cory.eecs.berkeley
isn't working-- if you want to do pGP through one of my remailers, use
sameer@soda.berkeley.edu or sameer@netcom.com)
