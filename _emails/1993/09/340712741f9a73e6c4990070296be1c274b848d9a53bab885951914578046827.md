It was signed by Dorothy Denning, right?

Actually, they should take that to its full conclusion.

We need implants in every individual, broadcasting to the local
surveillance agency, giving not only location but also every word spoken in
the vicinity.  It could also do a chemical analysis of the air in the
neighborhood.  It should also have a radiation counter.  It should also
monitor the host body, looking for signs of anger or sexual arousal?

How else will we be guaranteed safe from mad bombers, rapists and child
molesters?  How else will our big budget LE agencies be able to protect us?

I know.  When it's finally adopted, worldwide, they'll call it
the Ellison Plan. :-(
