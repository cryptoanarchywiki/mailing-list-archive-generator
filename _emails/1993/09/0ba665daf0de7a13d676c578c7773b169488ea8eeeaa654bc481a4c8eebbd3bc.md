Lance, calm down.  PRZ and ViaCrypt have their own lawyers.  Mike
Godwin in contact with PRZ, and we all saw Shari's message from the
exec dir of the EFF, so they are involved.

We are technologists, not lawyers.  For now, I'll let the lawyers
formulate the response to this attack.  They know the game better than
you or I do.  When my help is requested, they'll get it.

For now, we need to continue doing what we've been doing: distributing
technology, experimenting with remailers, and increasing awareness.
Not taking the government on with no tools, no experience, and no
clue.
