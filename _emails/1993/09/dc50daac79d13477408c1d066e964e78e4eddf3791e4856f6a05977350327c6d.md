  >What is your policy on chaining to anon.penet.fi?

Hmmm, it would be bad to post to anon.penet.fi through a remailer, as the
anon id assigned by penet would be associated with the remailer, _not_ with
you.  Therefore, people who responded to the message would actually be
sending mail to the operator of the remailer that was the hop into penet. 
Not to mention the fact if the remailer account were also a personal
account, and the operator was a client of penet, that his anon id could be
compromised in this way (if he was foolish enough not to have a password).

Therefore, it seems reasonable that remailers should refuse to mail into
penet, unless and until a non-anonymous reply to anonymous mail facility
becomes available there.

To the penet knowledgeable: is my understanding correct?
