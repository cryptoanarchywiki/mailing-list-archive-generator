        This admonition rings a bell in my mind. Most of the US export laws 
seem to be based on "export outside US or Canada". So I'm wondering, are the 
comparable Canadian laws as strict about export of crypto software? 
Specifically, if US authorities won't stop us from exporting to Canada (placing 
files on Canadian FTP sites), will Canadian authorities stop us from exporting 
to Europe, et al. (foreign users FTPing the files from the deposit site)?
        Yes, it's a longshot. No, I don't have all the facts. Yes, I will 
probably get enough "clueless newbie" flames to set my Ethernet card on fire. I 
know all of these things. Could someone please answer the question?
