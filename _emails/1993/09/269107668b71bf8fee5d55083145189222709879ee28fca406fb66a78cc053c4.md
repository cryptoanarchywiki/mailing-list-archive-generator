Ok...Police = TO PROTECT AND SERVE.

	To protect us from ourselves....self-righteous fucks decide what
	to protect us from...with little or no democratic feedback

	To serve...a long hard disease ridden penis with no condom
	much less lubrication.. in the butt...part of the S & M
	appeal of control and authority...
