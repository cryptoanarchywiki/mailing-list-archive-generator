If someone does write this letter, please don't represent the Cypherpunks 
list as being entirely composed of libertarians or (in Perry's words)
"capitalist anarchists", whatever those might be. It seems counterproductive 
to me to enter into extended political debates here on the list, so I don't 
- but it's a mistake to assume that silence, in this case, constitutes 
agreement or consensus about deeper political issues. I think it'd be more 
accurate to represent the C-punks list as a group of folks with divergent 
political viewpoints who agree on the importance of personal privacy and see 
technology as a potential vehicle for acheiving or maintaining it.
