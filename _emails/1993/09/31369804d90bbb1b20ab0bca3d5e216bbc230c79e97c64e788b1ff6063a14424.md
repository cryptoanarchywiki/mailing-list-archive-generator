Congratulations to S. McCandlish, a longtime BBS operator, cypherpunk
loyalist and PGP promoter, who, if nobody else noticed, just won the
coveted Online Activist position advertised by EFF some weeks ago. He
has plans to put together an EFF BBS and archive on a fast machine with
Internet connectivity. He'll be moving to Washington D.C. by October
and running his previous BBS from there.  Hope to hear more from him
here on his progress! Maybe he can sneak a few subversive cypherpunk
rants onto the archive! :)
