C-Shroud does nothing with zero-knowledge proofs, or anything nearly
that sophisticated.  It simply mungs identifiers, strips comments and
whitespace, and things of that sort.  The idea is to get the machine
independence (heh) of C, with the unreadability (heh) of object code.
It can't really be that hard to read -- after all, most of the
human-work in disassembly is precisely the job of analyzing an
uncommented HLL program with meaningless identifiers.
