Most of them are scared to death over possible liability, like if someone
is selling credit card numbers and using their BBS to forward the messages,
they feel they could be legally liable.  There have been too many instances
of folks getting their computers confiscated over this sort of thing.

Personally, I feel like it's all a scam, cooked up by those in the DA's
office who are jealous because ours are bigger than theirs are.  ;)  A 486/50
with a couple of GB HD and a SVGA monitor and a couple of 1.4K modems is a
pretty hard thing to pass up if you're short on computing power in the DA's
office ... and short on $$$...  :(
