    . . . What could be done have the computer screw up the
    cop's data days, weeks or months after the seizure?  Of
    course, I would never do such a thing myself, nor would
    I advise anyone else to do so.  I do, however, have a
    passing academic interest in the subject.  Same for you
    folks too, right?

Perry responded:

    Why wouldn't you? Its your machine, so what you do to it
    is perfectly legal. You are under no obligation to make
    your equipment suitable for people who wish to steal it.

Well duh, Perry.  Let me rephrase that:

    . . . nor would I advise anyone else to do so.  I do,
    however, have a passing academic interest in the
    subject.  Same for you folks too, right?

              (smiley face for the humor impaired)


But all seriousness aside, Perry also offers a suggestion about
altering the ROMs on the disk controllers and then using a
special operating system.  Sounds like a terrific idea.  Just how
hard is this to do?  How about somebody writing a how-to manual
for this?

Or maybe all we need is a sticker that says:

                           !!WARNING!!
                  This Machine is Booby-Trapped
                      Use at Your Own Risk
