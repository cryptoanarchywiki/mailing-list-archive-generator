Steve,

Assuming that whoevever implemented PGP did not himself import the cipher, but
based the implementation on the EUROCRYPT '90 paper that was 'imported'
by Springer-Verlag, I don't understand what the basis would be for such a
charge.  Now an indictment against Springer for shipping the proceedings
(which contained C source code for IDEA) into the US - that would be
interesting...
