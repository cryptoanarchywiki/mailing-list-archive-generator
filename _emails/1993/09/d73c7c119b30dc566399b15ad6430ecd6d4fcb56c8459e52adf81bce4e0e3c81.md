IMNSHO, whether they're inseperable or not, harping on anarchy is like
advocating strong crypto so that terrorists can use it, ignoring all
legitimate uses.  It's the talk which plays into FBI hands, not the
reality.  The reality is here and can not be avoided but reality can't be
cited in PR campaigns the way talk can.

I know that drug dealers, terrorists and child molestors will use strong
crypto.  That doesn't mean that I cite such uses when I write letters to
Congress or to magazine editors.  I cite legitimate uses which the general
public will applaud -- not the abberant uses which can not be avoided, no
matter how draconian the legislation against crypto.

It might be satisfying to point out to the government that they can't stop
anarchists and criminals from using crypto but IMHO that would merely
(1) anger them and (2) give them ammo for denying ligitimate users
access to crypto.  It might even be that that's what they want all along
-- let the criminals have it and deny it to you and me.  That way criminals
identify themselves by passing random-looking bits between them.

Have a nice day.
