Another good argument in favor of anonymous credentials...

A person of my acquaintance who was long ago "seduced by the dark side of 
the Force" tells me that there is a lucrative market in ID copies supplied 
by people working in the personnel departments of companies.  When new 
employees come with their birth certificates, SSN cards, driver's 
licenses, etc and their completed I-9 forms as required by the '86 
Immigration Act, the clerk will take them to the copy machine, hit the 
button twice, pocket the extra set of copies, sell the ID package to a 
credit borrower or ID craftsman.  All sorts of juicy info is there in one 
place.  It's great.

Who will fool them all one day (and make the former Prince jealous) by 
changing his name to ASCII 7 so that bells will ring whenever a database 
accesses it.
