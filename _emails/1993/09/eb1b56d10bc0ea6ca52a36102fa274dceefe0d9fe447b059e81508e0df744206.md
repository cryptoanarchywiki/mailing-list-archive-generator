I think it's really important that if you're looking to shock your audience
that you also show a glimpse of not only the "light at the end of the
tunnel" but also a glimpse of the reasons that people would be better off
making a dash for the end of the tunnel than trying to run back to the
tunnel's start.  Otherwise, you're just fueling the anxieties of countless
luddites and techonophobes.

I hardly speak for all of the cypherpunks, of course, but generally we work
the "Big Brother" side of the street.  There are others who are more on top
of this sort of thing.  Judyc@well might be a good resource for this sort of
thing.
