From a high-level source in contact with an *extremely* high level source:

Rumor: Moby Crypto was targeted because G. Ward intended to include PGP
on distribution disks. The investigation is primarily PGP oriented, and
G. Ward is just a bystander who got caught up. PRZ & PGP is the essential target.

Notes

(1)  phrasing of the subpoenas definitely confirms this -- PGP is mentioned in both.

(2) can we find any Usenet postings where G. Ward announced intent to
distribute PGP with Moby Crypto to help confirm this?

(3) Current Underground Digest just came out -- it (contrarily) hypes
the Moby Crypto `attack' as foremost, and *mislabels* PRZ's comments as
`reaction to Moby Crypto attack' -- in fact, there is no indication
that he knew of Moby Crypto when he wrote those.
