Sandy,
 
  There are a number of ways in which you can set up *your* machine
to self-destruct.  The best way to accomplish this is through
Perry's suggestion of a regular security check to which you must
reply or the PILL is activated.
 
  If all you are concerned about is private mail or the like, a
simple batch wipe file would work (hide the wipe program).  Putting
any prompt at boot and turning off obvious ways of defeating *your*
security will help.
 
  Not to start everyone flaming, but there is nothing wrong with
destroying your own computer thru infamous combinations of
interrupt hooks and the like (was that cryptic enough to avoid
a virii flame?)
