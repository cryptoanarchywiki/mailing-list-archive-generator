At CFP (or maybe it was an event at Modern Times in SF just before CFP...) I
remember some people talking about this fidonet pickiness.  There is also a
large number of fido sites that DO pass encrypted traffic.  They have their
own "backbone" for encrypted traffic, too.

I think that Tom Jennings was one of the people who was talking about
this...which makes perfect sense, since I think he started fidonet...
