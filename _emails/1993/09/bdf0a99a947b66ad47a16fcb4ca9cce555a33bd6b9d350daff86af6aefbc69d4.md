It's all very well to be able to crack DES in 3.5 hours, but I don't know
of too many people who obligingly send out the plaintext and cyphertext of
a message together, or in some other way combinable.  If U can get the
plaintext of a DES-encrypted msg then U don't need to dick around with DES
anyway.  No-one ever said it was bulletproof; a direct consequence is that
DES users change their keys awful frequently.
