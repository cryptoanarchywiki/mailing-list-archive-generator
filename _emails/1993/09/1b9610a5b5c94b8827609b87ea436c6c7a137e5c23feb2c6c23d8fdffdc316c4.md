## Raw message

```
{% raw  %}From: remailer@netcom.com
Date: Thu, 2 Sep 93 05:46:54 PDT
To: cypherpunks@toad.com
Subject: new remailer
Message-ID: <9309021239.AA15429@mail.netcom.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain


Well not _that_ new.  I've been operating it since Sunday.

I am operating this remailer out of my personal account.

It's interface is identical to the standard cypherpunks remailer as defined
by the code I ftp'd from soda.berkeley.edu.  I've modified the code to fit
it to my particular administrative situation, so you should consider this
remailer EXPERIMENTAL.

Remailer Address: catalyst@netcom.com

Any message that has a header line of the form

        Request-Remailing-To: somebody@somewhere

-- either in the header or with the header pasting operator (::) -- will
get remailer handling.  If a message does _not_ include any remailer
commands, then it must actually be a message to catalyst@netcom.com (me). 
The message will subsequently be delivered to me.

Note: badly-formed remailer commands may be equivalent to _no_ commands at
all, and thus your message will be delivered to me, instead of getting
remailed!  I WARNED YOU.
