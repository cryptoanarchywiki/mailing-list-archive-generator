 You're right, Eric -- we are mad as hell, too. But I'm not about to
 jump on a flight to the west coast to simply share strategies. The
 fact that I would even consider it negates the functions which we are
 working towards, no? I propose that us east coasters organize and
 meet as well. Pat and I are DC bourne, for those interested, I'd like
 to propose a DC local meeting. Suggestions? Keep in mind that I'm in
 NYC during the week, so my only available meeting times aare on the
 weekends. (By the way, lets get our shit together DC'ers. We need
 technologists, not lacidaisical idealisms.)
 
 Your DC based Cypherpunk group is hereby established. BTW, if anyone
 noticed, the EFF is drawing some serious fire by the public press.
 "Sold out to commercialism", one headline reads.
 
 Cheers.
