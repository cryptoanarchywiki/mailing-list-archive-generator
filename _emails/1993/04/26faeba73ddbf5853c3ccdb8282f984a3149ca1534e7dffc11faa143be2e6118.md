I suspect the Clipper chip will be used heavily in digital cellular phones,
if it isn't too much of a power hog.

I seriously doubt it. I could easily have done DES in software on our
CDMA digital cellphones using spare cycles in the CPU we already have
(a '186) had I been allowed to do so.  Why should I re-engineer my
already designed products to use a $30 IC instead?  Power is not the
only issue.
