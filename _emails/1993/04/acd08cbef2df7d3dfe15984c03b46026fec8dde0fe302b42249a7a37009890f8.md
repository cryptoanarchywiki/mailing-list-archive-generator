## Raw message

I suggest that as a first step in the process of making alt.whistleblowers
a reality, that we kick around the idea for a while, either here
or on alt.config.  If I receive a positive response, I will
post the control message myself.  

Three possible choices of action:
1) Kick it around on alt.config.
2) Kick it around on news.groups, etc.
3) Kick it around here.
4) Don't even bother kicking it around; just create the group,
   and hell with anyone who doesn't like it.

So, what's the general consensus on the best course of action?
And, yes, I know that was four, and not three possible choices;
it's probably really eight or ten.
