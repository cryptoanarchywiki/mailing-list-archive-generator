Eric mentioned boycotting AT&T products produced at facilities
in Greensboro.

I did a quick search of AT&T Greensboor for the last years,
looking through trade and tech pubs.

Basically their is mention of their Federal Systems group
and there Federal systems advanced technologies group.

They have a AT&T Proposal center there and a business called
AT&T Technical Service Co.

Bell Labs/Federal Systems group runs the Guilford Center complex
there.

They annouced they are building a 5 Million dollar plant for
building telecommunications products for the US Gov. and for
the International Commerical Markets. (This was within this
years, and may or may not have been, at that time, a cover
to hide what ever facilities were being built for the WireTap
Chip project.

It should be noted that Public Key Partners is located in
Greensboro. That the AT&T deal with them at the time, was
probally completed so that the WireTap phone systems AT&T
will sell will not violate RSA/PKP patents.
