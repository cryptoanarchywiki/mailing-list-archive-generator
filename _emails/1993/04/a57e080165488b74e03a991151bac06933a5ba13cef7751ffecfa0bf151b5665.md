At this time, there is no reason not to assume that every LE agency will
have access to the family key.

In the future there is every reason to expect that all LE agencies will
develope a pressing need for family key(s) and decrypto equiptment.

In the past in Nazi Germany, this sort of traffic analysis applied to
telephone call records allowed the LE agencies to round up cells of
resistance.  To this day, such records are not kept in Germany.
