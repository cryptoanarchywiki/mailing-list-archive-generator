Phil, there is more to this than meets the eye.  What happens if I, as
an attacker, start feeding extra characters onto the modem line?
Granted, I wont know what you are saying, since the link is encrypted,
but if I can get an extra character on there, then the decryption will
lose sync, and wont return the proper value...

For example...
	Sender:  	more foo
	Encrypted data:	HaoVwAog

	Received data:	HaooVwAog
	Decrypted:	morOmf&sm

Now what?  The sender and receiver are out of sync....  I believe this
was what Nickey was talking about..  I was discussing this problem
with a few people and haven't come up with a good, viable solution...
yet.

Uhh, there is a kstream package somewhere (or am I thinking of
vapor-ware, it's late and I'm tried).  This wouldn't be very hard to
create.  In fact, I was hoping to do something like this with my
Thesis...  Although it might get left for "future work".  This depends
upon having a clearly denoted stream, which neither telnet nor kermit
provide a good interface.  (Trust me on this -- it took me a while to
try to create one for the little I've hacked them for my Thesis).
