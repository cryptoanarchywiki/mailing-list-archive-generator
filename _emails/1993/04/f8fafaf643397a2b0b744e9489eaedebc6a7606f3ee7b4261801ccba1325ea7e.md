Hey, no problem!

Just use the same escape call as the uucp pathalias.

When integrating an Internet/DNS aware gateway with 1200 Unix workstations
using /etc/hosts (no domain) and an X.400 connection to a VMS X.400 backbone,
I hooked in a little C program that converted all the addressing to proper
formats while also looking up userid's <-> fullnames in a B+tree database.
I even did fuzzy matching on names on a best-unique or exact basis.

Blew away X.500 functionality, which Dec and HP didn't even have integrated
with X.400 at the time.

Just need a program that takes an address on the command line and returns
it possibly modified with a yey or ney return code.
