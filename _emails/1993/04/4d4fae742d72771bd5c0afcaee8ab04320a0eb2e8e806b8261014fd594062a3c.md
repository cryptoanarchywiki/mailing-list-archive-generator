Speaking as the ftp site maintainer, I'm looking for all the press
coverage there is on this wiretap chip, both national and local
coverage.  I've seen quotes from several other sources, but not whole
articles.  So type in what's at hand and send it to me.  I'll put it
up for ftp.

I've got Saturday's article from the SF Chronicle here, which I
haven't yet typed in, but I should warn you that this piece is one of
the most slanted things I've seen in that paper.  (Those of you who've
read the Chron know this is a real insult.)  I'll get it typed in
myself unless someone can send me a copy.

Eric
