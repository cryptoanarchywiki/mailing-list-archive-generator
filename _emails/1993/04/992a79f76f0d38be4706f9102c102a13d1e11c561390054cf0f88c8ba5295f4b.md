Since I've been using encrypted mail for about a month, now, I've developed a
few usefull batch files and telix script files.  Would anyone be interested in
having them.  For the most part, they're pretty simple, but I use them, and 
they work. ;^)  

I don't use the perl scripts that came with pgp since I don't trust the phone
connection.  I xfer encrypted messages and read them at home.  BTW, I use 4dos
version 4.02 as opposed to command.com as my command interpreter; some of my 
batch files require features that 4dos has that msdos does not.  Anyway, 4dos
is a much better package than straight pms-dos.

I think we need to develope methods to make encryption as simple to use as 
possible.  Is this something that you all are interested in or am I just blowing
smoke? ;^)
