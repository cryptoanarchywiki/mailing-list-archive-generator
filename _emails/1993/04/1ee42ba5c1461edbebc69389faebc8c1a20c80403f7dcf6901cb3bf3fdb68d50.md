This is true. But if a sampling rate of about 9000-10,000 samples per second
are used this will allow for good voice quality and the encryption algorithm 
should be able to handle it. The IDEA implementations I have seen for the
Amiga run about 30-50K per second on my Amiga 1200 with 68020. This should
be fast enough. If you then can send that data directly to the serial port
with a fast modem 14.4K it should work. But it might sound choppy (haven't
done the figures yet on how much data would be going to the modem while
the person speaks, but it may be substantial enough to make the use of
a high speed modem not feasible. Also I have to consider that data compression
in the form of LAP/M or MNP will be ineffective against the encrypted data
as it will appear as white noise and will be largely uncompressable..
