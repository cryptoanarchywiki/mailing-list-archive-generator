In message <9303290017.AA05745@toad.com> you write:

>perfect prelude to blackmail.  An unscrupulous person running a

That's why you use more than one remailer and you encrypt the messages.
This guards against single-point failures...  

>Always encrypting helps with mail, but not with news.

Why?  One layer of encription is stripped by each remailer.  Use
three layers of encription and three remailers: The first remailer
will know that you sent something encripted; the third will see the
message and the destination but not know that you were the author.
