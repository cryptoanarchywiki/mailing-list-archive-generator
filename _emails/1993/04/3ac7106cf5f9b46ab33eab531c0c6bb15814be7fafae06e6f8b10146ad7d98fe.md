Removing the headers from PGP will accomplish only the most cursory
security.  The PGP packet structure is recognizable out of a random
byte stream even without the headers.

More generally, just because _you_ don't know how to recognize
something doesn't mean your opponent is similarly lacking.  In order
to really know it can't be done, you need a proof, that is, an
argument that covers all possible ways of looking for something.

This principle applies to all forms of steganography.

I think work done to get PGP, for example, in mail readers is
something that should be done with a bit more zeal.  I, personally,
don't use it much because of my computing environment (receiving mail
on a widely-known-to-be-insecure Unix box, dialed in from MSDOS).  The
integration problems are pressing.

True up to a point.  Remember, internet users are still a small
percentage of the whole.
