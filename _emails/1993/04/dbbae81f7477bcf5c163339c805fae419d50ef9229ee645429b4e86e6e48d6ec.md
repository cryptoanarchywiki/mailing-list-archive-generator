    ok well i am sure that there are a lot of people out there that want to learn 
    how to do basic cypher/decyphering... so i think it would be nice if people 
    gave their knowledge on how to do decryption... even if its very very basic
    and perhaps a faq could be made out of this info...

sci.crypt has recently put out a FAQ (at last).  I forget where it's
ftp-able from but there's always someone on sci.crypt asking where the
FAQ is, and it gets reposted from time to time.

There are lots of ways to encrypt/decrypt/cryptanalyze.  The sci.crypt
FAQ lists some books on the subject.  Would-be cryptanalysts could take
a look at Abraham Sinkov's "Elementary Cryptanalysis, A Mathematical
Approach", published by The Mathematical Association of America, 1966.
