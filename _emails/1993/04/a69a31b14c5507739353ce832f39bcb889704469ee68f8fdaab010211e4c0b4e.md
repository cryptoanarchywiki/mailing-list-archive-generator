I like the newer sound bites.

``Having to deposit copies of all your private letters with the
authorities, "in case" they need to later read them...''

and

``Giving the government keys to your encrypted messages is like giving
 them keys to the front door of your house.''

seem best.

Phil,  About the right to bear arms and crypto-privacy...you are
right--it is not a good sound bite for J. Q. Public, but could be a 
good angle for *understanding* (uhg, I hate this sound bite stuff.)
