Re MycoToxin: contact the Covert Action Information Bulletin and ask if they
have anything on anyone named in connection with MycoToxin.  Do the same
with other think-tanks that deal in defense-related issues, for example the
Center for National Security Studies or some such.  

TRW is a scary thought indeed; and of course these people don't ever cut
their ties for good... consider that TRW is a huge NSA partner and also
maintains the Great Big Database of all our credit records & buying habits.
 Bad combinations, getting worse by the minute.
