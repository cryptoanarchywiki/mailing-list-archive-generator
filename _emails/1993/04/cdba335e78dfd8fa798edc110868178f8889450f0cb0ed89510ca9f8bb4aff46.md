A couple of things:

- I was reading mail to post my announcement, when I read yours :-)

- I'm more than willing to defer to the majority, though I think there's 
something to be said for networking the meetings, especially if we have good 
tools. I've also already received a great deal of response to the idea of a 
Saturday meeting, even from out-of-towners. To that end, I'm going to post an 
announcement for a Saturday meeting, and see what happens. Several of us have 
been planning it for a couple of days now, so don't take it personally or 
anything. 

- Paul Ferguson and a couple of others and I have been cobbling together a 
list of people we thought would be interested in meeting in the DC area, so 
as to do preliminary planning without polluting Cypherpunks too much. I can 
see that there are more DC area people than I had originally envisioned, 
which makes me happy. Sorry if we missed you originally.
 
- Eric and I have discussed the idea of audio teleconferencing the various 
meetings, either via the Internet or by phone. I've got both a Sun IPC 
equipped to do the former, and a Western Electric conference telephone (and 6-
way on my switch) for the latter. 

Well readers, which do you prefer?
