 I think that you guys are missing the point here. IMHO, if you wish
 maximum assurance of security, than I'd suggest not trying to run
 programs such as PGP on a multi-user system to begin with! What's
 wrong with using a PC for this? It offfers a maximum convenience,
 single-user secure system quite unlike the security problems
 associated with your university's mainframe.
 
 The PC offers the communications availability and the flexibilty to
 provide an extremely high level of privacy, if you know what you're
 doing.
 
 You should try it sometime ....
 
 Cheers.
