     Now this is an idea I like... what about using the 
antitheft-metal base tags that leave a surface impression
when removed... it currently leaves a checkboard pattern but
that could be reworked to say INSECURE , or TAPPED... 
then post then on every ATT instrument around... including payphones
 the front of the label could make reference to CLIPPER and give a
voicemail number to call for further info... yippie indeed...


    cheers
