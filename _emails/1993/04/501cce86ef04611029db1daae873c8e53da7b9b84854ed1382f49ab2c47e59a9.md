I thank Marc Ringuette and Phil Karn for their comments on public
kiosks.  They remind me that public kiosks are not a panacea, and that
we need to educate others to that awareness.

Nevertheless, let us remember the econmonics of the situation.  It is
expensive to follow people around--more expensive, say, than an
illegal tap on a home phone line.  By increasing the cost of the
suppression of information, one ensures that more information, in the
aggregate, is released.

We may not be able to provide for any particular individual's privacy,
but we can take actions for which we know that we will increase the
total amount of privacy (however hard that would be to strictly
define).

Eric
