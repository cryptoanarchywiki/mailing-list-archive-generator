Last year Oxford press published a book called

	The Invisible Weapon - it details, from 1851 - 1945,
how governments, esp. the British have used "backdoors" into
coded messages to watch/listen/read messages.

At one time the British has a strangle hold on world wide telegram
service. They made very strong claims that they would never read
their clients (often other governments) mail, but instead went
to detailed and expensive measures to insure that in fact they
could/did.

The IBSN # is :0-19-506273-6

We should read this book (I have) so in the up coming debate on
the Clipper, we can frame the Clipper in the rich historical context
it deserves to be placed in.
