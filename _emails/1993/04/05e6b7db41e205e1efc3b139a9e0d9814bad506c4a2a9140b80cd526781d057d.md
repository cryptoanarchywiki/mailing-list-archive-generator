According to a front page article in today's New York Times, the
Clinton Administration is going to be releasing a standard encryption
technology that commercial users will be encouraged to adopt that
involves having the government keep copies of "back door" keys
associated with every device deployed. The article is entitled,
with unintentional irony, "Communications Plan to Balance Government
Access with Privacy". The article indicates that the move is "inteded
to resolve a long standing dilema[...] how to preserve the legitimate
right for businesses and citizens to use codes [...] without letting
criminals and terrorists conspire beyond the reach of the law".

The implications are obvious.
