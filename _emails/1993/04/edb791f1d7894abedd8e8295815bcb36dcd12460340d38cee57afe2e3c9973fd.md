} As I understand RIPEM there is a tree of agencies such that everyone
} must trust all elements of the tree between him and the root.

I just want to point out (as has been pointed out before) that it is a 
mistake to confuse RIPEM with PEM. 

RIPEM is an implementation of a subset of PEM. At this moment, RIPEM has
absolutely no support for certificates or signed public keys.

PEM on the other hand, is a draft internet standard which requires
certificates and a hierarchy that can be described as a "Tree of Trust".

There are at least a couple of full PEM implementations. Probably
the best known at this point is the one from T.I.S. which is currently
in beta test.

Apologies in advance for cluttering the mailboxes of the majority
of cypherpunks who already know this.

Mark
