>>> "4. Educating the Public."

I've seen several public/private debates open up just from "grass roots"
circulation of the announcements and such.  My only concerns are that:

a)  It's all pretty unfocused.
b)  It's being circulated on mailing lists (et al) where the discussion is
inappropriate and probably would be viewed as annoying.

But then again, any topic discussed on the network seems to have these problems 
initially.
