Though these missives were much longer than I'd like, they were
extremely interesting, with good points on each side....

...I seem to come down more on Tim's since "cypherpunks" is just a
mailing list, and I just can't get scared or insulted by ASCII no matter
how hard I try.  And the name might wakeup an sleepy reader in a print
article.

In person (Perry's argument) a mailing list doesn't/can't have a
reprentative, else Dotty could subscribe and pass herself off as a
list member/representative.   Actually, people just represent themselves,
and have to be aware of how effective a presenter of their message
they are no matter what they are doing.
