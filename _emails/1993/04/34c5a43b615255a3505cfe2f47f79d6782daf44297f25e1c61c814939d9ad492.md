I have worked with the NCSC (National Computer Security Center)
on certifying operating systems according to the "Orange Book".
 
As I understand RIPEM there is a tree of agencies such that everyone
must trust all elements of the tree between him and the root.
This is much ingrained in all of the legally mandated security
systems that I am aware of. It assumes, at first glance, that there
is a root, an inner sanctum, which is totally trusted by all.
 
The Orange Book for operating system security has such assumptions
embedded deeply. We had to essentially weeken our security features
by disableing our "mutually supicious user" logic to meet their
requirements.

It is a pervasive mind-set in military security.
