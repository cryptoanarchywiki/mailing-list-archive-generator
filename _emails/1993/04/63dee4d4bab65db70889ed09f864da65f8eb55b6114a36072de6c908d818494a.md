Harry Shapiro mentions what sounds like an excellent little book,
titled "The Invisible Weapon"

I've made a directory called clipper/ in the ftp site.  I'm looking
for information to fill it up with.

Harry, I'd like to publicly ask you to write an annotated bibliography
entry for this book so that I could put it up.  Full reference
details, of course, two or three sentences describing the contents of
each chapter, and a small summary.  Thanks in advance.

If anyone has an electronic copy of the New York Times article, please
send it in.

Please send all your submissions via email, as I don't have the
necessary permissions to use the incoming directory on soda.

Send submissions to hughes@soda.berkeley.edu.
Download stuff from soda.berkeley.edu:pub/cypherpunks via anon ftp.

Eric
