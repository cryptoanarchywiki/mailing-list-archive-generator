Well, I'm not too sure what this has to do with cypherpunking, but here goes:

The difference between Software Engineering and Computer Science is sort
of like the difference between Differential Equations and Mathematics. 
SoftEng is a subset of CompSci.  I don't believe there are any schools
that offer SoftEng as a BS degree - very few schools even offer an
undergrad-level SoftEng course, Carnegie Mellon University (we're ranked
second in CompSci overall) being a notable exception.  We offer a
Masters degree in SoftEng, and even have a program set up that allows a
student to achieve a BS in CompSci and a MS in SoftEng in five years. 
[However, squeezing both those degree programs into a 5-year period
would probably kill most ordinary mortals.  I don't recommend this
program, as lots of people have a hard time fitting the BS into
four-and-a-half :) years.  We're a tough school...]

Not a University Spokescritter, but I play one on the net,
