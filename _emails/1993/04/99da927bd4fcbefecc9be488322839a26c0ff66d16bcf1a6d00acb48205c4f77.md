Paul Rubin is going to demonstrate some of the voice coders he's been
working on at the meeting Saturday, hardware willing.

As far as soundblaster cards, I would recommend instead something like
a bigmouth board, which already has the phone line access and handset
on it.

Secure phones will be a large topic Saturday, since that's where the
first deployment of the wiretap chip will be.

Eric
