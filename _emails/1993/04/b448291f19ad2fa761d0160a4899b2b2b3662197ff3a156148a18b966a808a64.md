This is the ideal scenario.  I suspect that kiosks for other purposes
will eventually contain some form of user-available I/O.  I'm guessing
it will be infrared, maybe rs232 serial.  Diskette drives are too
vulnerable and expensive to be feasible in a pay phone environment;
they're called armor phones, and for good reason.  In particular,
sfnet doesn't have diskette access.

No bother, we're not going to create the best system on the first
revision.  A good enough system will drive later systems.

Eric
