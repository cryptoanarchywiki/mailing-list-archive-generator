: T[i] is generated by a pseudo random process, similar to shuffling a deck of
: cards.  For each i, fill the vector with the values 0 to D-1.  Then two random
: indexes (j & k) are chosen (to be different) and the two values at
: T[i,j] and T[i,k] are swapped.  This can be iterated an arbitraty number of
: times (L) to ensure a good "shuffle" of the values.

I saw this particularly clueless statement and stopped even trying to follow
the rest of it.  Still, I made an even more stupid blunder on sci.crypt a few
weeks ago myself, so I can't criticise.  All I can say is I learned from my
mistake and will leave thinking up new crypto schemes to the experts.
