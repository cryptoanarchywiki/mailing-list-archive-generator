There are two security items here.  The first is that the secret RSA
key nott be revealed.  The second is that the name attached to that
key pair not be revealed.

This protection applies to the first criterion--your secret key is not
revealed.  No one can steal your key and impersonate you.

The second datum, name attached to a key, is protected only by one's
sole possession of the secring.pgp file.  If you are using a
pseudonym, and using an RSA signature to enforce it, and doing thing
with this pseudonym that you don't want identified with you, then
you'd better make sure that secring.pgp file is not discovered on your
machine.  The format of the keyring file is such that the name
attached to a key is in the clear.

This is really a huge hole.  Since secret keys are presumed to be in
the possession of only those who actually use the keys, possession of
a secret key on the secring.pgp is tantamount to proof that you are
that pseudonym.

In short: everything about a secret key ring should be encrypted.

A parallel (not as consequential): everything about a public key ring
should be encrypted.
