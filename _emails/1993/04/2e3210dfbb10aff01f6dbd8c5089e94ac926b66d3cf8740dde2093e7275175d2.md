I agree. Mentioning guns raises too many confusing issues, including
emotional reactions, talk of private vs. public ownership, etc. Several
decades ago it might have been better received.

The compelling "sound bites" revolve around these kinds of examples:

- having to deposit copies of all your private letters with the
authorities, "in case" they need to later read them...

- not being allowed to use locks--on anything--that the government can't bypass

- recording all private conversations and escrowing the tapes, just in case
the government later wants to hear them

- video cameras in all bedrooms to allow the police to check for illegal
activities (even with proper "court orders," most people will react with
shock at this suggestion)

These are things that everyone can understand. And be shocked by. When they
realize just how similar the "key escrow" idea is to these examples, they
may get more indignant.
