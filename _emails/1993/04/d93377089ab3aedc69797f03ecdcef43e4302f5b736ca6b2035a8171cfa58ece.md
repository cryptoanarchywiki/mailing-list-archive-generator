I am sending this here _prior_ to posting it to give advance
warning; responses received have varied on the methods of
creation of the group, but have largely tended toward a consensus
that it is wise to have some sort of discussion period; in
addition, I have chosen a cross-post to those groups most likely
to have an interest in creating the group, and if this results
in a flamewar in alt.config, so be it.  After I tally the votes
and they vastly outnumber the NOs I will create the newsgroup
without further delay.  I just wish for people to clarify; sorry
if you missed it, but this is going out in four hours exactly to
the aforementioned newsgroups.  I will implement all important
suggestions mailed to me by that time, including alteration of
procedural points, wording changes, alteration of Newsgroups:
line, etc.  I will also delay posting if valid and immediate
concerns are brought to light; however, since I leave the 
major axes:  Moderated or unmoderated, length of discussion
period, length of voting period, open for discussion, it should
not be a disaster if it goes out in its current form.  Join
the discussion, and if you like the idea, PLEASE send a YES
vote only WHEN the Call for Votes is posted.

Additionally, suggestions for additions/deletions of Newsgroups
from the crosspost, or a more appropriate place to
redirect replies, or any suggestions whatever will be adopted
if suitable.

If you have no interest in the privacy issue, please type 'd' now.

Followup-to: alt.config
Subject: Call for discussion: alt.whistleblower

In light of the current debate concerning whether anonymous posting
can serve a useful purpose, I propose the immediate experiment of creating
a group which shall provide a genuinely useful service to the
public.  

This newsgroup is to be called alt.whistleblower, and is for the purpose
of allowing those who might otherwise be unwilling to come forward to
provide information about the illegal activities of government
agencies, large corporations and similar malefactors without fear
of illegal reprisals against them.

The need for this group is evident in light of the extreme usefulness
of information concerning the behavior of the governing bodies of
the United States, and the large number of government employees and
corporate employees with access to the Internet and anonymous posting
services.

This group could also include reports of illegal discrimination
by those who fear reprisal if they reveal their names, information
concerning safety issues by those who know that their company is
releasing an unsafe or dangerous product, or defrauding customers
by dishonest and illegal means.

Considering the immediate need for this newsgroup in light of
those who, in many cases, provide services for a fee and then
provide an inadequate service by cutting their downstream sites
from reading anything that the service-provider deems is inappropriate,
I request a waiver of procedure in this matter and that, if significant
interest is present and seems to form a general consensus, it shall
be accepted that I revise and present a prospectus for this newsgroup 
and a call for votes on a date no sooner than seven days from
this initial posting and no later than ten days after the call
for discussion.  Procedural points concerning the length of the
voting period are to be addressed in the public discussion, and
anyone wishing to send anonymous mail should forward it to me.

This newsgroup is necessary and of great potential
use, as those of you with a legitimate need for privacy
know well.  If you value your privacy, let us discuss this
wisely and equitably in order to reach a consensus.   

Whether this newsgroup is to be moderated or unmoderated,
whether the name is appropriate or another hierarchy would
be preferable, and all procedural points are to be decided
based on the general consensus.

I realize there will be those who will oppose the creation
of this newsgroup on the oft-cited grounds that "Anyone who
needs privacy must be hiding something."

This is true; however, in our society there are many things
which need to be revealed as well as many things which need
to be concealed.

I believe that a corollary truism could be applied to those
who oppose the notion of public privacy.  "Anyone who
fears privacy must be hiding something."

Let the discussion begin.

Final note:  Do NOT, repeat, NOT send votes until I post
a "Call for Votes" at the end of the discussion period.  The
length of the discussion period may be increased if some
drastic occurrence requires it, but I'm planning to post
it in one week.  Vote then.  I thank you for your consideration
in this matter.
