Some posters have speculated that it might be possible to get
a phone, swap it with someone else, and then the feds would not
be able to get the correct key-pair.

An other poster assumed that each clipper chip would send out some
sort of Clipper-ID in plain-text before and/or during and/or after
a session.

Which causes me to further speculate that it may be possible to filter
out these plain text messages. (They are probally built in to the
exchange of keys ritual and so can't be filtered out without
preventing the Clipper to do it thing...).

If they can be filter, filtering them may either be an out right
criminal act or be considered probally cause for a warrent to determine
why you are filtering them out, etc.
