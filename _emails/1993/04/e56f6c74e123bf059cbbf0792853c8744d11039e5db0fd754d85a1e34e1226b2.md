	This seems to be an EXCELLENT idea. I wholeheartedly think that
every cypherpunk with a strong knowledge of crypto (I haven't a
strong knowledge yet-- still a newbie) contact the local press and offer
your services as a local crypto-expert.
	I think that I probably know 10-15 times more than the general
public about crypto, and it also seems that most of the people on this
list know about 10-15 times more about crypto than myself. Thus there's
a HUGE gulf of knowledge which must be remedied.
