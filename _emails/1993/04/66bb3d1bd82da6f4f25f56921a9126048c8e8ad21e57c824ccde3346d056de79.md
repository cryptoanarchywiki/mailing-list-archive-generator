 I'm putting together of interested parties who would like to get
 together for physical meetings on a "psuedo-random" basis. As Pat
 mentioned earlier, my free time is non-existant at least until
 mid-May (getting re-married May 1), but I'm eager to meet, unite
 and build a DC chapter.
 
 Solidarity and determination, my brothers and sisters!
 
 Also, send your pubkey. Little things mean alot.
