I have been 'introducing' my friends to PGP too... I figure that its no
good if I have a key, but no one to use it with...  :-)  Its amazing how
many people will take the time to play with an interesting new toy...

I'm not too sure here... but PGP should default to using the newest
(youngest) key on you private key ring...  If you have two of them with
the same name, I'm not sure how you could choose other than the first... 
The trick here might be to a a key size option to PGP, to say I want the
key that is (or is at least) n bits in size.

I'll not get into computer wars...  I'll just say that I'll take an Amiga
over an IBM clone any day!  >;-)  As far as I can tell.. there are folx
out there that make sure the Amiga version goes public pretty soon after a
new version is released...  I've hade 2.2 since about 3 days after I knew
it was released...  There are a series on AmiNet "mirrors" all over the
world, the one that most IBM'ers would recognize right off being
wuarchive.wustle.edu (128.252.135.4) in /pub/aminet/util/crypt.

I have some options on some of your ideas, but I'll save them for another
post at another time..  :-)
