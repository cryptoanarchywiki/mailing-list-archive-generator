One of the necessities of a truly effect whistleblowing system is the
existence of public kiosks where anybody can post from--the equivalent
of public telephones for the net.  This is useful when the sending of
any encrypted message at all will be grounds for reprisal.  (It is, of
course, useful for paranoids as well...)

Last night I spoke with Wayne Gregori, who runs a system called sfnet
(with some variant of capitalization) here in the Bay Area.  sfnet is
a coffeehouse network, with public terminals located in various
locations in SF, Berkeley, Oakland, etc.  There is the equivalent of
IRC and private mail for the users, almost all of whom use handles.
there is also dialup service available.

sfnet just got their internet hookup.  It's not integrated into the
rest of the software yet; that is being worked on.

Wayne is supportive of the idea of putting a whistleblowers interface
into the sfnet public terminals.

New slogan: Drop the dirty quarter!
