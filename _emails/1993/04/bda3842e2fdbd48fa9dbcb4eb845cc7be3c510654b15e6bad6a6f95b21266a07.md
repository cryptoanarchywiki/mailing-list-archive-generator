If you don't vote, your opinion literally doesn't count, and means that
you are perfectly happy with the status quo. Not voting guarantees that 
you will have no voice.  Perot's name will be remembered a lot longer 
than some nuts whining how about the process doesn't work. The best way 
to protest the current system, is to vote for something else. 

I'm a Libertarian rather than a Perotian, but I give him a lot of credit 
for allowing so many people to see beyond the two party system. 

Vote with your feet, not with your butt.
