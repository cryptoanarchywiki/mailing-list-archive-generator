I am forced to agree with you here..... I dont think we have
the "juice" to carry off a maximum effort at this point...
I would gladly volunteer to setup such a site AND I would
need a peacenet feed instead of the "gratis" connections
I obtain from netcom.... I AM already uncoercible... as
you well know and I would need you as well as others in backing
on this effort...OK kids... Here we have one volunteer if we can get 
at least 3 other sites(my mininum buyin is 4 US sites)....
Hey John... what about you???
      cheers
      kelly
p.s. I would be willing to maintain a PAX type anon operation
as well as an anon-remailer.....and a KEY server...
 would also offer the PGP archives via mail server...
note that I am uucp connected and would need to upgrade
to 56 kb leased or V-FAST technology...
