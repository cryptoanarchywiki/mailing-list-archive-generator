Actually, *I* unilaterally changed it.  The climate is different
here in England.  "UK Cryptoprivacy Association" works;
"Cypherpunks" requires time-consuming explanation.  Of course, I
_like_ the latter term... ;-)

In any event, it looks to be our largest meeting.  I'll post a
Tim May-style summary after the meeting.
