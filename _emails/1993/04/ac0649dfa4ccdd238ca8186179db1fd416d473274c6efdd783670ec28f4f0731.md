Clipper:

If anyone wants it, I can send you the text to the letter I just sent
President Clinton and the local papers. I think it is a decent,
fairly non-technical letter that might point out some of the parallels
between this crypto chip and invasion of privacy to the common person.

In my local area, I have now been responsible for 'educating' over 30
people to my interpretation of the meaning of this chip offering. I think
it is important that the public knows a little about what is going on so
that they can make a conscious decision about the usefulness of it.

I don't however, wish to waste list bandwidth with the text of it, as I
don't personally think it is a masterpeice. :)


Cypherpunks employing Cypherpunks:

On another note, I hate it when people use the list for purely personal
reasons, but I really need a summer job / internship. If you own your
own business [ :) ] or know of a _possible_ opening in a company you work
for, please, please contact me and run it by me. I am an Electrical
Engineering student at the University of Washington (I hold a 3.2 in my EE
classes) and have very few qualms about relocating over the summer (it
might even be nice if it were in the bay area, as then I could make it to
a Cypherpunk meeting!)

It'd be really nice to finally meet some of the people I've been talking
to for all of these months.

Any leads or ideas would be appreciated.
