To make a long story short, don't try to (-e) encrypt anything with PGP
on a STACKERed drive -- it ain't gonna work. When I got in this morning, 
I proved this point by encrypting without nary a problem on a 
non-compressed drive. 

The proof is in the pudding, so to speak.

Cheers.

(BTW, Kelly -- the second message that you sent is still crippled. What 
are you doing? Software (PGP) development? ;-)
