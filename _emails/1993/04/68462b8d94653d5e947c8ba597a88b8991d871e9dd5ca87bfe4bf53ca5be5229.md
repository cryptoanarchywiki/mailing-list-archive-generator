I am the writer of the original post, and I quite agree with the responce that
said that this was a bad idea.  The whole point in being secure, is being as
secure as possible.

You still have to store a secret key somewhere.  And to do that, you must trust
your system administrater.....

It was suggested that I keep my public keyring on the mainframe and use it to
read mail.  When I want to send mail, I encrypt it at home and upload it into
my mailer.  This is what I do now.  I forgot who you were, but you gave me a 
good idea.  Thanx.

What are these features?  I don't know what kerberos is.
