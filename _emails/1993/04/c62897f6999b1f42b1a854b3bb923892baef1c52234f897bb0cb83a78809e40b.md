  Who wants to collaborativly work on an information packet containing
a collection of the previous reports on the wiretap chip,  such as
the initial white house statement,  CPSR's and EFF's responses,
list of questions that were hashed at the last Cypherpunks meeting,
etc, etc.

  A smaller and easier to read infomation packet should be prepared
to hand out at raves.   These should be fairly simple,  easy to read
and comprehend while on LSD,  and other drugs,  and also easy to
fold up and tuck in your jacket pockets for later reading.   Included
might be a diskette containing PGP and a "Bone head" starter "readme"
file,  with references to additional places where more robust information
can be had.

  I volunteer to check out the rave scene,  and do an analysis on how
the ravers will respond.  :-).   I'll also try out various other ways
to reach ravers and fill them in.   It's most important to point out
ways for them to become involved in both spreading the info to others,
and if they have computers,  how they can use PGP and other encryption
software to protect their email and voice calls.

  In the not to distant future,   I will be in various media interviews,
and will have opportunity to mention these things,  and tell people how
they can get more information on what we are doing,   and how they can
be involved.    

  Anyway,  feel free to post this to any other system or network,  where
appropriate.

John D.
