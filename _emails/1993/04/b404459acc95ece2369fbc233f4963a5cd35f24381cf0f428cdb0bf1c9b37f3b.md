Who was the statesman who said, two generations ago, "Gentlemen do not read
each other's mail"?

By the way, the San Francisco Chronicle's business section's Saturday

or maybe it was
	Secure Phone Scheme Draws Fire

*\\* Anton                                                     Ubi scriptum?
