Quoting, "Thats what people have *always wanted* to do.  RSA won't let them.
 That's
why any talk of a newer friendlier Bizdos is bullshit.

Well, maybe or maybe not... the main thing is to judge by concrete actions.
I know there have been problems in the past, and reason for serious
scepticism.  But the main thing here is to keep the channels open and work
toward some kind of concrete action on RSA's part.
