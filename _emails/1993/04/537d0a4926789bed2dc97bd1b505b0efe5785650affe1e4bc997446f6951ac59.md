Sounds like you were referring to me.  I've been doing some perl
programming and have scripts to create an address block, encode a
message for transmittal with an address block, and to process one hop
of a message.  These scripts don't actually do any encryption, but
rather simulate it for testing purposes.  They're not ready for use
mailing actual messages, and I still have to finish the script for
decoding the message when it's finally recieved.  So, there's a bunch
of work to go, but it looks good so far.  I'll be sure to let everyone
know when they're in a condition to be played with by all.
