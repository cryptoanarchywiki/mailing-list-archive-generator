Hrm..That's interesting. If you're on the MBONE, the Session Directory
tool should show you upcoming events, and let you select them. It also
fires off the appropriate client software with the proper arguments,
which is the Right Thing.

I'm on the remote conferencing mailing list (rem-conf@es.net), and I
have yet to see an announcement. If I can find it, I'll tape it. 

John, have your friend drop me a note with any details he might have,
because the regular channels haven't had any information on this. Any
pointers might help me track it down.
