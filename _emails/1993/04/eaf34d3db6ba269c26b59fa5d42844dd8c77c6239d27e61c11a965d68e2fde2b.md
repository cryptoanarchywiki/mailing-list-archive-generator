*************************************************************************
DEFEAT THE BIG BROTHER PROPOSAL! JUST SAY F!CK NO TO THE PRIVACY CLIPPER!

      ************************************************************
      The security of PGP encryption for those without FTP access!

This is not an ad, but a public service announcement. NitV-BBS is FREE.

This info (and my system!) has been updated to make it easier for you to
obtain Pretty Good Privacy (PGP): Secure RSA pubkey encrytion for all!
Due to the overwhelming response, I have sought out as many ports as
possible.  After a week of exhaustive FPT/Archie searches it appears to
me that NitV-BBS is the world's singlemost comprehensive PGP site, with
executables and/or source code for the following platforms:

        Platform               exec     source     patch     extras
    
    MS-DOS (PC-DOS, etc.)       X         X                    X
    Macintosh                   X         X
    Archimedes                  X         ?
    OS/2                        X                    X 
    Amiga                       X         X
    Unix                        X         X
    NeXT                                             X

In one case I do not have the means to open the archive to see if 
it comes with the source code, thus "?".

WARNING: My DallasFax 14.4k v32bis modem does not always cooperate too
well with USR/Miracom Dual Standards.

BY MODEM TO BBS:

Call NitV-BBS (see .sig at end of message for details)
Here you will find:

File area       file name                  description

LOGIN           PGP22.ZIP         DOS version of PGP
LOGIN           PGPSHEL1.ZIP      menu/shell for PGP (DOS only)

NONIBM          PGP22B-A.LHA      PGP for Amiga (w/source)
NONIBM          ARCPGP22          PGP for Archimedes (format unknown; w/src??)
NONIBM          MACPGP22.CPT      PGP for Mac (.cpt archive)
NONIBM          PGP22.TAZ         PGP for Unix (compressed .tar; w/source)

WIN             PGP22OS2.ZIP      PGP for OS/2 (w/source patch)

LOGIN           PGP22SRC.ZIP      PGP source code & utils for DOS
NONIBM          MPGP22SC.S_H      PGP source code for Mac (BinHex .hqx encode
                                      of a .sea self-extracting archive)
MONIBM          MPGP22SC.SIG      PGP signature for validation of Mac source
NONIBM          NXTPGP22.ASC      PGP source code diff (patch) for NeXT. ASCII

A quick <T>ext search for "pgp" will yield the files for flagging quickly.

Note: original name of Mac version is:   MacPGP_2.2.cpt
      original name of Unix version is:  pgp22.tar.Z
      original name of Mac source is:    MacPGP2.2src.sea.hqx
      original name of Mac signature is: MacPGP2.2src.SIGNATURE
      NeXT patch is a concatenation of:  PGP.random.c.diff and
                                         PGP.random.c.diff.README
These names were changed because of the 12 char limit of MesSDOS filenames.

All files are direct from these FTP sites: nic.funet.fi, sony.com, 
garbo.uwasa.fi, and ftp.uni-erlangen.de. They are NOT uploaded by BBS users,
nor gotten from other BBSs.  You can rest assured that they are "clean" 
(the superparanoid^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hcautious may wish to obtain additional
copies and compare them for further validation.)

You may login anonymously as ANONYMOUS, password GUEST.  If you want the
whole lot you won't have time, as that acct. is limited. In that case,
login normally, but if you never intend to call again, please be 
courteous, and leave a <C>omment to sysop to delete your account.  
Disk space is limited! 

All user accounts are free.  There is no charge (other than your phone
expenses of course) for obtaining PGP from NitV-BBS.


BY FIDO-PROTOCOL FREQ

Anyone in FidoNet or any other FTN/FTSC network (such as RBBSNet, etc.),
or anyone with a working Fido-type mailer, can get PGP from the same
source, via File REQuest, as long as they can send mail to Fido address
1:301/2 (you will need a Fido nodelist to pull that off). You do not have
to be nodelisted to do this.  You can even be a point system. Just send
a DIRECT not routed netmail To: Sysop, NitV (1:301/2)
                            From: <your info here>
                            Re: <filename>,<filename>,<etc>
                            St: Crash, Direct, FilReq, <etc>
<filename> can be a full file name, or a "magic name". Status is not that
important, as long as the message is set for at least these 2: Direct and 
FilReq.

You can use the following magic names (which will still hold for future
releases of PGP):

Magic Name                  files                 description

PGPDOS         PGP22.ZIP, PGPSHEL1.ZIP      DOS PGP and menu/shell 
PGPAMI         PGP22B-A.LHA                 Amiga PGP & source
PGPARC         ARCPGP22                     Archimedes PGP 
PGPMAC         MACPGP22.C_H                 Mac PGP
PGPNXT         NXTPGP22.ASC                 NeXT PGP source code diff
                                              (requires a full src package)
PGPOS2         PGP22O2.ZIP                  OS/2 PGP & patch
PGPUNX         PGP22TAR.Z                   Unix PGP & source
PGPSDOS        PGP22SRC.ZIP                 PGP source & utils (DOS fmt.)
PGPSMAC        MPGP22SC.S_H, MPGP22SC.SIG   PGP source & sig (Mac fmt.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please upload, file-attach via netmail, uuencode and email, or just tell me 
where to find, any interesting utils, FAQs, etc for PGP that you come across,
so that I can make them available to the needy but FTPless hordes.

Please do NOT further distribute this copy of PGP, especially to BBSs. Part
of the Good Thing about getting it from NitV is that you know it came right
from one of the original FTP sites for it, not from some cheezy BBS via the
hands of 27 other people and systems, any of which might harbour a baddie.
This is not to say that BBSs are bad (hell, I run one!) but rather that too
much is left to chance (and ill-will!) in it's distribution methods. PGP is
a security program, and needs to be guaranteed to be secure.  Thank you.

This offer, due to IDIOTIC export restrictions, must of course be limited to
the USA.  <snort>

Authors are stongly encouraged to upload, mail, etc. their ports of PGP,
their PGP utilities, etc. directly to me or the system listed below so that
non-FTP-using PGP afficionados can be certain that they are getting a "pris-
tine" copy.  Thanks!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distribute ENTIRE contents of this message freely.
