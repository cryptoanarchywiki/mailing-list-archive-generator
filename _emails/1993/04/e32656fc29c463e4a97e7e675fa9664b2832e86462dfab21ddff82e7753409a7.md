In the days before Xerox machines, one provided copies of
correspondence to others by using sheets of carbon paper to make
duplicates when typing.

This is the origin of "cc" or "cc:" on memos and correspondence.

Henceforth, "cc" refers to the automatic carbon copy provided by the
"cc" chip, the Clipper Chip. BB (Big Brother) gets a CC of everything.

(I know, it's a voice encryption standard, and it's voluntary, but a
quick look at the "Capstone" chip reveals it's a complete crypto
package, containing the DSS government signature standard, and lots of
other stuff. The Wiretap Chip will be used for more than just voice,
I'll be willing to bet.)
