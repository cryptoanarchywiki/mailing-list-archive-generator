There have been reports about a mailing list set-up at NIST that had a
number of people on it including Mitch Kapor.

The list is named "clipper" and it was through that list that part of
the Wire Tap Chip announcement came.

I asked Mitch directly, what is involvement with that list was; I
asked him if he was involved with the development of the Wire Tap
Chip.

Below is is reply. I believe him.

I have told Mitch I will put this info out and have asked that he
make clipper list mail public at some FTP site.

I have also asked him when he started getting traffic from this list.
