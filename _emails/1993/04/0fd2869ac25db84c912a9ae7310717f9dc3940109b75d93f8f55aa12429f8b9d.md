Hmmm,  getting some mixed responses from the group on the raves
idea,   below are my comments....

That might be partially true,  and depends on the rave.   Most raves
I go to have all sorts of computer related demonstrations,  and 
exibits.    I've been getting very positive interest on the part
of rave organizers.

I agree that we should keep it non-technical,  thats why I proposed that
raves have tables set up where PGP copies can be given out,  literature
can be displayed for ravers to take home later...   Then,  there are 
those hard core cyberpunks that will take in EVERYTHING including lots
of drugs.

For those UK folks,  Craig Larson from the USA will be working with sponsors
to a totally awsome rave of an estimated 40,000 folks.   Now THATS a good
place to get the word out,  spark intererest in encryption,  etc.

And on and on..
