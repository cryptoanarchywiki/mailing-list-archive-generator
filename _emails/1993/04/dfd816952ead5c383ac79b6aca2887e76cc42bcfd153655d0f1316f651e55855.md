Bill..  There are a couple of problems with your scheme.

1) You have to have this daemon already running on host B.  I.e., you
still need to have had (at one time) access to run this daemon.
Basically, this means that you (or someone) has to have had root
access to BOTH hosts A and B to set this up.  Unless this becomes
supported software, you can't guarantee that....

2) How do you do key distribution?  If you use Kerberos, then you need
to have root access on host B.  Otherwise, you need some way to
securely get the encryption key from A to B....

3) How do you deal with multiple encryptions?  If you have more than
one client who wants to use this program, you have to trust a single
process (unless you run out of inetd, which requires #1) with all the
different keys for all the different users!

Basically, you're better off using ktelnet/ktelnetd to do this.  In
either case you have the same problem with modifying the workstation.

Please, don't let this discourage you, but I think you might want to
think this through a little more before you jump the gun!

Have a Nice Day!!! :-)
