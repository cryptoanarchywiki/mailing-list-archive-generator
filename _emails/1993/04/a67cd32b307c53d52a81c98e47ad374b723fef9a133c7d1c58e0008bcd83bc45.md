For other radio amateurs who are readers of
this list I'd like to try an experiment in
alternative (to the telephone) communication
tomorrow, Saturday 4/23/93 at 17:00 UTC
(10 am PDT).  I'd like to contact as many
of you as possible from my modest station
in Humboldt County California.

For Bay area people, let's try 7265 Mhz;
for people elsewhere in the United States and
elsewhere in the world, conditons permitting,
how about 14.335 at 17:30 UTC. +-for QRM?

I will be running 100w into a vertical, call
is KN6CP I will be asking for checkins for
the "Cypherpunks Net".

For those interested, we can do key fingerprint
exchanges at this time.

Of course non-hams are free to listen on those
frequencies (lower SSB for 7265, upper SSB for
14.335).

I'd like to explore alternative communications
nexi if for example the internet is down
for some unforseen reason :-(.
