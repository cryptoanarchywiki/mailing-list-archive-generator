This appears to be the ARA system that was previously suggested,
which I was speaking of using with penet.  Your comment that changes
would be needed implies that it is different; if so, could you
clarify the difference?

The reason Eric suggested hanging this off the side of a pseudonym
server is that it is rather inconvenient in its pure form,
particularly for unsophisticated users.  It involves a thirty-line
block of cruft, cutting and pasting... ideally your MUA would handle
everything, but this isn't going to happen soon.  Grafting this onto
a nymserver as a return address gives you the ease of use of
something like penet, without having to maintain a central
nym<--->name mapping.
