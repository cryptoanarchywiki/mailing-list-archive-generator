On news.admin.policy, a 'nym' called Nowhere, Man called somebody an
asshole and told them to fuck off.

Someone objected, and Nowhere responded:

Apparently it is in fact possible to chain remailers now.  I assume that
he is chaining through cypherpunks remailers into penet.  I'm curious to
know which remailer is being used for this purpose?  Perhaps we could add
a description of how to do this to the documentation.  My guess is that
"Nowhere" reads this list.
