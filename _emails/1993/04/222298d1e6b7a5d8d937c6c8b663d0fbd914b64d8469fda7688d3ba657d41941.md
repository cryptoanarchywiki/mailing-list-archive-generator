Well, I guess I started this thread, so lets see if I can finish it... ;^)

This is akin to using an umbrella with a hole in it and saying, "Well, at least 
my face doesn't get wet.  If you want to stay dry, you want to stay COMPLETELY
dry.

Someone posted a program, link, that would encrypt modem communcations.  Would
you post an address for it.  I can't find where I put it.

This is, IMHO, the best solution.  BTW, I have several telix scripts that make
it actually convenient, even at 1200 baud!  (gak!).  I would post them, but they
are trivial.  Thanx, Phantom, for the suggestion.  

What we need here is a "security package" that we distribute in an effort to 
make it easier to use secure practices.

And many people don't...  I've taken a minor flame or two for asking for help 
with using pgp on this list.  The whole point of this list, IMHO, is to make
strong security practices as easy and as wide-spread as possible.  Correct me
if I'm wrong.
