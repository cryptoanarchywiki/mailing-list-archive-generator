Yeah....  So if your key can be snooped off the net, so can your
cleartext.  To decript online, then, is akin to using only weak
encription...which indicates only the desire for limited privacy.

But if even if you do decript online, you're still protected from
file snooping.

What's needed is PGP decription built into your terminal program.
