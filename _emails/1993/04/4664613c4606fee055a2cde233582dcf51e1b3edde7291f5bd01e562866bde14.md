Eli,

Of course the guys with the STU phones will keep them, this is Type II 
security, which is of a lower level.

The people who really need these phones are the civil servants in these
departments:

Agriculture
Commerce
Education
Energy
EPA
HHS
HUD
Interior
Justice
Labor
State
Transportation
Treasury
Veterans Affairs

...that is, people in positions to missapropriate funds, or create 
overly generous contracts with their future employers.  There is no
good argument that these functionaries shouldn't be Clippered, except
that nobody should be.  ""National Security"" doesn't apply here.

You also seem to be thinking with two cliches:

1. You can't fight city hall.

2. This is the way things have always been, this is the way they always
will be.

The guys who put this in motion certainly aren't thinking with 2), but they
sure are hoping you're thinking with 1).

Please expunge both of them from your mind and replace then with an 
appreciation of forces and masses: Judo.
