Don't think so.  Unless you have fiber running from your location (your home)
to the calling party's location.

The tap is placed on the subscriber loop - which for the time being is analog
for most voice service.  And even if it is digital, it is still copper from
the CO.

If you are concerned with eavesdropping, then your statement is accurate.
It is very easy to eavesdrop on microwave and satellite long distance.

I suspect the Clipper chip will be used heavily in digital cellular phones,
if it isn't too much of a power hog.
