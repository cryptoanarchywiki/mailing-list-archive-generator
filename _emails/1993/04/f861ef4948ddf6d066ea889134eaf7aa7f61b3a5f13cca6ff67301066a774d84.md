Not that I'm exactly of godlike hacking proportions, but these are obvious
to me....  

	patience, persistance, obsessiveness, curiousity

also, there's no such thing as a dumb question, but it's not terribly
difficult to ask questions in the wrong place and,thereby, waste other
people's time and piss them off.  Your question isn't terribly appropriate
to the cypherpunks list and it's so amazingly general that you won't get
anything but a general answer.

the most important thing about being a hacker is working with other
hackers.  Despite common misperceptions, hacking is a social thing.
