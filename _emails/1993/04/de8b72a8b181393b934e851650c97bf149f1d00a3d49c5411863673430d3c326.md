Okay, here are my sound bytes:

1. The long one (needed when they try to outlaw encryption):

As we move into the electronic frontier, the freedom to use crypto-privacy 
technology is becoming the equivalent to the right to bear arms:
it is the last line of defense against a tyrannic government.  The good 
news is that privacy is a defensive technology, not an offensive one.
Giving up this un-enumerated right could be disasterous to future 
generations.

2. The short one (simple-minded Clipper is no good):

Crypto Privacy is like a bullet proof vest for your transmitted speech; 
the Clipper chip is a paper jacket with extra zippers in the back.
