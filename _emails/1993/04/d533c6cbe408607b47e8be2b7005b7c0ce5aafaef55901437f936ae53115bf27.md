Comp.risks is carrying extensive coverage of the Clipper Chip issue,
including Dorothy Denning attempting to defend the Clipper.

Sci.crypt and alt.security.clipper still have more messages, but
comp.risks seems to be the place I check first. Being a digest,
though, a new one only appears a few times a week.
