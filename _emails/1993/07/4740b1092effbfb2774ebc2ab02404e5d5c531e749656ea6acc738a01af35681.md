Its public knowledge?
were's the proof?
Not one academic researcher has found it (and lived to publish
about it).
On the other hand some very respectable cryptographers have
been able to show that the design critereon has made for
very well chosen parameters.

The FBI has shown that they dont know a backdoor in DES or at least
they wont use it against suspects.  There have been cases were
data was encrypted with DES and the suspect refused to turn over
the keys.
