Consider that it is much easier to make quick comments about tee shirts
than strategic decisions regarding sound bites for the press.  Thus,
the opportunity cost of these comments is fairly low and that also
explains the volume.

That said, here's another addition to the melange:


How about a tee shirt that has the source code to RSA or DES on it.
Could I wear it while flying out of the U.S.?


Curious person:	What's that on your tee shirt?

Cypherpunk:	It's the source code to a program that cannot be exported
	outside the U.S.A.  Banned information.  

Curious person:	How can information be banned?  I thought the First
	Amendment protected that.

Cypherpunk:	Not for export...It's considered munitions even though
	this source code is available in books and on computers almost
	anywhere in the world.

Curious person:	Looks fairly innocuous to me.

Cypherpunk: 	The French consider it second only to nuclear weapons.

Curious person:	Now that's what I call a power tee shirt!


If the source is too big (how about one long bar code: information-wear
(Mondo2000 could feature it as a centerfold)), perhaps the core
algorithm could be depicted.

Okay, I'll stop having fun now...;^)
