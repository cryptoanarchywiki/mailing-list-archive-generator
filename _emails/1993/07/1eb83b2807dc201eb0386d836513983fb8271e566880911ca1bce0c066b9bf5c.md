That part of the solution is already done.  There are already several very
good POP/IMAP clients for Macs and PCs (Eudora, NuPOP, etc).  Why the
fixation on a particular mail agent?  There is no way that you are going to
get people to agree on a single MUA, therefore it seems that the comm
channel is the beastie that one should focus on for encryption.

I hate to break it to you, but there already exists a protocol for off-line
reading of mail and news over serial connections: QWK.  While a noble
effort, I sincerely doubt that the BBSers and CI$ users are going to jump
over to a completely new protocol for transport of information for off-line
reading unless it offers them something that they do not already have, and
IMAP/POP just doesn't do that.  If one were to be able to offer encrypted
TCP/IP connectivity though, then you would be offering people the additional
functionality of this comm channel (telnet, ftp, gopher/www, etc) to entice
them to switch over.

Why not just get them to support IP?  Probably easier...  All they need is
a slip/ppp driver on the host, then you can do the encryption over comm
channel and avoid wasting time encrypting something that doesn't need to be
encrypted.  Many BBS systems are beginning to wade through the shallow
water of the Internet, if we had the ability to offer them modifications to
provide encryption to thier IP connectivity while they are still new to the
game it would be much easier to get them accostomed to the idea that such
traffic should offer encryption; not that I think this will happen, but in
an ideal world...
