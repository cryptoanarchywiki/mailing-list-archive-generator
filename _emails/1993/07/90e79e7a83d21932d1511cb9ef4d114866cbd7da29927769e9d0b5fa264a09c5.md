Presumably, this is the case, though why mail is bouncing from so many
places all of a sudden when sent from all over the country, I can't say.
I was able to get pings back from penet today after having mail there
bounce.  I was writing in response to a complaint from another user in
the midwest who could no longer get mail to run through penet.
.   Charcoal's still not working.
.   Mail has stopped bouncing at cypherpunks@toad.com apparently, though
the site that receives cypherpunks for me has been getting nothing for
over two weeks.  Seems I can send, but that's it.
.   <sigh!>
