In 1991, Tygar and Yee published a paper describing an authentication
and security system for Mach.  At least two of the techniques
described in the paper can be used elsewhere; one is a zero-knowledge
proof of identity algorithm, and the other is a public-key algorithm
for exchanging arbitrary data (i.e., private encryption keys).

The security of the scheme is based on the intractability of
determining quadratic residuosity.  Variable $a$ is a quadratic
residue on $n$---it has the Jacobi value of 1---if and only if there
exists some $x$ such that $(x^2\mod n)=a$; otherwise it is not a
residue and has Jacobi value -1.  (If $n$ is prime, the Jacobi value
is also the Legendre value).  Rabin(???) has proven that working
backwards from $a$ and $n$ to find $x$ is equivalent to factoring
$n$, so only the person who generated $n$ will be able to check the
residuosity of $a$ (if factoring $n$ is difficult, of course).

In the private key exchange algorithm, for example, the Sender
generates a series of quadratic residues and non-residues $a$ over
$n$ and passes these values on to the Receiver.  The Receiver
calculates the (non-)residuosity for each and assigns it a bit value,
thus building up a string of bits that determine the key.  Any Tapper
will be unable to calculate the residuosities from the data stream,
and so will not intercept the key.

I've written a bunch of programs to generate keys and run an
encrypted bit exchange, but the performance is lacking.  Decoding
time seems to grow at $O(\el^2)$ with the length of $p,q$, which
makes using any sort of secure public-key $n$ quite infeasible---
especially if people want to use these algorithms on small home boxes
for dialup security.  On a 386/40, receiving 56 bits encoded with a
512 bit public key takes twenty-two minutes...

So: anyone know tricks to bum as much speed as possible out either
the Jacobi or Legendre algorithms?  For our purposes, they are
equivalent.  If the Tygar and Yee algorithms ever run efficiently,
they could be very nice alternatives to RSA.
