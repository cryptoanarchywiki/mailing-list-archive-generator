Effective immediately, all cypherpunks mail will appear to originate
from 'owner-cypherpunks'.  Previously the name was
'cypherpunks-request'.  This change only affects those of you using
mail filters which are filtering on the out-of-band "From " line.
This change was made so that I can more easily separate bounce
messages from list requests.

Eric
