They decided that West Coast covers should feature Peter Gabriel and the
East Coast covers Mitch Kapor.  Something about rock and roll playing
better on newsstands than policy everywhere but the Northeasteast corridor.
 All subscribers got the Gabriel cover.

As the Wired editor told me this split cover was a last minute decision and
a first-time experiment.  The Cypherpunks were on the cover all of copies
of issue #2.
