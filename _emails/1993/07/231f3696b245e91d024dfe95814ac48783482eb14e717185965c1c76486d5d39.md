Someone wrote this, sorry the attribution got cut off.

Anyone who thinks that ANYONE on usenet speaks for their company, unless
explicitly stated, should have their damned head examined.  It was a clear
ploy to attempt to get the poor guy fired by someone who disagreed with his
opinion and decided to get nasty about it.  What an asshole.  Unfortunately,
it worked.

I think Microsoft ought be boycotted for this outrageous crap.  IMO.
I also think the guy that complained to Microsoft ought to have his head
examined ... AFTER his mailbox grows a couple hundred megs or so from
outraged people sending him mail expressing THEIR opinion.
