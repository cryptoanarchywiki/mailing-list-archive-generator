OK, I've gotten a whole bunch of requests for more information,
so I'll post it to the group.

The gathering runs from tomorrow (Friday, 7/30) through Monday
8/2.  I don't have details handy here at work, but
Giuseppe Cimmino <0005533039@mcimail.com> called Wooden Shoe
Books (Philly's major Anarchist center and the main organizer
of the gathering) and got the following info from them...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Action is Friday and Monday at 1st Unitarian Church, 2125 Chestnut - Friday
2pm-7pm, Monday 9am-1:30pm.  Saturday and Sunday at Friends Select Church, 16th
and Arch - both days 10am-6pm.

Wooden Shoe's phone number is 215-569-2477
