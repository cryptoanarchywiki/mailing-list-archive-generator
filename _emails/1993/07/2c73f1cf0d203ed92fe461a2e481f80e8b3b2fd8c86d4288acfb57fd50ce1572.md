Not much bandwidth in that medium there...

Things like gif/jpeg images and sound files have a ton of semi-random bits
in them that you can fool around with without anyone noticing much, but
plain text in news headers and postings just doesn;t leave one with much
room for putting in a message.  At least not without being blanently
obvious...
