     Well, I got a lot of good discussion about when to sign someone's key. 
I have since come up with my own policy on when I will sign a key. 
Actually, I plagarized much of it from the many good responses I received. 
If anyone looks at my policy, recognizes their words and objects, please
tell me.  Otherwise, after about 10 days, I will make my statement a matter
of public domain.  Also, If you have any comments/questions/additions to my
statement, please tell me  I hope this will help clear up some of the
confusion reguarding when to sign someone's key.  Laters.
 
BTW, what do you think of my new sig?
