	A while back someone, (I hink it was John) made a post abot
	doing some prototyping of some digital money applications.
	Did anything happen with this?  If not, can someone please
	tell me how I can get in charge with the person who has the patents,
	of a company which can send me info on how I would go about
	using it.   Any whitepapers that you know off would help as well
