  I am putting final touches on the Cypherpunks flyer,  and need the
following information.

The address,  phone number,  and Email adddess of:

  a) CPSR
  b) EFF
  c) Cypherpunks
  
Naturally I have the Email address of the Cypherpunks,  but I also need
a non-computer address,  or phone number where non-computer folks can
contact on how they can:

  a) Support the cypherpunks cause
  b) Obtain copies of PGP
  c) Or help out in other ways.

I need this info ASAP,  as I only have access to Lazerwriter today only.

I would appreciate a phone call if possible as well as Email.

Time is of the essence...

Crunch
