Well, I read the post, too, and I thought it was funny!  Obviously not meant to
be informative.  I feel that people such as DD and LEA-mongers are @#$%ing 
idiots.  And in a free forum, I should be able to say so.  This is kinda what
Cypherpunks stand for, IMHO.

And the second rule of most martial arts is, "Never get hit."  In light of all 
of the LEA's trying to "hit" us, this is something to think about.

Just my $.02.  Laters.
