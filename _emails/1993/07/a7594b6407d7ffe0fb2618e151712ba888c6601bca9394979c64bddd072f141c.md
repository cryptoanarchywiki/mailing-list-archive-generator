Anyone know anything about Motorola's new phones (models VST 100, VST 350,
VST 550, locally priced at $179, $249 and $299 Canadian)?

This is what the ad says:

- Motorola's newest telephones add nothing to cellular, but do set a new
standard for Cordless Technology.

- The Secure Clear (tm) Technology is the only Cordless Telephone to
virtually eliminate any possibility of eaves dropping.

- Motorola Cordless Telephones project a scrambled signal making it
virtually impossible to monitor a conversation with other Cordless Phones,
scanners or baby monitors.

- The Motorola Secure Clear (tm) Cordless Phones are available in three
models:  VST 550, VST 350, VST 100.

- The New Secure Clear (tm) Cordless Telephones meet the same rigid
quality and durability standards demanded of all Motorola products.

There are pictures and feature lists... and then a phone number, which I
have been trying to get through fo 2 hours...  1-800-668-1117

{As if it was obvious... the bottom line says:
   Secure Clear (tm) and Motorola are Trademarks of Motorola Inc.}
