     Could we send our postings to the mailer in encrypted format?  That 
     is... I would encrypt the message with the public key for the mailer, 
     the mailer would decrypt and re-post to the clear-text mailer and to 
     the PGP group.  
     
        Granted, because the mailer must be run in full auto mode, it won't 
     be the most secure.  It would mean that all inbound as well as 
     outbound cypherpunk traffic to my node would be in an electronic 
     envelope.
