I dunno enough about STU-III phones. Maybe they don't care about man
in the middle, or maybe they use fixed conventional of some sort for
authentication. I have a vague memory of someone telling me that some
of them have code keys.

However, just as an exercise, I suggest people convince themselves of
how easy it is to play "man in the middle" on a D-H connection. Its
valuable to go through it in your head.
