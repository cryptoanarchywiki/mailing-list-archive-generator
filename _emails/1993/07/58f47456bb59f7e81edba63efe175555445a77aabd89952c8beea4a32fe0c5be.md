The point wasn't to be unbreakably secure; it was to be UNFINDABLY secure.  We
convolute an allready encrypted message to the point of not being recognizable
as cyphertext, then we hide it on the end of a file.  We want it to look like
garbage.

Agreed.  This leaves us with several OTP's laying around in zip format.  This 
isn't so bad as long as we don't forget the original 7 keys.  The main purpose
of all of this is plausible deniability.

Thanx for your comments.  Still listening.
