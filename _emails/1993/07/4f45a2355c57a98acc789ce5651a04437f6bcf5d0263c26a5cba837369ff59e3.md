They're not all in our nation's capital. The DC Bar allows lawyers
admitted to other jurisdictions to "waive into" DC if their MBE
score is sufficiently high--no separate bar exam. Many lawyers get
admitted to the DC Bar this way in anticipation of the possibility that
someday they may have to do some legal work in DC. 

Conversely, lots of lawyers simply come to DC without getting admitted
to the DC Bar. They just don't practice in the District.
