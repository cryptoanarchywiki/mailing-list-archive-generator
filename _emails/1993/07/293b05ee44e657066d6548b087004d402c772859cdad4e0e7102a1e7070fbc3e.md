I noticed that some copies of the latest "Wired" have Peter Gabriel on the
cover and others have Mitch Kapor on the cover. What gives?

Some sort of experiment? A novel way to gauge reader reaction to the
covers? A lawsuit that forced a change in the covers?

Esthetics? (My issue, with Peter Gabriel on the cover, is much artier,
though harder to figure out, than the relatively mundane image of Kapor.)

(Peter Gabriel, being a musician, may be said to be doing "a cover of a
piece by Mitch Kapor.")

Is Crunch on another set of covers? 

Did the issue with some of us Cypherpunks on the cover merely represent one
of _several_ versions of the cover? (I envision the "Crypto Rebels" covers
going to the Bay Area, the "Dish-Wallahs" covers going overseas, and the
"Brenda Laurel" covers going directly to "Mondo 2000" headquarters in
Berkeley.)

P.S. The issue of "Wired" is superb, as always.
