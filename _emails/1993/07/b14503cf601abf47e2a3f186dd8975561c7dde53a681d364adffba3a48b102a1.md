While looking through my weekly snail after getting home last night, I
opened up a advertising card deck put together by Info Security News.
One particular advertisement got my attention, which I am going to
send for more technical information and perhaps a catalogue. (I have
used Racal-Datacom routing, bridging and mux equipment extensively,
and all-in-all, they're pretty solid boxes. Caveat: This point, however,
has no reflection on the quality of their s-boxes.)
 
Here is the complete text on the postcard:
 
"Encryption You Can Depend On!
 
Racal-Datacom, a world leader in data encryption, offers a full range
of high-quality Datacryptor (Registered Trademark) encryptors for use
in Government, Banking and Finance, R&D, and any application that
needs secure data transmissions!

The address (should anyone be interested) is:

(The small, black and white picture on the postcard reveals a small
box, not unlike an external modem, with two key-locks on the front
panel.)
