The black ink that is used to print the front side of U.S. cash contains a
very finely ground black iron oxide powder.  The ink is magnetic.  This
magnetism is used mostly by vending & change machines to distinguish real
bills from forgeries/photocopies.

A vending machine that accepts paper money typically has three tests for
cash validity.

          1. A digital image scan and imagage signature comparison.
             This test also determines the denomination of the bill.
             (good photocopies of bills can get past this test)
     
          2. Ultraviolet light test.  Real bills (printed on non-chemically
             treated paper) do not glow.  Most other papers, especially
             chemically whitened papers do glow, and are flagged as fakes.

          3. Magnetic ink detection.  Real bills are printed with magnetic
             ink, forgeries/photocopies are not.
