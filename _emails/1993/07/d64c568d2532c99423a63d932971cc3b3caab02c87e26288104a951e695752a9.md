	I wouldn't know, but to stay completely safe, it *might* be a good
idea to use environment variables.

CRYPTOPROGRAM=pgp

system(strcat(getenv("CRYPTOPROGRAM"), " -m foobar"))

	(I'm not well-versed in strcat, so this could be wrong, but you
know what I mean.)
	Then you're not mentioning PGP at all in the code. (Env. variables
for the options would be a good idea as well.. that way you can't be
attacked under the premise, "It's OBVIOUSLY for PGP, because the options
are PGP-options.")

	One feature I'd like would be easy to parse PGP output. That way PGP
can be more easily integrated with other programs. For example, doing
the following:

(-p for "easyparse"?)
pgp -p <signed.txt

	Would create output to stderr:

3434/344D
Sameer Parekh <zane@genesis.mcs.com>

	Then a program can parse it very easily. A successful sig would give
a return code of 0, and failed sig would have a nonzero return code.
