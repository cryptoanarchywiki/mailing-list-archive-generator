Yes, they are active.

It depends what you are trying to get to here?  The keyservers were
created as a way to implement out-of-band key distribution.  They
provide an easy way for you to get someone's key before initiating
contact with this person.

The key-servers do not do any key authentication, leaving the
validity-checking up to the end user.  It does leave a few things
open, namely, anyone can see who has keys on the servers.  But once a
US-legal PGP does come out (RSN, I believe), it won't be as big a
deal.

I hope this helps.
