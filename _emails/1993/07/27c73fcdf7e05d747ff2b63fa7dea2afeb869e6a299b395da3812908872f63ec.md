Today, in one of those profound moments, I had a thought...  I'm still in
pain, so my therapy is to share with all of you.

Canadian money is not only colorful, its bar coded...  I'm so poor that I
don't have two of the same bills handy to compare them, but I suspect that
the bar codes only help identify the denomination (for vending machines
and the like) and not the serial number on the bill.  The serial number
would, however, be very easy to read by OCR...  after akk the numbers were
printed by a machine and should all be the same font, size, etc.

What are the odds that banking machines are actually tracking which bills
they give you.  If the banks then later checked out where the money was
coming from, they could do some very interesting demographics... and it
would be a great way to help catch bank machine criminals...

Anyway, I know I'm just being paranoid...  aren't I?
