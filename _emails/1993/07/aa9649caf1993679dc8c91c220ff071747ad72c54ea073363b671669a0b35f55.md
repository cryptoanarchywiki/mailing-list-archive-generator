EFF as of July will no longer be keeping up with Phrack. Eventually, Phrack
will be removed from the archive (I beleive). I thought this was well 
publicized...maybe not. From what I have read, Phrack accounts for over 50% of
all their traffic. They have been exceeding their lease-line agreement and
have been paying nearly twice their budgeted line-cost, etc... You get the
picture.
