I think encrypting who the message is from and the subject would be
best that way I can have a subject of "Plans to Kill Pauly Shore"
after I decrypt the message.

For how the service should work, I think you should look into MIME. You 
can include encrypted text that will decrypt when you read it with
your mail program.
