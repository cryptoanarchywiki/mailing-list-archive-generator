 While I'm not trying to offend anyone in particular, I think this
 attitude hurts cypherpunks more than it helps us. I called Phil
 Mulivor this morning and had a long chat with him. He seems very
 knowledgeable about the intrinsic value of digital communications
 mediums, especially the Internet.
 
 Speaking your mind in a public fashion can sometimes help progress,
 Dave.
 
 Get involved.
 
 Cheers,
