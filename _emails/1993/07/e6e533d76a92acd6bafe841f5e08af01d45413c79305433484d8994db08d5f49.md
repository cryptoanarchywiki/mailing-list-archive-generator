If they control the machine, anything is easily compromised.  One way
is to replace the standard crypt with a special one that secretly
saves a copy of the plaintext.

The alternatives you suggest suffer from the same problem.  If you
want to encrypt securely, you'll have to encrypt the plaintext on a
system that you trust - a computer that only you have access to is
best.

Depending on your privacy needs, an account on a system where you
trust the administrators not to abuse their privilege may be
sufficient.  While providing less privacy than encryption, it can be
more convenient.  It will certainly make it harder for them to harrass
you.
