I've only been on the list a few days now, and the net for only a few
weeks.  Plesae pardon the apology :) but could someone please explain
to me why we are not putting an "Encryption: PGP <my-public-key>" line
in the header of each of our messages as allowed by RFC 822 (which I
was just reading for the first time today)

---Begin quote of RFC822 on Internet Message Header formats:---

     4.7.3.  ENCRYPTED

             Sometimes,  data  encryption  is  used  to  increase  the
        privacy  of  message  contents.   If the body of a message has
        been encrypted, to keep its contents private, the  "Encrypted"
        field  can be used to note the fact and to indicate the nature
        of the encryption.  The first <word> parameter  indicates  the
        software  used  to  encrypt the body, and the second, optional
        <word> is intended to  aid  the  recipient  in  selecting  the
        proper  decryption  key.   This  code word may be viewed as an
        index to a table of keys held by the recipient.

This would certainly solve many obvious problems.  Of course, you all
have seen this stuff for years and are not doing it so there must be
some really interesting reason... ?

Feel free to respond to me by email instead of posting to the group
and if anyone else wants to know, I'll forward responses to them.  If
I've struck a chord, by all means let's discuss this as well as t-shirts.

BTW, I'm looking forward to subscribing to alt.cypherpunks.merchandising :)
