Anonymous posting and mail have up three times in the past few days, in
non-cypherpunk readings of mine.

1) In the Young Scientists Network, one of the list moderators
mentioned that an anonymous post was received, and to please not do
that in the future.  However, the reason given was that it is
difficult to contact the author of the post.

Since the moderator mentioned he was unable to contact the author, I
am guessing a cypherpunk remailer was used.  Importantly though,
anonymous submissions were discouraged only because of the
inconvenience of contacting the author.

2) The latest Computer Underground Digest #5-51.  The issue it about
the "cleansing" of the AIS BBS run by Kim Clancy.  Read the issue; Jim
Thomas was upset at this form of witch-hunting, in which accusations
were made anonymously.  A cypherpunk remailer was used in this
situation.

Although Jim and others were understandable upset about the situation,
I felt they were more upset about what the anonymous poster(s) said;
not so much the fact he(they) posted anonymously.  Or rather, the fact
anonymity was used in the manner it was.

3) Phrack 43 - includes a list of cypherpunk remailers in one of the
articles!  Looks like the remailers are getting some publicity, as
well as the ftp site.
