There is a conference in Boston for the Usenix Symposium on Mobile and
Location-Independent Computing.  I know that a couple a cypherpunks
are at least involved in the conference, and I was wondering if people
would be interested in a quick gettogether or BOF of some kind.

Since I really don't know how to organize this, I can only collect
names of interested individuals.

So, is anyone interested????
