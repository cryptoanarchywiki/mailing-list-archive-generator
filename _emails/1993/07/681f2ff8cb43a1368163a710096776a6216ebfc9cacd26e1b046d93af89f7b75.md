Here in Oceania (Orwell's name), the War on (Some) Drugs has caused
kids to be sent through a mandatory 12-week anti-drug brainwashing program
called "D.A.R.E.," for "Drug Abuse Resistance Education." The schools
administer this (my sister's stepson went through it in Kalifornia and
spouted anti-drug slogans for a few weeks....then he realized the
stupidity of it and is probably now more inclinded to try drugs just
as a counterreaction to the dweebs who gave the class).

In theory, the little junior Pavel Morozovs learn how to spot signs of
drug use in their parents, how to "Just Say No" to such dangerous
drugs as aspirin (illegal to have aspirin or Tylenol in most public
schools, even with note from parent), and how to dial a toll-free
number to call in the narcs and drug warriors.

Anyway, I have long wanted to get a t-shirt or sweatshirt
silk-screened with "D.A.R.E." on it, as so many phony parents are now
parent (I think the kiddies get gold stars if they sell one of these
shirts to their parents). But *my* shirt would go something like this:

"D. rugs
   A. re
     R. eality 
       E. nhancers"


I figure this'd shake a few folks up! (I wonder which states such a
shirt is now illegal in?)

I'm not really into drugs, but I hate this kind of sanctimonious
preaching (the DARE propaganda), and I'd love to see the reaction of
these phonies at the gym I go to.

The War on (Some) Drugs is clearly being used for no-knock searches,
deadly raids, seizure of property grossly out of proportion to the
alleged crimes (and sometime the property is simply forfeited and a
trial is never held--I can't understand how this is done, or upheld by
courts), and other such travesties.

As Phil Karn put it, "national security" is the root password of the
Constitution--invoke it and the Constitution is bypassed. To this we
can add "drug war," "money laundering," and "banned weapons." Maybe
even "unauthorized crypto."

P.S. Speaking of t-shirts...maybe we ought to think about some
Cypherpunks shirts?
