	On the subject of whether personal postings should be considered
as representing the company, I should point out that:

1:	NSF and several regional nets have acceptable use policies which
	do not permit commercial use. 
2:	Messages posted by the company (or by someone who is assumed to
	represent the company) would be in violation of these policies if the
	messages crossed the applicable networks. 
3:	There is no way to prevent a specific message over usenet from crossing
	a specific network.
4:	The owner of a network site (the company) is assumed to be responsible
	for any "unacceptable use" traffic that comes from the site.
5:	This liability would leave the company open to having its net feed
	cut off for such unacceptable use.

	It is therefore in the best interests of any corporation with
Internet/Usenet access to _assume_ that messages posted by its employees
are not company business.

	So what's all the fuss about? :-)
