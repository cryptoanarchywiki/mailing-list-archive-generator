For a steganographically strong code, it is not enough to make it
unrecognizable to its home program.  The ciphertext must look like something
"innocent" to either a human reader or a computer program designed to look
for ciphertext.  For example, the message could be hidden in the least
significant intensity bits of a bitmapped picture that the intended recipient
has an unmodified copy of.

If data that looks like random noise is innocent enough, then it is not hard
to hack PGP or write another encryption program that intentionally lacks any
signature information.  I wrote several programs with this property.  The two
best examples are CRYPTE and CRYPTMPJ, both of which are available on the
Rainbow Missions BBS at 303-938-9654.  This makes them a little harder to use
than PGP and similar programs, because the user has to know in advance when
encryption and decryption are appropriate, and which algorithm to use. 

Allowing a signature in the file format makes it obvious which program was
used to encrypt the data (thus slightly reducing security), but it makes it
easier to use the program.  This increase in ease of use makes it more likely
that it will be used, and that increases security.
