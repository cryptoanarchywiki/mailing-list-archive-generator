I was the one who called Denning a "fucking idiot".  Perhaps I should have
said "fucking naive idiot" and been more specific, because while it might
make sense for her to be "in bed with" the intelligence community to *her*,
it makes no sense to anyone else I've talked to.  In my view, she's either
being criminally naive in being a mouthpiece for the NSA, being bought off
by them, being threatened by them, has a personal/financial interest in
the whole Clipper fiasco, or sees a political advantage in aligning herself
with them.  As has been discussed (to death, probably) in sci.crypt,
alt.security*, etc., Clipper has several apparent flaws, none of which I'll
go into here.  Why would someone who is supposed to be some sort of "expert"
be endorsing such a scheme is beyond me, unless she is being motivated by
one of the above.  In any case, the endorsement of such a scheme is naive
in the extreme and almost criminally irresponsible of her, given the nature
of Clipper/Capstone and the history of the intelligence community using
such technology to spy on its own citizens in illegal operations.

*That's* what I meant by my "fucking idiot" remark.

Bidzos is just trying to make a buck.  Sternlight seems to be anally
retentive in the extreme, and believes his own bullshit.

The first rule of most martial arts, as the first rule of combat, is "never
underestimate your opponent".  However irresponsible I may think Dorothy
Denning, Jim Bidzos, or David Sternlight are, I don't underestimate them.
If any one of those three (or anyone else, for that matter) has something to
say, I will listen and judge it on its own merits.
