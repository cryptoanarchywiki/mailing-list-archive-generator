I would like to hold a meeting on the second saturday in August, the
8th, to corespond with the California meeting.  I can get a room at
MIT unless someone else has a better place.  Also, can people give me
topics for the agenda?  I'm sure people have things they want to talk
about.

Send agenda items to me, directly.
Send problems/questions/place suggestions to the list.
