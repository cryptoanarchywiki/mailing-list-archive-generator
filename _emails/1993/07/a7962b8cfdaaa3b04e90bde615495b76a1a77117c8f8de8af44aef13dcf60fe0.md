A little background on my remailer...  My machine is connected to the net
at large via UUCP...  And I only have one phone line at home, which me and
the family share with the computer.  So it only polls out for mail when
we're asleep (22:30 CDT - 7:30 CDT).  And, I'll admit, when the weather gets
ugly enough here in Minnesota, the machine gets powered down to keep the
place cooler.

That's the disadvantage of the remailer at rebma.  The advantage is that since
I own the machine, the remailer will stay in operation, period.  (I think
my service provider does have a clause in the agreement that mentions that
use that prevents other users from getting service will not be tolerated,
but that's it.)

So, if you're looking for fast turnaround time, remailer@rebma.mn.org is not
for you.  If a long delay can be used as an advantage, more power to you.
