Over the past few years many LEA pseudo-documentary-tabloid shows have
appeared on TV (I figure it all started with Raygun's WOD) with
re-creations of events using actors.  They usually are portrayed as if
they were real to the extent of bluring out faces, etc. (that is, no
disclaimers and everything appears to be done live with no indication
of due process).   I've seen this stuff whilst channel surfing in hotel
rooms (the only time I watch TV, really) and it seems very sick.  I
suppose the producers of such shows don't find legalities like warrants
to be interesting enough, so they leave it out.  So much for TV being
educational.  If the general public becomes so dulled to apparent
violations of rights as depicted in realistic settings, the cynicism
that Nixon had for the general public might one day become true (e.g.,
Nixon, as documented by transcripts declassified this year, said
that people don't care about wiretapping--they think it happens all
the time.  (I wonder why this statement by Nixon was protected for 
National Security for ~20 years...))
