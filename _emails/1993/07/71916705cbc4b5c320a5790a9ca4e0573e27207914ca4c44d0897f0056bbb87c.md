I understand your precaution and problem very well. I have had similar fears.
Recently, I was in similar situation recently. I wanted to exchange keys
with someone I have met only once. The situation as it arose actually ended
up working okay. We exchanged keys after encrypting them with the normal
encryption option, with a password being someone at the place we meet.
Knowledge common to only a few select people. Then we started a talk session
at a prescribed time at the relevant addresses and tried to rely on information
specific dialogue to verify one's person as the one in question. Without
physically being there this seems like at least a little extra security.
As to the broader question you are really asking on verification I am unsure
on how it can be solved. Obviously my situation was unique that we had met
and could decide on an information basis, that would seemingly be hard to
duplicate, but this is not always available.
