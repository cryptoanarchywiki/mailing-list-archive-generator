Hi,

I just started reading this mailing list and I've run into a few problems
reading some of the messages because they include MIME information
which my copy of MH chokes on for some reason. It doesn't like the x-text
and text/x-pgp content-types. Would anybody on this list have a fix for
that so I can continue to read this list with MH? Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

Chris
