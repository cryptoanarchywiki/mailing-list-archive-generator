What if you are using a cheap vocoder because you don't have lots of
available CPU? With cheap vocoders, voices are not easily recognized.

What if you are using data and not voice?

DH key exchange is great -- if you are willing to do something to
actively authenticate the other end. Several protocols to do this have
been developed. Personally, I would not recommend doing without them
just on the basis that "I can recognise Fred's voice".
