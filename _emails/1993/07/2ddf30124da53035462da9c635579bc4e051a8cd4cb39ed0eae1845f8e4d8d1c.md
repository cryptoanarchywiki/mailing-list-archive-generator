You can't even solve the problem with DH key exchange -- you are
subject to "man in the middle" attacks. You must share SOME
information via a secure channel in order to have both authentication
and privacy on a channel. However, the information exchanged could be
small and fairly one-time -- like the public key of a trusted entity
that signs other public keys.
