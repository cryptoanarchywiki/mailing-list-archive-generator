Just a quick note to say that I sent out a packet of tests for the
remailers via the RBBSnet UUCP gate following the standard Cypherpunks
form:

To: remailer@some.place.edu

::
Request-Remailing-To: me@my.address.com

This is a test of the ... remailer...

I sent this message to each of the following:

hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu
hh@cicada.berkeley.edu
hh@soda.berkeley.edu
phantom@mead.u.washington.edu
00x@uclink.berkeley.edu
remailer@utter.dis.org

I received the test message via the remailer@utter.dis.org quickly &
without problems.  I have yet to get the other messages, nearly a week
later.  With the exception of remailer@utter.dis.org, all of these have
been habitually unresponsive to regular tests.  I have been able to get
the soda remaier to work once, & with the efforts of the remailer
operator, was able to get the phantom remailer to work once.

I have been unable to get the anonymus+info@charcoal.com remailer to
accept mail after some six attempts.  The Charcoal daemon bounces back
the messages as coming to an unknown addressee.

The Extropia PGPed remailer seems to work well, as does the
hal@alumni.caltech.edu remailer.  Nearly everything else seems very
iffy.

Which remailers claim to be able to mail directly to newsgroups?
