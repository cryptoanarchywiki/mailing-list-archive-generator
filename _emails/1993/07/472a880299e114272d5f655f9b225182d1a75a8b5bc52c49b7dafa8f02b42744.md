Now this is news to me.  You mean that they can listen to me if they can 
rationalize that there is a threat to national security?

Here's a scenerio.  John Q. Public HAS a copy of pgp and some LEA knows it.  It
must be that he's some kind of subversive. Therefore, he is a threat to national
security.  It is therefore legal to infringe on his rights?  Maybe this is a bit
of exageration...maybe it's not....
