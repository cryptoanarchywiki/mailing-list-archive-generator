True, but how much do you need if you have code dictionaries?  The Message-ID
field, for example, could contain a page.word reference, one that meant
"the cops are watching me, be careful", or "Nuclear detonator received".
Not much the NSA could do to figure that one out unless they had searched
your place, or knew a HELL of a lot about you and your co-conspirator.

My point was, there are a lot of covert channels that one can use without
making it obvious that there is any sort of covert data being passed.
