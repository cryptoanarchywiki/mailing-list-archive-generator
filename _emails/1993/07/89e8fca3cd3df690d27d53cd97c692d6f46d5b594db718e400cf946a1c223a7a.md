Sadly, the Friedmans already cracked the "multiple repeating xored
keys" cypher a while back -- about fifty years ago.

Don't be embarassed, by the way -- everyone comes up with cyphers that
have been cracked before. However, I would suggest reading "The
Codebreakers" and the current literature before proposing new systems.
