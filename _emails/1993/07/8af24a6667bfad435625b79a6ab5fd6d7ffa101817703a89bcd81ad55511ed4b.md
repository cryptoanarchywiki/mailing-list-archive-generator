	Secure Clear (tm) Technology is the only...

	What's in a name?

	In this case, bullshit.

	I believe they do a simple frequency inversion, known in the
  `20's, easily defeated with a $15 kit added to one's scanner or for
  $5 in parts. Technology of the `20's packaged and named for the `90's.

	To quote a Canadian general, former commander of UN forces in
  Bosnia: "The UN doesn't have much in the way of communications. All
  we have is Motorola [radios]."
