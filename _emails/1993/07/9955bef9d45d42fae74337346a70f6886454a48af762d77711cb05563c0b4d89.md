	(kbits? kbytes?) Well, a quick check of some C code gets me
200Kbytes[*] (1.6Mbits) per second on a SparcStation ELC. I'll have
numbers for the i960 microcontroller[**] later this weekend -- you
might be able to have the microcontroller do the encryption too :-)

[*] That's 50,000 calls to des_ecb_encrypt and 50,000 calls to
des_ecb_decrypt, so 100K ecbs, each ecb is 8 bytes, so that's 800K
bytes, and it took 3.98 user CPU seconds, so that's 200K bytes. Yep,
the math checks. Compiler: Solaris gcc -O (a few months old); DES
code: Ferguson's, as folded into Kerberos 4.

[**] Yeah, it's marketed as a microcontroller. If you put it in a
toaster, you wouldn't need a heating element. Still, it's part of the
background for my talk at the Embedded Systems conference in October
on "Security Issues in Embedded Networking".
