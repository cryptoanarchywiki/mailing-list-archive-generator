I've had a couple of people ask to have their names added to the
encrypted list forwarder I put together.  I'm soliciting feedback on
how this service should work.

Right now, it only encrypts the "body" of the message.  The "headers",
which are the "From:" and "Subject:" lines, etc., are passed through
basically unchanged (except for "To:", which I change to be the person it
is going to.  Maybe that's unnecessary, as I notice that the cypherpunks
list puts its own address into "To:", for some reason.)  It also adds
"Encrypted: PGP" to the headers.

I wonder if it would be better for it to encrypt the whole message, headers
and body together, then to mail that with a fresh new header that would
show nothing about the original message.

The first approach hides the contents of the message, but not its subject
or who it is from; the second hides more.  Any suggestions as to which is
more useful?
