Dear Sir -- I am working on a project for NIST to develop an annotated 
bibliography on issues in the commercialization of encryption technology. Can 
you provide me with any references to EFF publications dealing with export, 
Clipper/Capstone, privacy, etc. ? I already have copies of the material 
presented at the CSS&PAB meeting at NIST but would like to have anything else 
that might be available. Thank you for your help!
