Why are we pointing out these flaws publicly? You should let them
pass, so that the flawed Clipper chips get widely deployed. THEN you
go in front of Malarkey's subcommittee and demonstrate to the whole
world how to intercept any Clipper-encrypted conversation without the
escrowed keys. Then just stand back and watch the fun begin.
