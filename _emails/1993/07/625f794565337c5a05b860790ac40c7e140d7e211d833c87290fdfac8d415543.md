I'm sorry I got sidetracked with the bit about dworkin.  I'm not
really even a serious supporter of hers.  On the other hand, I'm
probably one of the few people 'here' who've read most of her work.
Before one goes about believing many of the outrageous things
attributed to her, one should read her writing and take many of the
statements in context.  (Who was it a couple of years ago posting
summaries of out of context quotes by usenetters in alt.flame?)

At any rate, I was dismayed by Tim May's lack of knowledge regarding
the people he was attacking.  Wildly thrashing about and attacking
anyone who isn't completely on one's side tends to get one nowhere.

Again, I apologize for sidetracking things. 

-eric
