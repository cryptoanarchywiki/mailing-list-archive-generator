Both of those cost money.  If anonymous remailers cost a dime of
anonymous digital cash to use, people wouldn't use them quite as
often.  There would still be abuse, but random chronic abuse would be
much less.  Of course, if it cost money, people might not use them
when it was really necessary.  Not much can be done about that.
