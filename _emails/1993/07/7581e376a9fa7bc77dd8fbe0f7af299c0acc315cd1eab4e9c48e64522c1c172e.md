A while ago some one here (from England) mentioned a program he was
involved with that was an offline mail reader that allowed one to add
external protocols like PGP. He gave an FTP site (also in England).
The program was called something like APPNEWS. I downloaded it,
looked at it, and archived it until I could put time into installing
it with my connection and work out the bugs of dynamic addressing.
Now was the time, but I have lost the program. Please help me.

Perry queried earlier about what off-line readers people use. I use
Pop-mail and Eudora, but neither are really friendly with adding
externals. The problem I want to overcome is providing multiple users
on a single machine with security. Pop-mail and Eudora are designed to
be used by a single user and a personal (hopefully secure) machine.
The solution currently implemented is to have users save mail only to
floppy. Both mailers will create personal directories, but these can be
accessed both within and from outside the program. I would like to add
PGP (or another scheme) so that *all* saved messages (or ones so desired)
are encrypted. This would use the user's password and would be automatic.
