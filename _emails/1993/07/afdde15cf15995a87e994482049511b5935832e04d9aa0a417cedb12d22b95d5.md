  We just discussed a related issue on another list I subscribe to.  I
feel that we want accountability along with anonymity in many
circumstances.  You can deny service to 'bad apples' with out
compromising the identities of anyone who uses your service.  Not even
the identiy of the 'bad apple' need ever be know to you.  Chaum
discusses how this can be achieved cryptographicaly.  Is anyone
working on an implementation?
