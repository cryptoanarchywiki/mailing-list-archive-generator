Hm...something funny is going on here.  I test the remailers about
once every other week and generally here from all of them!  Can I try
sending mail to you through each remailer?  Maybe this will help
figure out the ones which can't reach you.

As far as I know, none of the remailers mail directly to newsgroups.
But, you can have them remail to an email-to-usenet gateway like
group-name@cs.utexas.edu.  There are others (pws.bull.com, decwrl's,
demon); I'll find my list and send it.
