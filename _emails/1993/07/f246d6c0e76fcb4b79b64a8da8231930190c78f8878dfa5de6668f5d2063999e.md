I dunno; if things change such that it's considered normal for users to
connect to local or outside SMTP and NNTP ports, that would seem to create
an convenient smokescreen/excuse for folks who use those ports for their
own (non-approved) ends. It'll be a lot harder to look through a log for
unknown connections.

See the discussion on comp.dcom.telecom about how difficult it is to
provide authentication of cellular phones and fraud prevention, while
allowing people to buy new phones easily, roam, and do all of that
other stuff that people do. I think the SMTP/NNTP/PINE/whatever stuff
is very similar - I think it may prove so difficult to truly authenticate
unknown and untraceable users that people will turn to other means for
identifying a few trusted machines/people/processes. Public-key crypto,
perhaps? :) Security and convenience are basically incompatible; I'm hoping
that we opt for convenience.
