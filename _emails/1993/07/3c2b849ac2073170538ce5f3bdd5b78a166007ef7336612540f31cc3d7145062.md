A friend of mine is in the T-shirt business...  he can 
take a GIF or other graphics file, print it on a color
printer, and heat-transfer it to a T-shirt.  Not quite 
as nice as silk-screen, but the set-up cost is much 
lower, especially for onesies.

Consider taking a paint program and, um, "rolling your
own" custom T-shirt design.  Perhaps run an official DARE 
poster through a color scanner and make suitable 
modifications.  If you're interested, I will ask him 
for details.
