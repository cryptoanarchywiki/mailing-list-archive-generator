I agree.. what if he posted it as some silly program in one of the 
sources groups, encrypted and all, with a description as something almost 
no one would want? then the worst that would happen is people flaming him 
for encrypting it.. that would be a way to go for a real post to convey 
information.. we could always create an alt.too.many.secrets (obligatory 
documentary movie reference =]) to post things to where there is a large 
audience, but for an audience of people who care about such issues, as 
opposed to a normal post which joe random user could argue with everyone 
without knowing the difference between a pgp encrypted and uuencoded 
file.

the other issue is that people will think what they want to think if 
they're uninformed, such as all of the people who flamed Tim for posting 
what's basically a worthless message, just that those people who flamed 
him didn't like the name of the group he posted it in.. for all we know, 
he could've posted his local /etc/hosts.
