Oh, come on. With all due respect (:-) I have to disagree. Why on Earth
have you to select this book?! Maybe you don't like
	A. Konheim "Cryptography: A Primer"

Or maybe you don't feel, that
	Meyer & Matyas "Cryptography. A New Dimension in Data Security"

covers enough of the field, at least for a beginner?

Or maybe there are no new goodies like
	G. Simmons "Contemporary Cryptology"

with lots and lots of annotated bibliography?

Indeed. One more reason to start with a real stuff (:-).

[Oh, of course, all the proper apologies for exhaling the
smoke and fire, and for misquoting (slightly, I hope) the
exact names of the books. :-]
