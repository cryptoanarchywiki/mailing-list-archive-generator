How about a valid debate being over **how** to best provide universal
service in this day & age of red-lining?  Interesting to note that when the
private entrepreneurs open up U.S. versions of the traditional European
"Call Offices," (rows of payphones with a window clerk or other attendant to
help provide service & security), all of a sudden a chorus of voices go up, 
"OH NO, the Dope Dealers will use these things!"  Well, one excuse or
another, same old racist BS either way.  The right to anonymity has got to
be universal, and the right to access has got to be universal, or these
things become mere privileges which can be taken away on a whim.
