BTW the year should be 1993.  This issue of Fringeware Review
has just been released.

Over the last few months I have noticed that Perry loses no opportunity
to say something negative.  It looks like you have a personality
problem, Perry.  Have you talked with your therapist lately?
 
Since you saw fit to post this criticism in public, I'll reply here.
 
1.  Many cypherpunks, being cypherpunks, are interested in "strange
publications" - especially those containing reports on the emerging
alternative culture - which you are apparently contemptuous of
(as of much else).
 
2.  If you've never heard of Fringeware then why display your ignorance?
 
3.  If you've never seen the article mentioned, and know nothing of
the author, on what basis do you claim that the author is without
credentials?  Because he publishes in a magazine with "Fringe" in
the title?  You're obviously prejudiced, Perry.
 
4.  Does it require an advanced degree in mathematics to write a clear
and lucid tutorial for those interested in using PGP?
 
5.  Is reading "a real text on cryptography" necessary in order to
learn to use PGP?  Your remark suggests it is, which is likely to
discourage people from using PGP rather than encourage them.
 
6.  Is the exchange of encrypted messages a branch of computer
science?  Why suggest that one has to study math to use PGP?
 
7.  Why don't you try to make a positive contribution to cypherpunks
instead of being continuously obnoxious?  I'm probably not the only
one here who thinks you're an asshole.
