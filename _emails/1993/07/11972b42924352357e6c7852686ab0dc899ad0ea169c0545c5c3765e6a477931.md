Could someone please define a 'data haven'?  I understand digitial 
cash, it is exactly what it sounds like.  However, in the context I've heard
data haven used in, then there is much more than simply keeping one's 
data encrypted on your local hard drive.

Still learning and trying to understand all of these things.
