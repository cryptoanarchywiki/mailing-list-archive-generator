As Eric Hughes suggested, I put together a little perl script to remail
cypherpunks mail, PGP encrypted, to all names on a list.  If you'd like
to receive your cypherpunks messages encrypted, send me your address and
your PGP key and I'll add you to the list.  Then you can unsubscribe from
the regular list.

I'll upload the script once I test it a little more.  Initial subscribers
should consider themselves alpha testers and feel free to complain.
