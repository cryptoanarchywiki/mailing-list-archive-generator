That would be realy cool! Sombody else (Eric I think) suggested maybe
buttons as well, and I've seen advertisements out in the net in various
news groups and such about 'cheap stickers' that you can get custom made,
like 100 for 15$US. Let's do _ALL_ of these ideas, and realy spread the word!

Happy Hunting, -Chris Odhner
