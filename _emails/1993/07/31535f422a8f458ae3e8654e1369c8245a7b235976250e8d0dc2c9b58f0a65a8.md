That is a good point too. Perhaps the laws and practices of Notary Publics
may serve for one degree of assurance. They commonly need to know who
is asking them to notarize something such as a will. I don't remember
how they do this.
I suppose that a Notary public should have a published public key that
she uses like her seal.
