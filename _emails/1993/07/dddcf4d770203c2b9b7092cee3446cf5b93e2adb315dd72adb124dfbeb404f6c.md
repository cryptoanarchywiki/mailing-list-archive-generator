People keep asking me for site addresses for PGP, so I figured it would be
more sensible to post this so everyone gets it.  There are of course many
more; these are just my "site", sites I know that have a large archive of
crypto files, and sites that get new releases of PGP almost instantly.

NitV-BBS +1-505-246-8515 N-8-2 1200-14000bps v32[b] v42[b] 24hr
soda.berkeley.edu  /pub/cypherpunks  mucho crypto
aql.gatech.edu  /pub/cypherpunks  many different platform Unix PGP execs
scr.doc.ic.ac.uk     gets new stuff quick
ghost.dsi.unimi.it         ditto


Hope that helps.  :)
