	If you don't think that talking to the public about what your
company is doing constitutes commercial activity, I have some friends in
the corporate media relations business who would be very interested to
know about that.

	I didn't say that it was reasonable, only that it was true.

	But I don't know of any providers which encourage people to send
traffic over government nets which violates government policies. As long
as the traffic stays within the commercial net, they're happy, but I don't
know of any provider that doesn't have a policy staing that its users must
follow the policies for any other networks that their traffic crosses.
Usenet posts will almost by definition cross all of the IP nets, so they
should conform to all of the acceptable use policies. 
	(So far as I know, this has never been enforced, but it's still
the rule.

	We aren't talking about Jim Bizdos. I agree that it's fair to
assume he speaks for PKP. But mail originating from a company machine
doesn't necessarily come from someone who speaks for the company.
