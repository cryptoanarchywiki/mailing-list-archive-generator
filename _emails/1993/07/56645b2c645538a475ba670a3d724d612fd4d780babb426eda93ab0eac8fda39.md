sounds line on paper, but how will it look on cotton after 30 washings.

yea, yea, does anyone care to just do thing for free anymore?  if there
are any profits they should go to Philip R. Zimmermann since his pgp
started this whole thing.  A large volume of the text on this list
was hot the RSA was trying to profit on encryption and who "we" did not
want to pay for it and how nice it is it to have good *free* software.

I suggest we sell the T's at cost.  there are enough of with jobs
that we can front the originator the startup costs.  Another advantage of
this is that more people will get the shirts.
