Note that the machine wasn't (only) an FTP server; it let anyone who
wanted get at a shell with compilers, debuggers, tools, etc., so that
the alleged Bad Guys from third world countries in a country with IP
connectivity on a student visa could run their nuclear bomb
design/simulation programs there....  never mind that the simulation
for the Manhattan Project was done with a horde of clerks, decks of
punched cards, and a big bunch of IBM card tabulators (see Feinmann's
autobiographies for more details..).

This looks annoyingly like a variant of the "initiative" a few years
back where the State Dept. wanted makers of high performance
workstations to export them only in a locked-down configuration
capable of executing only the applications they were originally
purchased to run; compilers need not apply...  fortunately, that died
a quick & quiet death.
