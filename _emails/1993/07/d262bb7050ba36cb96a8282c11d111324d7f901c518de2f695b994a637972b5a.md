with a DSP chip you can compress voice down to the
4.8kbps to 9.6kbps range with CELP
the 400 bps to 4800 bps range with LPC

If you have enough cycles and memory left over afterwards
you can do DES on the same DSP (depending on which brand you
choose this may or may not be feasible).

If you are using a host computer the computer can do
DES and framing for you.
