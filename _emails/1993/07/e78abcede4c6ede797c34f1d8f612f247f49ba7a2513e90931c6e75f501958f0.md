The attached message was originally posted in comp.dcom.telecom. I haven't
contacted these people, but some 'punk in the DC area might be able to
weasel in.

Consider the list of speakers:
	- well-known (notorious) - Denning, Bidzos, Clint Brooks from
	  NSA, Kammer from NIST
	- people we should be talking to - the mgr of AT&T's Secure
	  Comm Systems division, that same division's chief scientist
	- Big Wheels - Rosenthal (chief counsel for SPA), Willis Ware,
	  Jerry Berman.

Fun for the whole family!

-Paul

8:30-9:00 Registration

9:00-10:30 
CRYPTOGRAPHY OVERVIEW 

The basic concepts of cryptography and encryption, including
single-key and publickey, authentication, digital signatures, key
negotiation or distribution, and cryptanalysis (code breaking) will be
introduced along with the Data Encryption Standard (DES), the RSA
public-key system, and the Digital Signature Standard (DSS). The
speaker will also discuss the need for encryption and the role of
encryption in telephony and communications networks.

Dr. Dorothy E. Denning, Professor and Chair of Computer Science,
    Georgetown University

10:30-10:45 Coffee Break

10:45-11:45
SURVEY OF ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS 

The speaker will survey commercial hardware and software products that
contain encryption capabilities, including the types of products that
are available, their relative strengths and weaknesses, and the major
vendors.

Jim Bidzos, President, RSA Data Security, Inc.

11:45-12:30
CELLULAR ENCRYPTION

Cellular calls are especially vulnerable to eavesdropping. PrivaFone's
approach, which is interoperable on cellular and land lines, will be
described. Digital cellular standards that provide voice privacy and
authentication for TDMA or CDMA technologies also will be discussed.

Dr. Ming Lee, President, Synacomm Technology
Charles Wistar, President, PrivaFone Corp.

12:30-1:45 Hosted Lunch

1:45-2:30 
THE CLIPPER AND CAPSTONE CHIPS 

The Clipper and Capstone Chips are part of a new U.S. technology
initiative to provide secure communications and legitimate law
enforcement access through a key escrow system. The speakers will
describe the initiative, the security functions provided by the chips,
and the use of the Clipper Chip in the AT&T Telephone Security Device.

William M. Agee, Manager, Secure Communication Systems - Government, AT&T
Raymond G. Kammer, Acting Director, National Institute of Standards 
     and Technology

2:30-3:00
BUSINESS CONCERNS WITH ENCRYPTION 

The speaker will give a snapshot of one computer security program and
discuss business concerns with encryption, including practical needs
and requirements, organizational constraints, operational concerns,
security of the process, and balancing concerns and practical use.

Randolph N. Sanovic, Manager of Computer Security Planning, Mobil Corp.

3:00-3:15 Coffee Break

3:15-4:00
USING CRYPTOGRAPHY TO ARCHITECT DISTRIBUTED OPEN SYSTEMS
SECURITY: A CASE STUDY 

Securing networks and computers in a distributed environment presents
several new challenges. The speaker will describe Bell Atlantic's
enterprise-wide approach to architecting security in such an
environment, showing how encryption fits into the design.

Ravi Ganesan, Specialist, Security Research and Planning, Bell Atlantic

4:00-5:00
ENCRYPTION IN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND ELECTRONIC MAIL 

Encryption is becoming an integral tool for building secure
applications.  The speakers will discuss the use of encryption and
digital signatures in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Internet
Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM).

Michael S. Baum J.D., Principal, Independent Monitoring
Dr. Stephen D. Crocker, Vice President, Trusted Information Systems, Inc.

5:00-6:00 Reception


Wednesday, August 4, 1993

8:30-10:30
CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY IN THE U.S. 

The speakers will discuss the Clipper and Capstone chips, law
enforcement needs and the Digital Telephony proposal, export and
import of encryption products, international markets, industry growth
and competitiveness, and individual privacy. They will also report on
the national policy review in progress.
 
Dr. Willis H. Ware, Chair, Computer Systems Security and Privacy 
     Advisory Board (Moderator)
Jerry Berman, Executive Director, Electronic Frontier Foundation    
Clinton C. Brooks, Special Assistant to Director, National Security Agency

10:30-10:45 Coffee Break

10:45-11:30 CRYPTOGRAPHY IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY 

In the European Community, government controls on cryptography differ
across countries and affect achievement of secure open systems and,
consequently, achievement of the Open Market and transborder
electronic trading. The speaker will summarize the current situation
in Europe, describe some of the initiatives to address the issues, and
comment on the recent initiatives in the US.

Christopher E. Sundt, Business Strategy Manager, ICL Secure Systems

11:30-12:15
THE FUTURE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS 

Several fast-moving trends in telecommunications demand cryptographic
solutions, including wireless transmission, multi-media conferencing,
and electronic commerce.  As broadcast and multiple access
technologies are used increasingly for information transmission, and
everyday business is carried out in "cyberspace," structures that
ensure privacy, authenticity, and (often) anonymity must become part
of the natural landscape.

Dr. David P. Maher, Chief Scientist for AT&T Secure Communications 
     Systems, AT&T
