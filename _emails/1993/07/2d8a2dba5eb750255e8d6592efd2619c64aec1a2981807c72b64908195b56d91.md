I agree, we talked about the matchbook a while ago, what happened to that?
We should do:
Stickers, "nice" shirts, T-shirts, matchbooks, a wallet-card, and the Tatoos

Well, we got working on it and kept getting less and less feedback. The
last thing done on it was trying to get some type of cypherpunks logo

The latest of my ideas are available via ftp to ftp.u.washington.edu:
/pub/user-supported/cypherpunks/cpmatch.ps.Z

Other ideas I got we can discuss in email or if I get enough response, to
the list.
