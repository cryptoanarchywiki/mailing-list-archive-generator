just got a ton of mail regarding the Remailer abuse.  This wouldn't have 
anything to do with the loophole in the telnet sendmail port (25) would it.
 Thanx,

Ghabrech@ultrix.ramapo.edu

P.S. I heard that PGP version 2.1 was out.  I used gopher but could not find
it.  Which sites would have it?

Thanx again, L8R
