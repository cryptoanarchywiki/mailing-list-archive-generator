Matthew argues for balance in the USENET battle over pseudo/anonimity.
Matthew is preaching to the choir.

Folks who have watched USENET for any appreciable length of time know
that reason is not highly prized there.  Volume is.

The self-apponted gods of the net can't stop us, they can only bitch
about us.  Let them.

This is no different than any other USENET issue.  The only way to win
is not to play.
