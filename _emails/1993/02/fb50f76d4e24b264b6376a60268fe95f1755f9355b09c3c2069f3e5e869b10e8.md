There is also the problem of those (like me) who access the internet
from outside, through gates.  The messages are not only marked with the
point of origin automatically by the originating BBS's software, but are
also subject to monitoring by any number of systems operators en route
to internet.  When all of the headers (including passwords for the
anonymous servers) are in plaintext, the entire anonymous system seems
compromised.  While some servers I haven't tried yet seem to be PGPed,
this doesn't seem to be the case with penet.fi.

 BK> How about an EFF sponsored server?

Yes, and preferably at a site outside the US, just for good measure.
There is an obvious appeal to having servers outside the jurisdiction of
American law-enforcement busybodies.
