Definitely!

Unless you include your password in the message! Remember that
anon.penet.fi can pick up the X-Anon-To: and X-Anon-Password: lines from
the start of the message text - they don't have to be header fields.

The social implications are more important.

I repeat: for general postings, we have to come up with a way to provide
anonymity while retaining a return path. Otherwise chaos ensues, just
look at the most blatant misuses of anon postings witnessed recently!

Yeah... Haven't ben able to get away from my machine to have my morning
shower yet (it's 10:30am in Finland).
