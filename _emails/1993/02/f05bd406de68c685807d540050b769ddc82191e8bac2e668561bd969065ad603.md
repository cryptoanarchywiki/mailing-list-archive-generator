This is the message I received which complained about "inappropriate
use of the Internet".  He also phoned me to complain.

I know the cyperpunks already know this, but Dave Farber's audience
might not have thought about the implications for free speech of
having the government build a multi billion dollar Internet
replacement.  Bureaucrats and random complaints from third parties on
such a network *will* cause you grief about what you are allowed to
say and do.  The company I buy networking from is Alternet, and
because they exist, I can protect myself from this sort of meddling.
They will not be able to compete with the taxpayer funded "national
information infrastructure", and my only option, if I want to be on
the net, will be to hook up under the government's rules.

If after seeing this this exchange you still don't believe me, talk to
someone at a controversial broadcast radio station.  Radio is living
under that yoke *now*, and they have some real stories to tell.

John, below is the posting I called about.  In my opinion this is
inappropriate use of the Internet.  This person appears to be a virus
author, one who knows virus authors, and/or one who encourages such
activity. 

What is the policy of toad.com concerning such postings?

Keith

> polymorphic viruses is that they encrypt themselves with a different key
> each time they replicate (make a new copy of themselves).  The small
> amount of virus bootstrap code which is not encrypted is changed in each
> replication by dispursing random NOP's throughout the virus boostrap code.
> Thus each sample of polymorphic virus looks completely different to
> virus checking programs.  The virus checking programs cannot use
> "signature" byte strings to detect polymorphic viruses.

> I have seen something called D.A.M.E., also known as Dark Avenger
> Mutation Engine.  This is a freeware polymorphic library/kernel/toolkit
> which allows anyone to take an ordinary virus and wrap it in a polymorphic
> shell.  Thus each new copy of the virus will look completely different
> as it replicates.  D.A.M.E. is a great toolkit for those who want to
> release new viruses but don't have the skills to write a virus from
> scratch.  DAME works very well with Turbo Assembler and MASM.

> will be more powerful encryption, stealth capabilities, and compatibility

> Set, which will allow point-n-click building of new viruses using
> object oriented techniques.  It works sort of like a Mr. Potatohead,
> you point and click on the parts/modules you want and it builds it for
