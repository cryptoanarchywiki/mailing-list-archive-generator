I don't get it. The point of revocation is to remove a *compromised*
key, one that someone has potentially copied, etc.  If there is no
chance that the key can be accessed, how is this a problem? I guess the
problem is that only one key can be associated with one person
(identity) per keyring?  Then I would say the thing to do is propagate
the new key through the trust network in the same way it was originally
established...? This isn't really a deficiency in the software, is it?
