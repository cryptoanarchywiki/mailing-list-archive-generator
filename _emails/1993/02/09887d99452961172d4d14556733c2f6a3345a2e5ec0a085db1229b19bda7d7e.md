Yes, this is a REAL danger. But if the network providers will
charge per-packet fee (what an ugly idea :-), and no packet
will be moved without being "taxed" (:-) - i.e. some
digital cash removed from it's header (:-) - well,
I see no reason, why somebody can't invest his
$1,000,000 in shutting y'all up for a day (:-).

It only depends on who pays for each packet (:-).

Yeah, THIS can be a problem: our Big Brother has enough
money to do all the smelly things we discussed above...
And if not - he'll tax us more...

There's no way to limit Big Brother's power, except
for getting rid of him altogether, I'm afraid...
