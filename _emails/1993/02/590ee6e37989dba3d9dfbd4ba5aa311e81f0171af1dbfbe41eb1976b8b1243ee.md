Penet.fi will be PGP:s as soon as I get PGP running reliably on the
Interactive UNIX system I use. This weekend, I hope... But if you all
keep coming up with other new features I have to add, I don't know how
long it's going to take. And I have to upgrade the hardware as well,
the load is getting so big the current server is running out of both CPU
and disk. This weekend I will upgrade to a 486SX motherboard and a
bigger disk.

Yeah, seems that (and the fact that I have 100% control not only of the
site but of the network as well) is what has kept anon.penet.fi up this
long...
