ahh..  I just thought of something I should mention about that
code I have sent out.  I am releasing MY CODE to the public domain,
but parts of the package are not mine :)   In particular the 
RSA code and the DES code come from other places.  I dont think
there are any restrictions on the code, but they dont become
public domain with my code :)   Lets keep me out of trouble
