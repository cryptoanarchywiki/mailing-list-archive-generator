I've been playing with NUpop, (a PC program) and am impressed with it.
It would help bring PGP to the masses, except that currently the source
is not available. The author says that supporting external filter programs
is on his list, but it is a long list.

The home FTP site for nupop is casbah.acns.nwu.edu in the /pub/nupop
directory. Current field release is nupop103.zip, with nupop110.zip
in 'beta' stages. It is widely available - ask archie.

While I really like NUpop, unless the sources become available, or
the priority of external filters gets higher on the list, we need
to look elseware. 

Can someone with experience with Eudora for the PC give a short review?

Thanks
Pat
