I've got a NeXTstation colour and am dabbling with the various tools that are  
available for electronic encryption.  As you may know, NeXT developed a Fast  
Elliptical Encryption system (FEE) based on public key technology, but was  
prohibited from exporting it due to US law; so the dropped the tool from  
their NeXTmail system which was set for International distribution.

I have however found PGP recently (but can not get it to compile; I'm no  
programmer so I'm just bumbling throug the code fixing what I can by trial  
and error, not wise, I know), and a few other tools (kerberos)...

I'd be interested in hearing from anyone else who is using any form of  
encryption on their NeXTs for electronic mail, how they implemented it, what  
they see as alternatives and so on.

Ta,
Scott
