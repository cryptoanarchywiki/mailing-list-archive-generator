Well, I hereby volunteer anon.penet.fi for such use. I already have the
posting stuff in place, and .fi is outside US jurisdiction.... It would
be a one-line hack to disable the anon id generation for posters to that
group... So the security concerns re anon.penet.fi mentioned on this list
wouldn't apply... 

Now I only have to get PGP up on the damned Interactive UNIX... Or
switch to bsd/386 or something...
