:"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what Steve
:Jackson Games did, what it was?" asked Sparks. "An hour?
:
:"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to Steve
:Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything taken?
:
:"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had a
:picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen --
:saying he was a computer crime suspect?
:
:"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material could
:harm Steve Jackson economically?"
:
:Foley replied, "No, sir," but the judge offered his own answer.
:
:"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go out
:and hire a lawyer and sue you."

This particular exchange makes me warm & tingly inside... :-)


:"Agent Foley, it's been almost three years. Has Chris Goggans been
:indicted? Has Loyd Blankenship been indicted? Has Loyd Blankenship's
:computer been returned to him?"

No, it hasn't. <sigh> Hopefully this will motivate them to return it. While
I can't get too excited about the then state-of-the-art 286 system, I'd
*really* like the laser printer back, and Whitney wants her papers returned.
