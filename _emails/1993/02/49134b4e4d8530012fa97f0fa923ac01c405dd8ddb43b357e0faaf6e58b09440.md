I'm sick and tired of all the virus hoo-hah myself.  The only "anti-virus
software" a hacker needs is DEBUG.  And maybe your favorite sector editor
utility, like DISKEDIT.  Anything more, and you're an embarassment.
Why don't you just send your life savings to McAfee while you're at it.
I could go and quote P. T. Barnum right now, but I think my point is made.
