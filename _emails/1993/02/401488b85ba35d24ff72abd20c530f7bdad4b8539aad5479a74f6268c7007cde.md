Yawn.  CYBERPUNK: Virtual sex, smart drugs and synthetic

Sure, but do they know how to set their umask values so that
people can't peek?  La-de-dah, let's check on one of the gurus...
(BTW, if you enjoy this, & you can get on the WELL, try some
of the other cyberpunk.gods from B. Sterling on.  Not that
they have anything much of interest....)
