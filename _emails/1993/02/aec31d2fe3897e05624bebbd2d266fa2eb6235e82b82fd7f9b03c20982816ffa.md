This is a typical example of the dilemmas faced by an anon posting
operator. Here is my reply to the complaint from an user in
rec.music.gdead. Don't feel good about it, but...

I have sent the person a message informing him/her that the account will
be blocked if the inappropriate postings continue. In an international
world, where laws, customs and morals vary from one place and culture to
another, and where a lot of people are trying to force their views onto
others, the only way a service like anon.penet.fi can operate is by very
simple and firm rules that are followed without exception. One rule is
that I *never* reveal the true identity of an anon user, and another is
that I *never* block access to the server without warning and without
giving the person a chance to defend him/herself.

I do understand your views, and I am very sympatetic to them, but I hope
you also realize that inpartial service requires "blind" abiding to
these rules.

	Julf
