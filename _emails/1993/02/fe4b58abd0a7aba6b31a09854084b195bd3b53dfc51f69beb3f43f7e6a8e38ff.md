I don't know why this is happening -- my messages are being sent with
headers

    To: anon@anon.penet.fi
    X-Anon-To: cypherpunks@toad.com

Yet two copies are arriving, one from "an5877@anon.penet.fi (deadbeat)"
and another from "nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu (Anonymous)."  Personally, I
think the latter remailer is broken.
