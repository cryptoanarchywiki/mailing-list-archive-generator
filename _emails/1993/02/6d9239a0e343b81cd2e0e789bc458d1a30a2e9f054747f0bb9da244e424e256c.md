I was in a meeting where the license manager technology was explained from
a semi-technical, semi-business point of view.

 o  There's a standard that many companies are using.  It's for the rpc
    interface between licensed programs and license managers.  The
    program calls the manager, tells it a couple things, and asks,
    is it okay for me to run?

 o  License managers vary in the kinds of licenses they can support.
    There's enough variety of license possibilities to make your
    head swim.

 o  License managers generally work from "licenses," which are text files
    on your computer that describe the terms of particular licenses in a 
    license-manager-specific language.

 o  I think they use RSA, MD5, etc., for instance in signing logs that they
    keep.

 o  License-managers are themselves expensive and licensed, with a variety
    of up-front/per platform/per site/per end user/per developer license 
    combinations as well as the feature variety I mentioned.

I could probably find out what public documents exist if nobody else on the
list knows.
