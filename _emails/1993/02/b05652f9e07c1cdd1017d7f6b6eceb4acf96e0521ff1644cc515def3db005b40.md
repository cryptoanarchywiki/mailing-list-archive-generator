Alternet is part of the Internet. There is no central control on the
internet -- only on segments of it.

UUCP is even more anarchic...

The NSF NET has policy statements. There are no policies for the internet
and indeed given that the internet spans at least thirty or so national
jurisidictions and tens of thousands of different networks its impossible
to have one policy statment. The risk is that Al Gore and Company will
manage to ram through their goverment managed internet which would
put PSI and company out of business and which would permanently assure
that most traffic passes through zones with draconian policies.
