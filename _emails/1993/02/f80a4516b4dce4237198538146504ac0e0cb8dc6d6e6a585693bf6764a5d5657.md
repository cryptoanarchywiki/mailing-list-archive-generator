I think we should come up with a more socially acceptable solution.
Widespread use of hit-and-run abuse on the net would certainly lead to
actions against sites such as anon.penet.fi. Some method that preserves
a return path is needed for a *general* posting facility
(alt.whistleblowers etc. would be special cases). And... Please remember
anon.penet.fi has something like 13000 existing users. And most of them
have been using other anonymous posting hosts with the same
limitations/defaults as anon.penet.fi. So we can't change everything
overnight...
