I'm worried that the "serious bug" might be that the system won't  
prevent the gullible from mailing "deadbeat" their e-mail addresses  
through penet.  Once they've done that, he can "piece together" their  
anonymous IDs and email addresses quite easily.

I hope I'm wrong about this, though...
