Well, I don't agree that doubleblind is a great idea.

For example, if at any time, Alice sends pseudonymously to Bob, Bob can
not reply directly: this would expose his identity at anon.penet.fi.
Bob must reply through a remailer.

Note the irony -- Bob must take special steps to protect his pseudonym
because anon.penet.fi is acting affirmatively to conceal his actual
identity.  If Bob slips up and simply replies, he is exposed.

Actually, I don't know why my message went through a Cypherpunks
remailer -- I didn't ask it to.  I don't know of any weaknesses in
the Cypherpunks remailers (other than extreme vulnerability to social
engineering).

I think it's imperative that the sender use X-Anon-To to be
pseudonymous.  This is consistent with the principle of least
astonishment.

A Cypherpunks remailer can be used to conceal the correspondent's
pseudonymous identity.

It would be a real boon to make pseudonyms less prominent -- this
seems to have kicked over a hornet's nest on USENET (even though
pseudonyms have been quietly in use for years).  But were this the
case, scrutiny would be an understatement.

I agree that more discussion is in order.  I'm especially concerned 
about the broader issues regarding anonymity through remailers.
