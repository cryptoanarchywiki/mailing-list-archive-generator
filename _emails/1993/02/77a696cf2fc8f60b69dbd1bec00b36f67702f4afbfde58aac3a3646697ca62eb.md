]     Well this is completely useless, isn't it.. If we imagine this

The White House E-Mail gambit is a gimmick without substance.  One -
according to a previous Cypherpunks post, the e-mail isn't getting
through; two - they want mailing addresses for acknowledgement, which is
absurd for any number of obvious reasons (take your pick or come up with
your own); finally (this is the _real_ kicker), tonight's news informs
me that the Clinton White House is making a "symbolic" cost-cutting
gesture by reducing staff "up to 25%."  Where will these reductions come
from?  "The reductions will come mostly from staff whose job is to
respond to mail from the public."
     This hoax is the biggest joke since Rush Limbaugh gave out his
CompuServe address.  A collective Cypherpunk e-letter to Slick?  Let's
not & say we did...[yawn!]
