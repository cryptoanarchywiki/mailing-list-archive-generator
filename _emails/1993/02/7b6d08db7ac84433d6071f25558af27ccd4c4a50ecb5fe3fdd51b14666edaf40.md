Excellent idea. I am a government official who has blown the whistle on 
several major abuses, and have trusted friends in the media. I can see 
to it that if alt.whistleblowers becomes real, it will be read.

Submissions should be to a mailbox that renders the articles anonymous 
before they go public. There might be an alt.whistleblowers.d for 
discussion where members of the press could (here's where crypto-tech 
comes in) post requests for further information. PGP (or whatever) sigs 
could serve as press "credentials" and interested reporters could post 
their public keys to a trusted repository.

This has a lot of merit.

Since we know that the press is the only effective means by which a tale 
of government abuse can be told, this could change the way government 
does business, knowing that honest people have nothing to fear by 
pointing out the crooks. I've seen it happen ... makes you feel good.
