 BK> Currently, Jock Gill is
 BK> working in an office located in the Old Executive Office Building
 BK> across the street from the White House.  At this point, he is
 BK> working alone, without a staff.

This week's news indicates to me this will probably not improve.

 BK> The White House itself employs a large
 BK> staff to handle snail mail.

According to Monday night's news, this is from where these vaunted
"symbolic" 25% White House staff cuts will come.

 BK> All things in their time.  Once the
 BK> E-mail address was circulated together with the heading the "White
 BK> House", everyone understandably believed a real system was up and
 BK> running.

Yes, silly us...particularly with the "CLINTON" AOL address.

 BK> SUGGESTION:  Use the compuserve address you have judiciously,
 BK> reserving it for absolutely vital contacts.

Oh, yes, _certainly_!  The _vital_ stuff should go into a nonexistant
system.  Naturally!

 BK> Until such time that a
 BK> real public access White house E-mail system is operational,

 BK> possible--to get an interactive system up and running.  But it will
 BK> take time and patience.

Can anyone say, "VAPORWARE"?

Pass it around?  You bet.  It's f*cking _hilarious_!  My guess is that
this gaffe will (or at least ought to) get Gill fired, assuming he
survives this "symbolic" staff downsizing.  I might add that nothing
could be more "symbolic" than the announcement that the cuts will come
from those who actually respond to public input.  This "go away & don't
bother us" move on the part of the Clinton administration indicates that
it obviously doesn't care _what_ America thinks.
.   There is a _bright side_ to this, however:  Would such an
indifferent administration spend resources trying to break our codes
when it doesn't care what we have to say anyway? 8-)
