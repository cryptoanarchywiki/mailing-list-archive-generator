Keith,
	Maybe you should read more carefully...

I think John is the "intended recipient of such communication"
as I am also an "intended recipient" of this communication 
from you, which I will post to cypherpunks so others can see
what kind of person you are.  If your intention is to "threaten"
with this kind of foolishness, then I must warn you, I consider
this type of behavior harassment due to the confrontive nature of 
your post.  Let it go on record that I don't expect to be harassed,
intimidated or "threatened" and I think the Internet rules are
VERY clear about this type of behavior.
