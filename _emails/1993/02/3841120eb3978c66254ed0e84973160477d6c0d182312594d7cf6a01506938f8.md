     "What does the Federal Intelligence  Community Fear"


#1. President Bush in a little notice move during the height of the
Iraq war had a ceratin statute in the vast body of
(un)LAW that compromise the National Security Act.
It became a violation of that same act to publish a
photo or information about a federal intelligence community member.
Thus all their actions are effectively hidden from view. With
anonymous posting and forwarding mechanisms it becomes easily for 
whistle-bloweres and Political activists to circumvent that
antithesis to the 1st amendment of the constitution and
expose all of the hidden plots of a vastly overbearing federal bueracracy
 The Federal Government knows this fact as their actions regarding
cryptography for the past 40 years shows it. Cryptography has a very
REAL world effect in exposing corruption while preventing
or inviting retribution from those selfsame federal lawbreakers
Truly anonymous posting/forwarding networks being totally beyond their ability
to coerce/interdict or penetrate scare the living hell out of them.
Imagine a SUNDEVIL type federal operation(witchhunt) where ALL
of the defendents email/posting are either encrypted or anonymized
:) it would pose some very hard problems for the investigators(witchunters)



   what are your thoughts?

   cheers
   kelly
p.s. Imagine an federal investigation where the investigators
became the investigated with the help of anonymous networks
digitized video clips and photos and easily obtainable/
publicly available investigative Databases
oops is this forbidden speech also???
 better watch what I say the Godamn US ARMY may be listening!!
