Cypherpunks, this is an experiment we can try right here right now.
We certainly have the anonymous mail facilities, pools, and
encryption, as well as a digital bank we could use to "pay" people :-)

Splitting a decryption key is fairly easy: we could use the simple XOR
method.  Say you want to encrypt a message of length m and split the
key among n people.  Choose n-1 sequences of m random bits (coin
flips, cryptographically strong pseudo-random number sequences, etc)
and XOR the message with all the random sequences (call the result
M').  Then your split secret is the M' and the n-1 sequences.  To
recover the message, calculate the XOR of M' and the n-1 sequences.
Providing for an n-out-of-m scheme takes more work and number theory,
but that can be done as well.
