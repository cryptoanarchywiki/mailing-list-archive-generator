             FROM THE VIRTUAL DESK OF SANDY SANDFORT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm relatively new to the list, so this may be an idea that's
already been dealt with.  If so, please let me know off-line.

PGP was created as an end-run to legislation that would have
mandated trapdoors in all encryption hardware/software sold in
the U.S.   Fortunately, such legislation has been defeated to
date.

How do we know the proposed legislation wasn't just a smoke
screen?  Isn't it possible that the Feds have already compromised
Intel or MicroSoft?  Is there some way to be sure that the new
486 chip running your computer isn't recording each PGP or RSA
private key you generate?
