Well, while I am personally of the opinion that this undertaking is of
neglible value for the sweat expended anyway, I would suggest that the
eventual note (if any) not presume to represent anyone but the
individual signatories.

 BK> On the other hand I am repenting my suggestion that we _might_ include
 BK> anything political in our missive.

Good.  The surreal laundry-list of crackpot causes in CPSR's written
agenda has gained them my absolute opposition & has probably turned off
others as well.  It would be a mistake for Cypherpunks to drag in
outside issues.

 BK> I don't think it should be "cutesy"

Of course not.  There's no quicker way to the bit bucket, assuming this
entire e-mail flap isn't a bad joke in the first place.

 >>Stress privacy, and technological defenses thereto.

 BK> I agree.

Me three.

 BK> Especially the technological expertise side, as this is what
 BK> differentiates us from the mass of other people crying about privacy.

A good point!  Nothing impresses bureaucrats like "experts" [cough!].

 >>5) Offer to help.  Offer to make timely review of proposed policies.
 >>If they accept your aid, keep your promises.

 BK> This is my favorite suggestion. Imagine if they gave us all jobs at
 BK> the NSA. Heh-heh-heh.

You wouldn't like it.

 BK> Now, I have a general question: what is the current status of the

 BK> had a response yet, by email or snailmail? Is there a possibility that
 BK> this IS a hoax and that we should just send paper mail instead?

Check my previous message.
