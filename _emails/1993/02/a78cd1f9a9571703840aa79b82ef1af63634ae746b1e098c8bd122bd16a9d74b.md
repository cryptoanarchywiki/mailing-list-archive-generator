Sheesh. I guess you just have to stand back and admire this level of
paranoia.
Can we establish a 'Cypherpunks Paranoia Achievement Award' for this?

Shortly thereafter Sandy sez: "Hey, wait a minnit... just _why are you voting
for ME?"

Technically, Kelly G.'s suggestion notwithstanding, I think this is
definitely a computationally-impossible task. However: in a very specific
circumstance, such as some foreign spook who's already under surveillance by
the feds, I suppose it's possible to create a one-time special chip that
might record keystrokes (or transmit them to a van, etc.) and then be
replaced *physically* with a replacement. The intelligence necessary to
coordinate an operation such as this, however, is pretty involved.
Personally, since I have NO interest in offing the President, I doubt they're
gonna bother with me.

Not only that, but also this: imho, it's more than _probable_ that the Feds
have compromised both Intel & Microsoft, but, as the old Polish saying goes:

     "You can put your shoes in the oven, but that don't make 'em biscuits."
