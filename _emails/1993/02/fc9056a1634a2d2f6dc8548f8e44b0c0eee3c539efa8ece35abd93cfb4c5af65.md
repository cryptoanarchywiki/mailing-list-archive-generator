If you are involved with recreational or educational software, I
can assist you or your company to distribute it overseas.  I have
a very aggressive, very reliable business associate in Singapore,
who would like to distribute your computer game and educational
software throughout South East Asia.

If you would like to know more, let me know and I will get in

profitability of your software products.
