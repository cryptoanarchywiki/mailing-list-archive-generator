Dear ld231782,

I believe that a good letter to the President has _one_ theme.  If
it comes out to more than one, write more than one letter.

My own emphasis would be on computer security concerns, and the legitimate
privacy, anonymity, and electronic-cash interests of Internetters.  Aren't
these the issues which bring us together as cypherpunks?

p.s.  Here are two draft letters for your consideration.

Dear President Clinton,
   Bring democracy to the bits!  Let's take a vote among all the bits 
   to decide which value, 0 or 1, is most correct.  Then we can set all
   bits to that value and they will all be equal!
Best regards,  The Cypherpunks (Socialist Subgroup).

Dear President Clinton,
   Freedom for the bits!  We will not rest until each bit is free to
   determine its own natural orientation without outside coercion.  The
   good news is, you don't need to do anything at all; merely get out of
   the way of the free market, and the bits will free themselves.
Best regards,  The Cypherpunks (Anarchist Subgroup).
