I'm sure this isn't the right place for this question, but what the hell.   
I've added a second mailing address to my public key, but this causes a  
validity error (unknown sigantor) when checked with -kc.  


How can I go about making that go away so that people who check will not be  
greeted by this message?  


Only been in PGP a week,
Scott
