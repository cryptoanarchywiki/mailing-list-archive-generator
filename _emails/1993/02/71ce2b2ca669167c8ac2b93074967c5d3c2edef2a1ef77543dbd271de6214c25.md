Todd,

I am not able to mail you with the answer to your query as your mailer just  
said you were todd@imaginatio which is something less than complete...if you  
can mail me (S.A.McIntyre@durham.ac.uk) with your complete mail address, I  
can tell you how to get PGP working on the NeXT...I've been playing with it  
all afternoon!

Scott
