All of Hal's quesions are excellent, but I'm afraid he's asking the
wrong people.  The people we should be asking are people like Rick
Adams and Bill Schraeder, since utimately, it is people like them who
decide whether or not to sell their service to any given site in the
face of unpopular activites.  If any of you actually buy network
service from these guys, drop them a note and ask!
