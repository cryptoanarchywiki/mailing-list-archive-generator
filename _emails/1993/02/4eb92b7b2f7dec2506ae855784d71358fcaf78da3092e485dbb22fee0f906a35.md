Subject: Anonymous pool created

The pool is basically a mailing list with automatic maintenance.
The intention is that you add a reply-to: header to your anonymous
mail (or mention it somewhere in your mail) pointing at the
pool address.  Make sure that your correspondent put some identifying
marks on the reply (like encrypting it with your public key, and/or
putting your pseudonym on the Subject: line) so you can tell it apart
from the rest.  Of course, you should first subscribe to the pool.

Your anonymous reply address you should mention is:
	pool0@extropia.wimsey.com

All admin requests (handled by a program):
	pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com

All problems to:
	miron@extropia.wimsey.com

The following Subject: lines are recognized:

subscribe
unsubscribe
help

and others - described in the help file.  Matching is actually quite
loose, so don't worry about whitespace or anything like that.

Experiments are welcome.
