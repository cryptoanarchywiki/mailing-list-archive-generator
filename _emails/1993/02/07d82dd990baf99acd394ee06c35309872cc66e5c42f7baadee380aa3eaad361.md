I don't believe this. You can buy data feeds that give you instant market
data, rather than 15 minute delayed information. I've worked for
operations like Morgan Stanley's Analytic Proprietary Trading Group,
and although I've seen some neat tricks applied to market data, I've
never heard tell of Shannon developing any, nor is there any delay
in the data such groups use for trading.
