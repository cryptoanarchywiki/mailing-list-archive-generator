It occured to me that some people might not get the significance of all
this, so prehaps I ought to amplify. 

With the ability to compress speech down into the
same baud rate as, say, a V.32 modem, all one would have to do to have
perfectly secure voice communications is replace your phone with a
setup that took in your speech, digitized it, compressed it, encrypted
it, and sent it over the modem to the other side where this would be
inverted. Fast enough software compression of voice would mean any PC 
with a DSP card and a V.32 modem could become an unbreakable scrambler.
The chief problem is that the DSP needed to do decent compression is
very crunchy, and encryption also tends to be crunchy, so there aren't
typically enough cycles on your average PC. Of course, were someone to
commercially market a board that did all this in hardware...
