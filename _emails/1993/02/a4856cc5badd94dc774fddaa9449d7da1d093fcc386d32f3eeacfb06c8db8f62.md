It's not so much the advertising I object to, but all the
"conversation" that gets repeated each time the issue comes up.  Give
it a rest.  Stay on the topic.  Keep your laser handy.

Anyone get very far with the CELP stuff yet?  I forget: is it or isn't
it "acceptable use" to implement Diffie-Helman in code you don't sell?
What if you sell it later?  At what point do you need to license it?
