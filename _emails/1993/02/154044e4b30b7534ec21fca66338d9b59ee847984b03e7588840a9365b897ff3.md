A new Request for Comments is now available in online RFC libraries.


        RFC 1422:

        Title:      Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail:
                    Part II: Certificate-Based Key Management      
        Author:     S. Kent
        Mailbox:    kent@BBN.COM
        Pages:      32
        Characters: 86,085
        Obsoletes:  RFC 1114 


This is one of a series of documents defining privacy enhancement
mechanisms for electronic mail transferred using Internet mail
protocols.  This memo is the outgrowth of a series of meetings of the
Privacy and Security Research Group of the Internet Research Task
Force (IRTF) and the Privacy-Enhanced Electronic Mail Working Group of
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The author would like to
thank the members of the PSRG and the PEM WG for their comments and
contributions at the meetings which led to the preparation of this
document.  The author also would like to thank contributors to the
PEM-DEV mailing list ("pem-dev@tis.com") who have provided valuable
input which is reflected in this memo.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@CNRI.RESTON.VA.US.  Requests to be added
to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should be sent to
RFC-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.

Details on obtaining RFCs via FTP or EMAIL may be obtained by sending
an EMAIL message to "rfc-info@ISI.EDU" with the message body 
"help: ways_to_get_rfcs".  For example:

        To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
        Subject: getting rfcs

        help: ways_to_get_rfcs

Requests for special distribution should be addressed to either the
author of the RFC in question, or to NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL.  Unless
specifically noted otherwise on the RFC itself, all RFCs are for
unlimited distribution.

Submissions for Requests for Comments should be sent to
