I was thinking of installing a trivial hack in my remailer, such that
upon demand it adds some random (essentially unrepeatable) cruft to
the From: line, placing it as a name field so as to have no
addressing significance.  I believe penet assigns IDs based on this
line, so chaining this to a penet-style remailer would provide
"hit-and-run" anonymity -- even if the remailer wants nothing of the
sort.  The social desirability of this could be questioned, but it
certainly seems more secure to built pseudonyms on top of something
like this (using PGP sigs to provide a solid identity) than through
the presently-popular approach.  Comments?  (Julf?)
