I refer you to Warren on this.  It was my understanding of the article
that Hellman had actually decrypted DES cyphertext prepared with the
then-proposed 54-bit key standard.

Please, there's no need for abuse here.  I was referring to a published
column by Jim Warren of the Electronic Frontiers Foundation in
_MicroTimes_, a Bay Area computer paper.  I do not know if you consider
Warren or the EFF to be reputable.  I assumed Warren's statements were
factual.  The assertion that Israeli intelligence made short work of DES
was presented as I got it - an interesting rumor from someone who has
been a fairly-reliable source of information in the past.

I was merely relating published assertions by the EFF.  If you believe
these to be incorrect, then I'd advise you to take the issue up with
Warren.  I have no "opinion" in the matter, only suspicions.  A great
many people with academic background superior to mine also share these.
My own background is in applied rather than theoretical security.  I
defer to academics in academic matters, but know that in matters of top
security it is difficult to invest confidence in any mechanism as mired
in continuing controversy as DES.  That's all.
