 My apologies for strayiing even further from the topic, but
 Phyber's comments would not let me let this sleeping dog lie.
 
 Strictly using DEBUG is a bit ridiculous for the "masses", but I
 can understand your sentiment, at least to that end. As far as
 I'm concerned, I can isolate _any_ change in my operating
 environment (be it DOS, Novell NOS, UNIX or whatever, for that
 matter) with the utilities that accompany the operating system
 (and of course, a couple of home-brewed ones to boot). Viruses
 are simply nuisances, for those who are adept enough to bop
 around in assembly code.
 
 Your disdain for "anti-virus software" is shared by many -- even
 shared by myself, to a certain degree. Every time I read an
 advertisement in a trade rag that boasts, "Can now find and eradicate
 new and unknown viruses!" or "Now! Can kill the deadly Mutation
 Engine virus!", I can only shake my head and snicker.
 
 However, there are a couple of genuine "good guys" out there in
 computer land that produces some excellent "anti-virus" software.
 Dr. Alan Solomon (UK) and Fridrik Skulason (Iceland), both of whom I
 know personally, produce perhaps the most effective and timely virus
 detection software in the business. Yes, they both will tell you that
 they use DEBUG to trace code and disassemble.
 
 Sara told me that you were rather impetuous. ;-)
 
 Further discussions relating to thhis topic should be moved to
 comp.virus (virus-l@lehigh.edu) or directed to me by email.
