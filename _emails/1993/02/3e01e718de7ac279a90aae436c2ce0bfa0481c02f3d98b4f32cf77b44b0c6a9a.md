This is not very likely.  There would be several problems for anyone
attempting this.  First, where do you store it?  On-chip non-volatile
memory?  Second, how would the chip know that it was generating
a private key?  This would almost require artificial intelligence. 
You can't just scan for a sequence of instructions currently used
by PGP, for they change with each version released.  Or would it
store ALL data that passes through it?  Third, how useful would
that be?  What if you generate your keys on a sub-notebook computer 
which you carry with you or store in a secure place at all times.

So, no, this is not something you need to worry about.
