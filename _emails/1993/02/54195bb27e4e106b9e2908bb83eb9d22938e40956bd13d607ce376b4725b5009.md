...and thus the government's decision to consider PGP (a privacy mechanism)
as "munitions." At first I thought it was outrageous, but it all makes
curious sense somehow when you bop yourself on the head the right way,
doesn't it?

I say we should ensure that as many citizens as possible get ahold of PGP as
soon as possible. After all, the NRA would have us believe that it's every
citizen's right to "bear arms," so why shouldn't we (especially those who
choose not to carry firearms like me) all have whatever sort of weapon we
choose to "carry?"

That's all for now, excuse me while I go hurl. All this crap really makes me
a bit ill, to tell you the truth. I only want the same respect I give to
other people, not a lot of static from a bunch of haircuts with sidearms.

PS: Keep this in mind the next time you see someone you love patronize a
Rambo-style movie or play a game of shoot-'em-up Ninten
do - this is where the Bad Guys get their funding, lads.
