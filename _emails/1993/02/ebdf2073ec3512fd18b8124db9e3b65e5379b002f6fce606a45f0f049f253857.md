No. The To: shows the real receiver, X-Anonymously-To: shows the address
the message was originally sent to. Thus you know if the message was
sent to your anonymous or real address.

Agree. Here is the anon.penet.fi set:

	X-Anon-To:	 - set by user, stripped by server
	X-Anon-Password: - set by user, stripped by server
	X-Anonymously-To: - set by server
