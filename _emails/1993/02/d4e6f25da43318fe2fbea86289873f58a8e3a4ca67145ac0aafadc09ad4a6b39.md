I think this would be fixed by the "X-Anon-Anonymize: no" (or whatever)
hack. But for reasons I have outlined in the earlier round of
discussions, it can't be the default. Comments?

Definitely. I might block someone from using the server, but never (ok,
"never say never") expose somebody.

It fixes *one* problem. I really appreciate suggestions for other
solutions.

There has been a lot of discussion about this, and I'm afraid it's too
late to change the *default* behavior now...

True. And that's why PGP-based stuff & remailer chains is the way to go
for "hard" anonymity. But for posting to general newsgroups, we also
need a system with working return paths. This doesn't seem possible with
current remailer chain systems.

P.S. In case I forgot to announce it, as you could see from the message
I'm replying to, PGP stuff doesn't get stripped at anon.penet.fi
anymore.....
