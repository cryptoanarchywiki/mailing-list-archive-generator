Subject: I've had many requests for this, so here it is.
Message-ID: <Pine.3.05.9302022028.A12526-c100000@stein.u.washington.edu>

These are the instructions for the remailer set up on one of my accounts,
dubbed the 'phantom remailer' by some. These instructions are available by
fingering phantom@mead.u.washington.edu. 

Recently I had problems with the receiveing and decryption of encrypted
PGP messages, but everything is functional now. 

Please note the syntax: if you don't include the '::'s, the message will
end up in my mailbox! (this goes for all remailer systems).

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----


If you wish to bounce anonymous mail (remail):
- ----------------------------------------------
include the line "Request-Remailing-To: <user@host>" in the mail 
header, then the body of the message will be forwarded to the recipient.

- -or-
include the lines

::
Request-Remailing-To: <user@host>

in the body of the mail message, of which the rest of message will 
be forwarded to the recipient.


If you wish to send encrypted mail to remail:
- ---------------------------------------------
include the line "Encrypted: PGP" in the mail header, then the body
will be decrypted and searched for the above-mentioned convention for
finding the recipient.

- -or-
include the lines

::
Encrypted: PGP

in the body of the mail message, of which the rest of the message will
be decrypted and searched for the above-mentioned convention for finding
the recipient.

Recently, I was having problems with the encryption part of the remailer, 
but that has been fixed. The remailer phantom@mead.u.washington.edu is now
fully functional.

To encrypt the message for the remailer to decypher, you must use
the remailer's public key, which follows.
