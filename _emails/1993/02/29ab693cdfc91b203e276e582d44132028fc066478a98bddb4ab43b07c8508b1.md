I know my reaction when being hit with the ad was,
"Hey! what the fuck is this!?", followed by,
"Okay, this person doesn't know any better".
If you've been on the net for a while, you'd know
that ads are >most< tre gauch.

If we really want to resolve the censorship stigma
and still be able to ignore the ads, perhaps we
could put AD: in front of any ad that was RELEVANT
to the list, and then we could filter them out, or
not, as the case may be.I've got to admit, the idea
of reading ads pertinent to the cypherpunks list
intrigues me.

Judges?
