## Cypherpunks Mailing List Archive

This repository is used to create the jekyll-generated HTML code that is stored in (and served by) the [cryptoanarchywiki/mailing-list-archive](https://github.com/cryptoanarchywiki/mailing-list-archive) repository.

This mailing list archive was generated using raw archives available at [cypherpunks.venona.com/raw/](http://cypherpunks.venona.com/raw/).

The code that was used to parse these archives into a structured database of messages can be found at [tombusby/cypherpunk-mailing-list-archive-parser](https://github.com/tombusby/cypherpunk-mailing-list-archive-parser). The .md files that are used by this repository are also generated by this repo. I will clear this repo up and provide usage instructions in the near future.
